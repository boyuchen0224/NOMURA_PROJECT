What are your thoughts on AI managed funds? (Not talking about ETFs that invest in AI)  
AI is probably more effective in processing considerable more data than a fund manager, but I guess it's still in the early stage.  


What are your thoughts on AI managed funds?

Do you guys know any funds that are managed by AI, that you would suggest?  


Thanks!"

Curious what anyone thinks about this ""idea multiplier"" measure from Vanguard. I was interested bc at first glance this doesn't seem to be the kind of stuff Vanguard would traffic in - i.e. their chief economist literally predicting that 5ish years from now at least 4 industries/fields (materials, oncology, ag, and genetics) could hit some kind of productivity explosion, presumably through AI application. Methodology for the measure seems a little vague, which is understandable I guess if they want to compete. And they're coming out with a paper on it eventually.

10,2019-02-15,ron_leflore,1,Investing in startups as a non-accredited investor.,"A law passed in May 2016 allows startups to raise up to $1 million from non-accredited investors. There's no limit on the number of non-accredited investor, only the amount.  You can now invest in some startups with as little as $50.

Republic.co has done all the legal work to produce a simple standardized agreement, called a [Crowd SAFE](https://republic.co/crowdsafe).  Investors who buy a Crowd SAFE can convert it to stock only when certain liquidity events occur, like when the company gets purchased or an IPO.

The crowd SAFE has two main parameters:  the **valuation cap** and the **discount**.  See here for how they affect the return on your initial investment: https://crowdsafe.info/calculator.html

Some warnings for those who don't know about investing in companies at this stage.

* The investment is illiquid.  You probably can't touch your money for 5-10 years. 

* Most startups fail.  Typical venture capital statistics I've seen are that if you invest in 100 startups, about 30 will fail in the first three years.  Of the remaining 70, 68+ will exit in 6-7 years with a slight return on your money.  So after 7 years, you will have about 0% gain on your initial investment.  Most of the return in venture capital funds is driven by the unicorns, 1% or less of investments that you hear about: facebook, snapchat, airbnb, etc.

* At this stage, most startups are just one or two people with an idea.  You evaluate the people and the idea, but most don't have any substantial products yet.

Here's a few interesting companies raising money on Republic right now.  There's about 15 actively raising and 58 that are done raising on the platform.

**Lavabit** https://republic.co/lavabit
20% Discount, $10 million valuation cap

This is run by the guy who had an ultra secure e-mail service that Edward Snowden used.  He shut down his service when the government served him with a warrant that would force him to turn over his encryption keys so that they could monitor people's emails.  He's got a new way to tackle the problem of secure e-mail.


**Cloudastructure** https://republic.co/cloudastructure
20% discount, $7 million valuation

AI, object detection, and face recognition for enterprise security.  Current security at most companies is easily defeated.  This is a better way that will save them money.  See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rwG5x0Y7Vo


**Ponder**  https://republic.co/ponder
0% discount, $12 million valuation

You can match two people you know for a date.  If they both accept, they each pay $10 to ponder.  Ponder keeps $10 and pays you $10.  Similar for jobs with more money.  You refer a person for a job.  If the hiring company likes the candidate and the candidate likes the company, the company pays Ponder.  You get some cash, ponder gets some cash.

Just throwing it out there that I rarely see good discussions of Blackberry the company on investing subs - they often never go further than ""their devices aren't cool anymore"", but that has little to do with the company, as the devices are just TCL and others using the brand and some services. 

This is more the kind of thing they're doing now, also the realtime OS for many self driving, and their finances have turned around. Price to earnings is rather high, but that's also because earnings are slim but have a roadmap for growth. "
18,2019-03-06,jaxazam,0,Investing with Friends (that isn't r/wallstreetbets),"Me and six of my friends want to pool our money together into the market and create a hedge fund of sorts (not a mutual fund) as a learning experience. A couple of us would be responsible for creating strategies and managing the books / money. The rest of the team would be responsible for the software development (AI / ML models, automatic back testing analysis, sentiment analysis monitoring, integrating with brokerage APIs. etc. etc.)

The proposed structure is that we are the only ones that will be contributing to the fund, with our own personal capital, and we are not taking anybody else's money. There would be one ""head"", and everyone else would be equal partners. Each individual will contribute x% to the fund, and can receive no more than x% back (regardless if you are a partner vs the head). If this turned into something we took more seriously than a hobby, we would then like to look into accepting money from other people, but I bet that's a whole other can of worms.

Best way to think about what we are going for is like a college investment club: you get out whatever percentage you put in, and we're all just trying to learn.

To pre-empt the inevitable comments: We understand that we'd still be considered ""retail investors"" in a sense. We understand that we're not going to be at / near / remotely close to the level of a real fund like Jane Street. We understand that we could decide as a group what our strategy would be, and then assign each individual to be responsible for a portion of the overall strategy. We know that it's probably better to not pool money, even if we are all good friends. 

We're using the whole process - making the business, paperwork and management, creating the technical infrastructure and plans, and strategies - as a learning opportunity.
Given all of that, we're just looking for some direction and advice on how to get started with this. What corporate structure should we do? what advice do you have? anything to keep in mind? Any and all information would be helpful."

&gt; 
&gt; 	Two-fifths of Europe’s artificial intelligence start-ups do not use any AI programs in their products, according to a report that highlights the hype around the technology.
&gt; 
&gt; The research by London-based investment firm MMC Ventures could not find any evidence, based on public information and interviews with executives, of artificial intelligence applications at 40 per cent of 2,830 AI start-ups in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, the companies are often described as AI-focused, said David Kelnar, MMC’s head of research, who added that many start-ups had plans to develop machine-learning programs, an application of AI that sees computers automatically learn and improve from experience, in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; Almost 8 per cent of European start-ups founded last year were AI companies, compared with about 3 per cent in 2015, MMC’s research showed, with the UK taking the lead. The UK has been home to some of the most high-profile AI businesses, which have been bought by foreign buyers, such as Google’s DeepMind, Microsoft’s SwiftKey and Twitter’s Magic Pony.

&gt;However, investors said the industry would have to cut through a growing frenzy around the sector. “Getting stuck in buzzwords is never a good thing,” said Simon Cook, chief executive of Draper Esprit. “AI has become a catch-all phrase that’s often used flippantly.”

* Differ from 2017 and 2016, where logistic execution, expansion, and competing with traditional retailer dominates; in 2018, size, operation complexity, technology and the importance of information sharing and data security, and staff trainings were key topics discussed.
* Noticable new mentioning of supply chain illeffected by climate changes, trade restrictions with Asia and brexit discussions. 

**Recap Footnotes:** 

* Changes to revenue recognition as TJX has adopted ASC 606 on 2/4/2018. Resulted in $59 million increases in retained earnings. Most of the value are unredeemed rewards certificates. Also online shares revenue are recognied at point of shipping rather than receipt. Some expenses are shifted from reduction of revenue to SG&amp;A. Details on income classifications changes can be found in our Footnotes 10-K cliffnotes. 
* In 2018 10-K, TJX has added that future adoption of new accounting standards will result in changes to build-to-suit leases. Its unclear what those changes would be at this point.
* The $500 million revolving credit facility scheduled to mature on March 20121 is extended to March 2022. 
* US Treasury supplmented regulations on 2017 Tax Act will impact TJX filing positions and TJX will record any impacts as a discrete event in the period that the guidance is finalized.
* There is a pre-tex pension settlement charge of $36.1 million resulted from the transferred of $207.4 million of pension plan assets to insurance company.
* Noted numerous highlights by AI in pension plan and other retirement benefits. 

**Recap MD&amp;A:**

* Different from 2017 and 2016, 2018 10-K is more focused on the impacts brought about by the 2017 Tax Act than foundamental changes at firm. It resulted in a net benefit of $0.09 per share for 2018.
* We recommend reading the impact of brexit section in MD&amp;A to further understand management position on the exit and how they are planning to manage the risk
* Noticed a much improved business in Marmaxx and Homegood business though e-commerce continue to not play a significant factor. For Marmaxx, margin wise the 13.5% disguised the 0.4 percent reduction due to Siera impairment and higher incentive compensation and store wage. If operated in similiar environment, the expected margin would be 14.2% which is about the same as fiscal 2017. Homegood margins are under pressue due to higher freight cost, higher distribution cost, and higher wage costs. The collective effect is about 1.1%."

Foreword

It's clear that cryptocurrencies are gradually making inroads into the global economy, moving closer to mass adoption. Cryptocurrencies offer a number of advantages - decentralization and trust, lower commissions and disintermediation - that make it easier for users to carry out their daily transactions. Anybody can transfer value around the globe, winning from fast processing time.

In comparison, sending value across borders via legacy financial systems requires lengthy waiting periods and fees, while also making users stuck into highly complex processes. For instance, if a person from Japan wants to send some money to England, the fees can range anywhere from 5% up to 10%, depending on the system being used. In addition, there will be some currency conversion fees. It seems that centrali paradigm shift change, bringing to the table lightning speeds and lower fees. Although cryptocurrencies have been winning more and more attention from merchants worldwide, there's still a 
number of roadblocks to wider adoption, among which are price volatility, scalability limitations and others.

Volatility is admittedly the biggest hurdle that prevents businesses from using cryptocurrencies more. Bitcoin can experience huge fluctuations in just a matter of hours or even minutes. In addition, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum present scalability issues, which results in high processing time. A merchant, who has to handle hundreds of payments on a daily basis, would not be able to conduct their business efficiently if transactions get stuck for days on end. On top of that, it's extremely hard for adopters to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat via the banks and other financial agents they usually work with.

Either way, you wouldn’t be on this page wondering how to get really rich with your own business. No worries, here you’ll realize what things you can do with the money amount already available in your pocket.

We’ve already seen in [our article](https://blog.s-pro.io/invest-money-business-become-millionaire/) what options are there for you when your goal is to earn some interest. Even more, those methods over time can bring really inspiring results for everyone. [In this piece of work](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-invest-money-business/), I've concentrated more on the last specified option – business. There are many reasons for that. Probably the most important one is that business can bring the biggest revenue out of all other investment options.

## What are the most profitable businesses?

There are uncountable possibilities in every niche. Just check out the empty cells in the Startup Matrix we already described in [our post](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-brainstorm-new-startup-ideas-the-startup-idea-matrix/). We can start listing the actual spheres that are in need of fresh new ideas. But to be of more help to you we better concentrate on the directions in businesses that can be applied to almost every business niche.

What unites every other direction is technology. It has already changed the way all businesses function around the world. There more or less progress here or there, but it is definitely the biggest trend nowadays.

Entrepreneurs are stepping into the tech world with joy because it has already proven the positive effect that tech inclusions do with businesses by scaling them with ease.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning will take away manual operations transforming the way industries will work within just a few years.

### Online business

People are getting more aware of the benefits of online transactions, communication systems and other online platforms offer. Have you considered how much more convenient it is to use contactless payments?

There were many challenges that online businesses have already overcome and continue successfully dealing with nowadays.

### Artificial Intelligence

There have been many debates around AI for years. Nowadays it gets more and more popular and is expected to bring new products with [AI implemented](https://blog.s-pro.io/ai-driven-development-as-an-innovative-market-tendency/) in 2019 and further years.

With AI data analytics will be on hype as artificial intelligence operates with behavioral data of each user.

### Blockchain

Even though the hype around blockchain has been decreased lately, it still has great potential in [transforming all the business niches and everyone’s lives](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-change-the-world-for-the-better-or-our-utopian-future-with-blockchain/). Due to its benefits where the major ones are anonymity, security and interchangeability it has already been implemented in a number of big projects and continues to be in demand.

These are just a few major trends that will rule the business world and continue to be implemented in all areas of our lives. The core feature that unites all of them is an online presence. The mobility it gives to consumers is much appreciated by them. People are getting to feel the benefits of not be tied up to a certain location.

What comes to your mind when you think about mobility? Possibly mobile devices and the growing number of various mobile applications already implemented and growing. The thing is all the mentioned trends can be implemented in businesses via web and mobile applications.

33,2019-05-09,EmmaWatsonsThirdHair,0,The case against Apple (yay!),"First off let's remember the last tech company Buffett bought up was IBM, and look how that turned out. So just because the Oracle of Omaha does something doesn't mean it's de facto correct.

Apple is not a tech company, Apple is a brand, and Tim Cook has said such when asked about Buffett and his investment in Apple. And to me the Apple brand sucks. AirPods are a $160 accessory which have a 1 to 2 year battery life. HomePod is an overpriced speaker with Siri, the worst AI out there. MacBooks don't have touch screens, let alone glitches in the new butterfly keyboards. iPads are severely limited in capabilities, even though they cost as much as a netbook. Apple Watch is as bulky as it is useless. iPhone is fine, but proportionate to the price there are better and more useful Android phones out there with the same if not better quality.

Apple's new services are a joke. Regardless of the fact that the actual services are underwhelming at best and useless at worst, why won't they come with an Apple product? Why do I have to pay Apple for their product so I can have the privilege of paying them even more for a service? It's ridiculous.

Speaking of ridiculous, Apple credit card. This product is so un innovative, so cash grabby, even the most ardent sheeple pause for a second before saying ""it has no fees and looks cool"" as if Apple is the only credit card with no fees /s

Tim Cook, and by extension Apple, are only concerned about their bottom line, and in tech that's the first sign of a company destined for mediocrity. Look at the latest innovations: Amazon Alexa, Uber, Doordash, Airbnb, Twitter, cloud computing, Oculus. Apple doesn't take risks, nor get involved in any meaningful way with the next big things. Let's remember Siri started out as an app on iPhone, caught Steve Jobs' attention, and was bought out and subsequently integrated in iPhone.

Market cap isn't really that meaningful, but for what it's worth Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are all closely tied and nearing a trillion dollar market cap. And regardless of Apple's supply chain in China and the current trade war and tariffs, I see Apple as a company unable to innovate on anything unless it strengthens their brand, Amazon as a company that's overextended and wildly overvalued, and Microsoft a company poised to become the cool brand to Apple. Google is an absolute mess of a company, and while they make great apps and software, they don't make the best hardware and don't seem interested in creating their own brick and mortar stores to go all in with regard to all their hardware devices, however they have a strong and consistent business model in creating Internet apps subsidized by advertising revenue in their core search product. And to me even that has more future potential than a status symbol and expendable wealth brand like Apple and Apple's products."
34,2019-05-08,premium-domains,1,2019 is a profitable time for domain name selling,"Many people think that they're 20 years too late to profit on buying and selling domain names. And that was mostly true 2-3 years ago, when classic .com-ish domains still dominated.

But today .com, .org etc. are heavily oversaturated extensions that are becoming less and less valuable, while newer extensions (e.g. .io, .co, .ai, .cloud) are becoming increasingly popular and trusted.

This is happening because the internet isn't exactly getting less popular worldwide of course, and because there are always new businesses starting up - and every single one of them need a nice and short domain name.

Good luck finding a .com domain that you actually want today. Instead, for example, if your users are mainly under 30 years old, a short .io domain is now more attractive for your site than whatever .com domain you can find.

To get a good idea about what sells these days, watch the domain marketplaces, like [this one](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/marketplace/featured-domains/). I'm not affiliated with this site, but it's the only one I have experience with. **Be warned that some domain registrars will try to cheat you in shady ways, even the big ones, [as this redditor discovered](https://old.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/a3ppu2/do_not_use_godaddy_to_register_your_domain/).** It's valuable to read the comments in that thread, because they consist of people's experiences about various registrars. This will give you a better idea about who are trustworthy."

20 years ago MSFT was also number one company by market cap in the world followed by a relatively diverse group of ""old-money"" companies like GE, oil/gas companies, Coca-Cola etc. 

Given the acceleration of ""tech companies"" over the past 20 years allowing the other three to join Microsoft in being the biggest, is there any reason to think they'll lose momentum any time in the near or long future to another industry?

Any futuristic fields like AI/AR/VR that are gaining momentum will either be dominated via the big 4/5, or by a start-up that's inevitably absorbed by one of the big 4/5--and at this point in time it's hard to imagine a separate industry, whether or not it exists today overtaking what we have in place for technology today.

Compared to the past dominant industries, e.g. telecommunications, oil/gas, banking, health care, even without the aid of hindsight it seems like there was eventually a peak there, or potential for a new industry to come in. But for me it's hard to see with 'technology' as it is today."

42,2019-06-12,NomadicAstronaut,6,Best way to invest money outside of the US?,"Hello Reddit.

**Intro**

I've received **$400,000 tax-free**, which I am unsure what to do with. I'm a **24 year-old dual US/EU citizen**, who moved from the US to Europe to do a PhD in AI/machine-learning. I don't plan on returning to the US permanently and I'm a bit weary about keeping money there. How can I invest this money outside of the US? And, should I?

**Lifestyle**

Evidently, I live a pretty frugal lifestyle; I've already been able to save \~$24,000 after 1.5 years on this meager PhD salary, even with extensive backpacking trips. Once the PhD is finished (age 26), I expect to get a research position in Europe, which I expect to pay ≥$110,000. I don't have any debt at all and I have excellent credit.

**Intentions**

I would like to invest this money somewhere and reinvest its returns, as I don't think I'd need this money for quite awhile, but I don't know where to start. I don't have any investment experience, except a $200 investment when I was 19 in a graphite company during Tesla's uprising, whose share prices have gone to $0 (fail). Mainly, I want this money to give me financial independence and security, as well as the possibility to do cool things like buying an AirBNB property in south France.

**Dilemma**

From what I understand, the US tax system is more conducive to making money than within the EU. But at the same time, the US taxes global income (if earning ≥$103,900), potentially hindering my life outside of the US and motivating me to renounce my citizenship in the future. How should I invest in this situation? Perhaps creating an off-shore company is the solution?

**Thanks Reddit**"

Hey guys, my colleagues and I have worked on a neural network model that predicts if a loan is a good buy.

We have background in the finance industry (me personally is ex - Goldman Sachs). With the current break through in artificial intelligence, our goal is to eventually build out an auto invest service utilizing this technology. We've been testing our model 2 years ago and our avg annual return is about 13% (compounded).

That being said, I would appreciate feedback from the community on what we've been building so far. So we've released a google chrome extension that have access to the core AI model (without the auto invest service).

The approach is using over 70 variables and indicators (both macro and micro) to optimize and pick out loans with maximum return while having the lowest risks. (Think 70 dimension efficiency frontier curve which is only possible with AI given computer resource limitations). Any feedback is much appreciated.

**Foreword**

It's clear that cryptocurrencies are gradually making inroads into the global economy, moving closer to mass adoption. Cryptocurrencies offer a number of advantages - decentralization and trust, lower commissions and disintermediation - that make it easier for users to carry out their daily transactions. Anybody can transfer value around the globe, winning from fast processing time.

In comparison, sending value across borders via legacy financial systems requires lengthy waiting periods and fees, while also making users stuck into highly complex processes. For instance, if a person from Japan wants to send some money to England, the fees can range anywhere from 5% up to 10%, depending on the system being used. In addition, there will be some currency conversion fees. It seems that centralized players, currently enjoying lack of competition, set up fees and commissions just as they wish.

And it's merchants that carry out cross-border transactions that find working with legacy finance institutions most troublesome. They keep losing hefty chunks from their potential profits, just paying out fees to payment processors. This makes businesses hike up their prices, passing these expenses to ordinary consumers. Crypto offers a paradigm shift change, bringing to the table lightning speeds and lower fees. Although cryptocurrencies have been winning more and more attention from merchants worldwide, there's still a number of roadblocks to wider adoption, among which are price volatility, scalability limitations and others.

Volatility is admittedly the biggest hurdle that prevents businesses from using cryptocurrencies more. Bitcoin can experience huge fluctuations in just a matter of hours or even minutes. In addition, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum present scalability issues, which results in high processing time. A merchant, who has to handle hundreds of payments on a daily basis, would not be able to conduct their business efficiently if transactions get stuck for days on end. On top of that, it's extremely hard for adopters to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat via the banks and other financial agents they usually work with. 

Cryptocurrencies seek to offer solutions to all of these issues. 

**What is stablecoin?** 

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency, whose architecture enables its price to always equal the price of another asset. Most of the stablecoins are pegged to USD. The biggest names in cryptocurrencies are Tether, Gemini Dollar, USDQ, TUSD and others. 

**How do stablecoins manage to be so stable?**

As opposed to other coins that float freely, stable cryptocurrencies require that each unit is backed with a unit of the fiat currency. For instance, Tether (USDT) pegs 1 USDT to 1 USD on the one-to-one basis. In this way, stablecoins are somewhere between cryptocurrencies and regular fiats. Tether is based on its own blockchain that is built on top of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum systems.

Although Tether is the biggest stablecoin, there's a number of concerns as to its operations. The biggest one is the continuing controversy as to the fiat reserves, which the issuer is supposed to store on the one-to-one ratio to the number of issued Tether units. The company has been saying that the audit will be done in the near future, but just several weeks ago it started to claim that it's not only the cash, but also loans to other companies that can be recorded as fiat reserves. These statements resulted in growing distrust among crypto enthusiasts.

Another project is TrueUSD (TUSD). It also pegs to USD. The difference with Tether is the openness to audits and transparency. The company is open to third-party audits, it publishes the duly verified reports on the fiat reserves it holds. In addition, users enjoy legal protections.

USDC is another stablecoin that was created by the famous cryptocurrency exchange Circle. Just as TUSD, if offers regulatory compliance and transparency. The big problem about all these systems is the fact that they enable authorities to seize users’ funds, which completely negates the very idea of decentralization and anti-censorship, on which crypto is built.

USDQ is different from other stablecoins as it's not backed by the fiat currency, but by Bitcoin and other  top-10 cryptocurrencies in the future. This enables the ecosystem to avoid dealing with legacy financial systems. Through the overcollateralization process, USDQ turns highly volatile cryptocurrencies into the USD-pegged USDQ that is perfect for storing value and processing transactions in the external economy without any risk of price changes. The coin is being developed by PLATINUM ENGINEERING with the small community slowly growing around the project. 

**Why do we need stablecoins?**

Stablecoins have advanced as a new iteration on cryptocurrencies, enabling to address such issues as high volatility and interactions with legacy financial systems. 

Coins like USDQ make sure that various mechanisms are used in order to stabilize the prices at the USD peg. Traders can easily change their Bitcoins into USDQ and thus prevent the negative impact on unwanted prices changes. Stablecoins are very easy to use, which is a boon for non-techy adopters. Any person from around the world can quickly convert fiats into stablecoins, without any need to think about future price changes and without worrying about potential risks for losing their funds. As a rule, you'll always find various stablecoins on crypto exchanges, enabling traders to quickly move around stables and other cryptos. 

As we've spoken above, cross-border payments win most from using the stablecoins. This hybrid species between fiat and crypto will help open up the hidden value in global trade, amounting to trillions of dollars in profits for stakeholders.

53,2019-07-11,Naan_Deal,1,Altitude Group Plc (LON:ALT) - the promotional products monster. Potential to become a Billion $ company.," 

(Disclosure: I hold 125k+ shares in ALT)

I have been researching and buying ALT for 6 months now, and thought I would share some of my research. The next update is due at the end of August/early September.

Quick snapshot of company:[ https://ibb.co/hdRMkJ4](https://ibb.co/hdRMkJ4) (They have \~£7m more cash than listed here due to placing in early 2019)

ALT operates in the USA, but is listed on the U.K. AIM marketplace, as that is where the legacy business is situated. I wouldn't be surprised to see a dual listing in a few years. In my opinion the business is undervalued by a factor of 10, in part because of the U.K. listing and the lack of broker coverage (only 1 broker covers it atm).

The only broker notes available on the stock are written by Finncap. The company looks dirt cheap on their forecasts, yet I believe that their forecasts are extremely conservative.

My notes:

Altitude Research - basic

29/5/19

**What do ALT do?**

Altitude (ALT) own AIM, the largest promotional products distributor member group in the US.

Promotional products are branded merchandise produced for companies, usually for marketing purposes. Think a cap, or pen, with the Google logo on it for example.

A distributor member group is where a group of smaller market distributors club together to achieve benefits from scale such as wholesale supplier discounts, for example.

ALT also own AIMPro, an online tech platform for the AIM member group that provides additional online services to AIM members (distributors) and those that supply them.

Promotional products is a $23bn mkt in the USA.

* Highly fragmented.
* Only 23% of business is done online.
* 42% of the market share is from 22,700 small distributors with revs &lt;$2.5mil/year.
* \&gt;88.5% of orders placed face to face/fax/phone/email.
* &lt;11.5% of orders processed online with small distributors.

The above suggests to me that there may be huge potential for consolidation in the market, and also for market participants to move their business online.

ALT’s AIM is the largest player in the market, having an 8% market share, with $1.9bn in member revenues. Next largest competitors by sales are 4imprint (LON:FOUR) $608m, and Staples, $592m.

The AIM member group was, in part, created to counter the potentially monopolistic threat from large online retailers.

(As an aside, staff seem to be happy to leave 4imprint and other competitors to come to AIM:

“we are delighted to have appointed Stacey McConnell as Vice President of Member Services who has over 20 years' experience at top 40 distributor companies, including 4imprint and AIA Corporation, and Cathy Cummings as Head of Vendor Relations who has over 18 years' experience with 4imprint and AIA Corporation.”)

&amp;#x200B;

**ALT’s AIM progress since Jan acquisition:**

Preferred Suppliers:

Suppliers to AIM members (distributors) pay a % of sales to ALT to become “preferred suppliers”. In return they get heavy marketing of their products to the AIM members (in trade mags, industry emails etc.) and AIM members get discounts when buying from them.

New preferred supplier agreements, replacing the prior agreements, have been signed with 150 suppliers, down from 280 in Jan. Management want to reduce total preferred supplier numbers to concentrate sales to the best and most efficient operators. They can also charge preferred suppliers more as the preferred supplier slots become harder to get, and more valuable as AIM membership and therefore throughput revenue grows.

Management say goal is “Strengthening and securing high performance partner suppliers and purposefully reducing those who dilute performance of the supply chain”.

Expect more preferred suppliers to be signed in 2019, apparently 250 is the final target.

Management are also planning to introduce extra “packages” for suppliers, which potentially are tiered memberships in similar fashion to those which are outlined for distributors below. There will be three packages (tiers?), Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. This allows for additional monetisation of suppliers beyond just the % of order value. Details on this front are scarce at the moment however.

**Preferred suppliers pay ALT 3-6% of all orders of supply order value**, depending on how the order was made. I have been informed that they pay up to 6% for offline sales, and up to 16% for online, but have not been able to fact check this.

Members (Distributors):

There are now 3 tiers of AIM membership: (these are how ALT monetises the members’ throughput revenues)

* AIM BASIC **$59 flat fee**(all AIM members were on this before ALT got involved) Current member benefits package:
   * AIM BASIC will represent the standard AI Mastermind membership. However, **all members will be required to send data via EasySync meaning all orders are captured and invoiceable to the AIMPro preferred supplier regardless of how or where the order is processed.** The average percentage GTR gained by AIMPro is dependent on the member throughput and influenced by whether it is derived online (at a higher rate) or offline.
* AIM MARKETPRO **$59 +3% of gross member revenue**. Access to marketing and tech tools.
   * AIM MARKETPRO customers gain further benefits from enhanced membership including a full order processing system and quotes system, supplier follow up, some artwork and digitisation, and weekly social media posting. The cost to the member will include the base membership fee of US$59 per month plus a percentage of their gross transaction value.
* AIM SALESPRO **$59 +6% of gross member revenue**. Access to all above + business, customer service, and sales admin assistance.
   * AIM SALESPRO customers benefit from full business management, full customer service support, full artwork/digitisation, and enhanced healthcare and retirement benefit packages. The cost to the member will include the base membership fee of US$59 per month plus a higher percentage of their gross transactional value.

If signed up for the new, higher tiered packages “MARKETPRO”, and “SALESPRO”, **AIM members get 1% cashback** when ordering from preferred suppliers.

51 AIM Members are now on these higher tier packages. Billing commenced 1st May. 400 tiered members expected by YE2019.

Average member (distributor) revenue has risen from $870k (Jan presentation figure) --&gt; $916k (May) (+5.3%)

Member numbers have gone from 1917 (Nov) --&gt; 2108 (May) (+10% in 5-6 months vs. 23% increase 17-18).

As a result, AIM throughput sales have gone from $1.66bn --&gt; $1.9bn (+14.5% in 5 months)

&amp;#x200B;

**AIMPro (Tech Suite):**

AIM Pro is “a patented technology platform for distributors which has a supply chain already built in and combines an ecommerce trading platform with a cloud based CRM and order management system that enables both offline and online promotional product transactions to be executed.”

AIMPro is important as it provides opportunities for ALT to charge for additional services as part of the tiered pricing model.

Member sales through AIM pro have risen from $19.9m in FY2018 → $31m in the first 5 months of 2019 ($48.9 FY19 assuming no uptick in current growth rate), however rate IS accelerating ($1mil/week in March → over $2mil/week in April).

* AIMPro ordering member growth 60.9% YTD vs. same 20 week period last year.
* Sales order growth 56.2% YTD vs same 20 week period last year.
* 893 AIM members already using ALT tools.
* 2900 live websites and company stores.

AIMPro was previously ALT’s bread and butter - charging AIM members to use. Now with acquisition of AIM, monetisation no longer solely reliant on AIMPro usage.

&amp;#x200B;

**EasySync:**

This is because of EasySync, which all AIM members are required to use. To repeat myself, this a service whereby all orders are captured and invoiceable to the AIM preferred supplier regardless of how or where the order is processed (fax/phone/online/face-to-face). The average percentage GTR (gross transactional revenue) gained by AIM is dependent on the member throughput and influenced by whether it is derived online (at a higher rate) or offline.

In other words, using EasySync allows ALT to invoice suppliers for all their sales to AIM members, whereas previously ALT could only invoice suppliers for orders conducted via AIMPro.

**Additional value here is the data gathered from EasySync/the AIMPro platform**. Once captured when,what, and where members are ordering can fine tune with suppliers to improve efficiencies and in turn drive greater order flow. (simplistic e.g. Water bottles selling well at start of summer. AIM EasySync data shows, goes to suppliers, suppliers know to hold more stock, widen bottle range etc). **This data has huge $ value to the industry**, as it is essentially market research, driving efficiencies, and saving market participants money.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, it is my opinion that ALT is massively undervalued. They have captured the \~$2bn of revenues of the AIM member group, and it is now a matter of when, not a matter of if, they monetise these revenues.

I will provide full disclosure of my portfolio at the end of every post.

**SHORT:**

**Veritone (VERI)**

*Today's price $7.70 Today's movement -5.75% Market Cap (Yahoo Finance) $156.6M*

**Summary:** Veritone markets itself as an AI software company, but can be viewed more as a SAAS company. They provide services to M&amp;E (Media &amp; Entertainment), Government, and Legal &amp; Compliance. The AI component of their software comes from facial and item recognition. For instance, its AI can learn what a customer logo looks like and then show how many impressions of the logo appears in a video. Its AI can also, recognize a face in a surveillance video and identify the suspect.

Veritone can help its customers cut expenses via labor hours and provide a revenue stream because its AI edits videos. For M&amp;E, companies can charge customers the ability to find clips of a specific person in their content (for example an athlete in a sports event). In government, man-hours are saved because an official does not have to watch the whole surveillance video. The portion of the video without the perpetrator will be edited out.

I believe there is great value in Veritone's software, but I don't believe in Veritone's run rate. Veritone reminds me of another company, HMNY (owner of Moviepass). HMNY's stock like Veritone's skyrocketed in the beginning because of FOMO investors and large fanfare. HMNY was bleeding cash and sold equity to become cash positive. HMNY stock price suffered because of this. HMNY's stock price went so low it did a 1 for 250 reverse stock-split so it could continue to be listed on Nasdaq and raise cash at a higher stock price. HMNY's stock is now a penny stock.

I recommend short Veritone until it can prove to be cash flow positive from operations. Veritone can become cash flow positive because of tailwinds like new legislation in California, Ohio, and many other states forcing law enforcement to disclose a redacted version of their audio and video-based evidence on a far more rapid timeline. Until then, the cash burn and dilution will cause the share price to slide once again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts for Short**:

**1.** **Veritone will continue to issue common stock to be cash flow positive and dilute investors.**

Q4 2018 Shares outstanding was 19,335,220.

Veritone issued 662,000 common stock in Q1 2019 (3.4%)

Q1 2019 Shares outstanding was 20,197,188.

**2**. **Additional dilution, such as Acacia Research has 1.1 million warrants priced at $13.61 and acquisitions are being funded partially by equity.**

The warrants are not in the money yet. If Veritone's stock price does increase, Acacia will dilute current investors even further.

Veritone acquired three companies this past year. More information can be read in ""Recent Acquisitions"" far below.

**3. Not enough revenue growth to offset net loss**

Revenue was $12.1M, an increase of 177% vs Q1 2018. This according to the earnings call happened from acquisitions and organic growth. The acquisitions caused SG&amp;A to increase more too so the net loss was (16,306) vs (13,047) in Q1 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts for Potential Long:**

**1. Proof of repeat customers: ESPN and Golden Boy.**

**ESPN**

**Golden Boy (via acquisition of Wazee)**

**2. Revenue growth opportunity with new legislation in California, Ohio, and other states**

Aforementioned, new legislation will force law enforcement to disclose a redacted version of their audio and video-based evidence on a far more rapid timeline. Veritone is primed to serve this market.

**3. Insider buying, strong management, and a strong board of directors**

CEO Chad Steelberg ($7.54/share), President Ryan Steelberg ($7.49/share), and Board Member Richard H. Taketa ($7.49/share) bought shares within the last month

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst for Long or Short (depending on outlook):**

**1. Rejected Apis Capital hostile takeover bid**

In December 2018, Apis Capital offered to acquire Veritone at $10.26/share, an 82% premium at that time. Apis Capital subsequently withdrew its bid. This can be viewed as management's competence or incompetence.

**Competent**

Management was competent and believed the 82% premium was too small. Management believes the share price can be above $10.26/share soon.

**Incompetent**

Management was incompetent and did not look out for shareholders as the stock price is well below that today.

&amp;#x200B;

**Recent Acquisitions (From 10-Q):**

**Acquired Performance Bridge (8.21.18)**

Veritone paid initial consideration of $5,158 and will pay a total of $3,909 in additional contingent earnout amounts for certain revenue milestones achieved by Performance Bridge in its 2018 fiscal year. The acquisition of Performance Bridge has expanded the Company’s media agency offerings of comprehensive podcast solutions.

**Acquired Wazee Digital (8.31.18)**

Veritone paid an aggregate purchase price of $12,552, comprised of $7,423 paid in cash and the issuance of a total of 491,157 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $5,129 based on the Company’s closing stock price on August 31, 2018.

The acquisition of Wazee Digital has expanded the Company’s offerings to include digital content management and licensing solutions.

**Acquired Machine Box (9.6.18)**

Veritone paid initial consideration of $1,484, and the Company may pay up to an additional $3,000 in contingent amounts if Machine Box achieves certain technical development and integration milestones within 12 months after the closing of the acquisition, a portion of which was paid in the first quarter of 2019.

In March 2019, the Company determined that Machine Box had achieved the technical development and integration milestones required to be completed as of March 6, 2019 and, as a result, the former Machine Box stockholders became entitled to receive an aggregate of $200 in cash and an aggregate of 135,583 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $880 based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on March 6, 2019.

Machine Box is a developer of state-of-the-art machine learning technologies, which have enhanced the Company’s aiWARE platform capabilities.

60,2019-08-23,grittygatorr,150,Serious: What does a quant trader/statistician/mathematician exactly do while trading?," (Posted earlier on [r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/))

Hey Traders!

The question pretty much sums it all. I am a semi-professional futures trader (CL, ZT, ZS, some crypto), who uses basic technical indicators since two years and has been fairly profitable.

That said, I don't understand the rush towards all things maths and statistics as a basic requirement to trade - if hedge fund and prop trading positions are considered.

So here's my humble question - where exactly does complex math, statistical model making, and computer programming come into the picture? Software dev positions are explanatory, but where do the aforementioned help? Doesn't the first rule of markets say you can't predict prices and movements?

Or is everyone rushing towards complex solutions which could have been solved fairly easily?

Worse still - are talks of ML, RL, AI, algo, etc a ""gimmick"" to attract investor capital?

All thoughts would be very, very helpful.

PS - Don't make this a discussion about TA vs Quant. I do use indicators to trade, but definitely, don't draw discretionary trend lines or watch ""heads and shoulders"" or analyze moon phases to place trades. In fact, I do think TA is complete bull, but using indicators has its logical reasons."

67,2019-10-22,GWP5,0,Does Technical Analysis still work to make a living daytrading with?," 

Around 15 years ago I knew someone online who talked about how they made a good living doing nothing but day trading all day using technical analysis methods.

I considered giving it a try back then, but didn't.

Today I'm wondering if it's still a viable way to make money as a full time job, or if changes in technology and markets have altered that strategy.

Why would time alter it?

1. I've heard that with the increased processing power and AI sophistication that big players in the markets are able to make more money by buying and selling on very small margins using automated systems. If these systems were really that common they could feasibly alter the way the market behaves and how easy it is for an individual doing things manually to scrap off their profits.
2. Maybe the markets behave differently after both the tech bubble burst and the the housing crisis? All the books I bought on the subject are at least 15-20 years old.
3. Potentially more people trying to day trade and do technical analysis could potentially alter the way it works and how easy it is, couldn't it? Maybe things weren't as sophisticated 20 years ago and fewer people were trying to do it?"

In the biggest-ever takeover in the luxury-goods industry, lvmh, a French global conglomerate, announced its acquisition of **Tiffany**, an American jeweller founded in 1837 and known for its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. lvmh is paying $16.9bn, more than the roughly $14.5bn that was suggested when the transaction was first mooted in late October. The deal represents a success for Bernard Arnault, lvmh’s boss and controlling shareholder, who had courted Tiffany for some time. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/lvmh-tests-the-limits-of-luxury).

## The magic trick

The flotation of **Alibaba’s** shares on the Hong Kong stockmarket raised $11.2bn, making it the most valuable share offering this year, ahead of the $8.1bn that Uber raked in at its ipo in May. The stock rose by 6.6% on the first day of trading in what is a secondary listing in Alibaba. Its shares are also listed in New York. See [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21775688).

**Uber** lost its licence to operate in London, again. The ride-hailing company has 45,000 drivers in the city, one of its biggest markets. London’s transport regulator raised more concerns about safety, including 14,000 fraudulent trips by unauthorised drivers. Uber is appealing against the decision and can continue to operate while it does so. See [article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/11/27/london-hits-uber-hard-and-hails-a-fleet-of-new-cheaper-apps).

The chief executive of **Westpac** resigned and the chairman said he would step down next year, as Australia’s second-largest bank faced mounting criticism about its response to a money-laundering scandal. A regulator has accused Westpac of failing to monitor more than 23m suspect transactions, some of which enabled child exploitation in the Philippines. The bank has found itself in politicians’ cross-hairs. Australia’s treasurer said it had been indifferent to the scandal; the attorney-general noted that it was an “unbelievably serious” matter. Westpac has reportedly cancelled its Christmas party.

**Charles Schwab**, America’s biggest discount broker, struck a $26bn deal to acquire **td** **Ameritrade**, a rival. The pair had recently been engaged in a price war, both ditching the transaction fees they charged customers. The combined group will have around $5trn in client assets. See [article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/11/30/charles-schwab-agrees-to-buy-td-ameritrade-for-26bn).

The **Brazilian real** fell to a new low against the dollar, after Brazil’s finance minister said he was “not worried” about a strong greenback. The slide prompted a brief intervention by the central bank to prop up the currency. The country’s current-account deficit has risen sharply this year, and interest rates have tumbled.

**Google** reportedly fired four employees who had been active in organising protests at the company and had apparently tried to gain access to private internal documents. The tech giant pioneered an office culture that mixes politics with work, which it may now regret. Vociferous staff have pressed management to drop an ai contract for the Pentagon and have walked out over sexual harassment and a search-engine project for the Chinese government.

America’s Federal Aviation Administration said it alone would inspect the **737** max before it is returned to service, relieving Boeing of the exercise and signalling that it will sign off each jet individually.

**Tesla’s** share price struggled to recover from the drubbing it took after an unforeseen event at the launch of its new Cybertruck, which has been described as a cross between a futuristic car from “Blade Runner” and a SpongeBob SquarePants character. The vehicle’s supposedly armoured-glass windows shattered when a steel ball was hurled at them during a demonstration. “Maybe that was a little too hard,” said a startled Elon Musk, Tesla’s boss.

76,2019-11-23,Yottahz,1,Experimenting with AI for investing,"I have long been fascinated with AI.  AGI yes, but even now on just specific tasks.   I am somewhat convinced that even seemingly random events are predictable given enough input data.

Just as it was possible back in the day for two people in a garage to start a computer company and a revolution, today it looks like the technology and hardware is within reach of a motivated individual.   Companies like Google are making platforms available.

Have any of you given some thought to tinkering around with this for investing, or just back testing some data to see what trends it might predict?   I am not saying you will come up with some game changing model or that you should put any real money into something you build up, but just from a curiosity standpoint?"

I am mainly interested in IT/AI, Financials, and Healthcare.

I'm currently 23 and would like to use the money in my brokerage account in \~5-7 years to use as a downpayment on a house. I don't have any debt and I currently contribute $500 a month to my Roth (one single mutual fund) and $500 cash into my brokerage account. I do not plan to touch my roth but I do plan to take from my other investment account which is 60% cash and 40% in a S&amp;P etf. I do have an emergency fund for 6months worth of expenses.

80,2019-12-28,RobertKesselring,1,Have we had our last recession ever?,"We've had a long run of phenomenal growth... Longer and better than any previous expansion in history. Maybe that's because we've been lucky and just haven't run into anything in a while that was enough to cause a downturn, or maybe there is an underlying strong reason for the continued growth...

The only thing that can drive per-capita economic activity in an upward trend is improvement in productivity. There have been periods where other factors temporarily depressed productivity, but eventually technological advancement wins out and drives productivity further up. The faster tech improves, the bigger shock will be needed to halt growth.

Technology can advance because more people are working to advance it. As economies around the world grow, a higher percentage of people get education, and the more people are capable of contributing to technological advancement. Also, the higher the population, the more people there are who can contribute to advancement.

Finally, the biggest factor may be AI. It's come a long way in the last 10 years and it will never regress. It will only ever get better. Right now this means human creativity is augmented to an ever increasing degree. Eventually, it will be smarter than we are and human genius will no longer be the driving force of technological advancement. Someone coined a term for this... It's called the technological spike.

When the spike happens, it will probably be the companies that own the tech that benefit the most. Those companies will probably be the biggest companies with the biggest R&amp;D budgets. If we're already close enough to the spike that the upward trend dominates external downward pressures, then we've passed a run-away tipping point and the economy may no longer be capable of contraction.

So what do you think? Should I max out my margin in anticipation of ever accelerating growth?"

83,2019-12-18,Reverenter,1,"""During a gold rush, sell shovels.""","As the old saying goes, the most surefire method of profiting off of an emerging market is to enable others to seize the opportunity rather than trying your luck yourself. So in that spirit, I wanted to open up a discussion about emerging markets and the companies that enable them in hopes that our collective insight will point us towards profitable investments that we can all benefit from. 

Below is a list of the emerging markets that come to my mind. This certainly isn't exhaustive, so input of additional upcoming markets is appreciated. Just to reiterate, the goal isn't to speculate which companies will be the leaders in these areas (ex. NFLX for Streaming Services), but rather identify the companies who are best positioned to enable these industries as a whole (ex. ROKU for Streaming Services):

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* 5G Wireless Networks
* SmartHome Devices &amp; IoT
* Meat Substitutes / Lab-grown meat products
* Satellite Internet
* Virtual Reality
* Cloud Infrastructure and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
* Drone Technology
* Streaming Services
* Electric Vehicles (EVs)

Yet this is exactly where we have gone. Despite retarded leadership America leads the pack and is dominating the world economically. Wages are rising, jobs are growing, and the stock market is doing better than ever. 

With that said, all the talk of recession a year or even months ago now seems silly. America will be victorious in the trade war because we have all the cards. And technology driven growth brought by AI and machine learning will further drive the economy. How could we possibly have a recession at this point? Do you guys really expect the stock market to go down? It seems the likelihood of recession now is now lower than ever. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have a real stock market pullback until 2030!"

87,2019-12-05,EEBucks,1,"401k picks - mine, yours?","Over the past 2 years I’ve found a new hobby, my new favorite hobby to be honest, of following economic data and the global economy, the markets, and trading. More recently, I’ve just started working full time (less than a year now), so while I have learned a lot in the trading / market / economy arenas I haven’t dabbled too much into the INVESTING (long term, compounding yield, etc). 

With that said, I gotta get good at this 401k game. So what are your best Buy and hold forever names that pay a dividend with decent growth potential? What other investments do you make to get consistent, solid yields? I don’t know anything about bonds (have yet to study up on em) other than its buying debt and the phrase “trillions in negative yielding debt”. What markets do you see becoming massive in the next 10-20 years and now would be a good time to buy in?

My 401k:
Healthcare 25% - it was so beaten up earlier this year I couldn’t not buy in at the lows (owned for a little while now)

MJ 10% - pot etf, bought it at $16.22 because I believe in the weed industry long term and technicals showed possible capitulation on its move down to $16ish so I figured why not dabble, pays ~1% dividend right now (recent buy in) 

GDX 25% - I think the dollar will lose value and I believe gold fundamentally beats fiat currencies ever since the dollar left the gold standard, historical charts would agree. Plus GDX had a massive falling wedge that was rejecting resistance and holding support like clockwork, bought in at $26.60, pays ~1% dividend. (Recent buy in) 

International 40% - I think there will be a capital shift away from the United States markets and back into Europe, decent dividends hoping it will grow. (Been in for not too long but not crazy recent) 

Sectors I want to invest in long term but have no positions, any name recommendations with good growth potential for price and dividends? 

5G
AI / Robotics
Renewable Energy
Autonomous Vehicles (Drones / self driving cars)
Weed
Space? We gonna be mining asteroids in 10 years? 
Any other cool, young, high potential sector recommendations appreciated!"
88,2019-12-01,wileywyatt,1,CRSP Investing &amp; Research,"I’ve owned CRSP stock since January 2019, and 12/20 $80 Calls since November 20th. I expect the stock to continue on its recent surge pass December, have a correction January/February 2020, and continue on a long-term upward trend for the next 3+ years.

When it comes to gene-replacement, there aren’t very many options. You can either use Crispr, or modified viruses. The difference is similar to “cutting” &amp; “pasting” with a scalpel, versus exploding &amp; inserting with a bomb. Modified viruses have been around for decades, but Crispr is the newest tech in this field.

The biggest thing holding back gene-modification isn’t actually our technological advancements, it’s our understanding of the human genome. The Human Genome Project started in 1990, in order to categorize all of human DNA sequencing, and it still has a long way to go. A “simple” thing like eye color isn’t just in 1 place of your DNA, but is in several dozen places &amp; the regions vary based on the individual. With increasingly better computing &amp; AI, we’ve gotten better at understanding all of human DNA &amp; *where* to alter it.

Gene-editing has just begun, and it isn’t going away. People will alter their sequencing for both necessity &amp; personal preferences in the future, and there will be a lot of money to be made in it. I recommend all long-term investors to hold some shares of CRSP, and I welcome short-term traders to ride the wave where they see potential to do so."
