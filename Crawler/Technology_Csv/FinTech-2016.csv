1,2016-01-11,yontodd,19,FT: Why Lending Club has shunned securitisations,"Very interesting read. [Link here](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/01/11/2149760/why-lending-club-has-shunned-securitisations/).

&gt;What started as “peer to peer” lending has become deeply immeshed in the machinery of Wall Street. But in becoming entwined with old finance, many of the purported benefits of online lending have quickly disappeared. So despite the talk of “transparency”, the sort of granular loan level data available through a marketplace lender’s website or API disappears in a securitisation, where you just have another pool of loans with all the typical risks around borrower data and the incentives for a lender that makes most of its money from churning out new loans to loosen its underwriting standards. So as marketplace lending interacts with old finance, its deficiencies are exposed and investors ask for protection.

&gt;In other words, a good way of getting perspective on fintech is to see what happens when the capital markets are asked to buy the hype."

3,2016-04-05,ProfitMonger,0,Trends for 20-35 year investment horizon,"I wanted to start a conversation and get feed back from the community about trends and stocks related to those trends, that will provide the greatest wealth expansion in the next 20-35 years.  I am 29 years old, have 26K in a 401K and 5K in a personal investment account.  Here are some of the things I see growing tremendously over that timeframe. Please add more! please add associated stocks and reasoning also:

3D printing-  A wide variety of materials have been made to be printable.  When the technology becomes quick enough for mass production... watch out.

FinTech- Financial Technology companies IMO will outperform the market.  Square, Paypal, AliPay, ApplePay, etc.  There is a lot of competition that may hurt the industry in the short run, but I have a CRAZY hypothesis that these companies may cause many regional and national banks to close.  Companies like Apple, Alibaba, and Samsung have enough free cash flow to provide credit to small business owners and individuals a like.  They take any payment method.  They provide instant access to funds and credit, they provide detailed analysis about the company, and provide excellent B2B relationships.

Green Energy- Wind and Solar especially will continue to advance.  Even with the low cost of oil, I believe that these energies are well positioned for the future.

Robotics- Robots will take over the world

Exoskeleton suits-  great technology for the handicapped, however i see the biggest growth in this segment coming from military and police outfits.

4,2016-07-08,AspiringGuru,2,What do you want in a stockmarket app/website?,"Hi /r/investing.

Delurking for some advice and gauging interest.

Some friends and I are entering a fintech hackathon this weekend and looking for inspiration on what functionality to build into an app/website.

There are a few basic chart styles we intend to do. I know r/investing dislikes the 'one rule to invest by' but I also believe there are a few basic tools every investor should use as part of their investing process.

I know there are a lot of tools already out there, and yeah I'm not into re-inventing the wheel. We are mostly building skills and hope to improve on existing services, and maybe find a niche to specialise in."

6,2016-09-06,PM_YOUR_STOCK_PITCH,10,Just started on a finance degree. Looking for advice,"Okay guys I'm looking for some advice here. I just started on a finance degree. I've always had this idea of pursuing a career in asset management or equity research but am also very intriqued by the idea of starting something on my own or joining a startup company. And I'm having a really hard deciding which road to follow. I do however have this feeling that I'm a decade or two late for the investing business as a non-STEM ph.d? I keep hearing this talk about the luck/skill paradox which roughly states that as all participants get extremely skillful (and they do since the newbies go passive), luck becomes a greater part of your results. On top of that, it seems like computers are taking over and will in a not too distant future probably even put fundamental analysts out of business. So, if you had to start over now on a new career, would you choose investing again or would you pursue a career in a field like (fintech) startups/entrepreneurship, corporate finance, consultancy or the like? And why?"

11,2016-11-15,hannibaldon,5,Investing platforms for non-US/European investors,"Hi,
Does anyone here have any resources on investing and investing platforms for residents of countries outside the US/Europe. 

For example, a typical citizen &amp; resident of a country like Jamaica, Kenya, Nepal, etc cannot invest through Robinhood and other ""cool"" platforms. Said person cannot access the wealth of Roboadvisors and all the other fintech platforms like Prosper, LendingClub etc.. Most of these people must invest through Interactive Brokers, or their local brokerage.

What technologies and platforms are out there for these people (other than IB)? I'm talking about brokerages, crowdsourced lending, roboadvisors, online banking, etc."
