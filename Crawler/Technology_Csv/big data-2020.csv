I understand you can't time the market exactly (sell at the highest, buy at the lowest or vice versa if shorting..), but you seldom need to do that. I suspect you just need to be aware of pending changes, plenty of historical and recent data can point you to shifting global local economic conditions, you just need to be aware of these. Sure sometimes you may be off by  a large amount of time like   [Michael Burry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Burry)  in the Big short .. but then eventually the trend manifests itself..

2,2020-01-24,fact_seeker,1,"Article comparing value vs growth, large vs mid vs small-cap funds","This is a slightly dated but helpful article on value versus growth investing:  [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/value-investing-vs-growth-investing](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/value-investing-vs-growth-investing) 

The article compares value versus growth portfolios in different asset classes from 1990-2015.  As a relatively inexperienced investor, it has always felt like growth funds were the way to go and that it was a waste to put money into value funds. That article shows that value funds performed noticeably better than growth funds over that period. As I said, the article is about 5 years old, so I suspect the results would slightly favor growth funds if rewritten today. Ironically, the article states that perhaps you should tilt toward value funds, which would be poor advice for the last five years!

Some takeaways from someone who is still learning a lot:

1. While growth funds may seem like the way to go now, value funds frequently outperform growth funds. So unsurprisingly, it's a good idea to have a blend that captures the overall performance of the market.
2. The volatility (fluctuations in price) are dramatically greater for growth funds, so you probably need to be a bit more comfortable with big changes to focus on growth funds.
3. The volatility of mid-cap and small-cap funds tends to be higher than their large-cap counterparts.
4. Mid-cap and small-cap funds often outperform their large-cap counterparts. (This is surprising to me because we talk so much about companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc.) However, large-caps seem to have dominated overall the past 5 years or so.

I'm sure this is all pretty basic stuff for the experienced investor, but it was refreshing for me as a novice to see some real data confirming the statements that are frequently made in r/investing."
3,2020-01-24,HealthyReview,1,Question about an automated trading strategy?,"First up, excuse my gross ignorance. I am very new to the entire idea of investing and trading in general. I had an idea that is so overly-simplistic there's no way it would actually work. However, I'm not experienced/knowledgable enough to know why. 

I was looking at stocks like TSLA and SHOP and wondering what would happen if I just set a trading program to buy at open everyday and auto sell at +2$, reinvested the proceeds, then did this every day for a year. If there wasn't a +2, sell at close, then buy at open and try again. 

Here are the results (SHOP): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAjyjWQYbFU1n-fT\_cs2EDFfydrqvEL1NomF5Wa7WhI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kAjyjWQYbFU1n-fT_cs2EDFfydrqvEL1NomF5Wa7WhI/edit?usp=sharing)

(TSLA): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SRrg6Cv5vFfdLBPsI8mPhLh3snvbWdIy3w\_vmGDaDTs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SRrg6Cv5vFfdLBPsI8mPhLh3snvbWdIy3w_vmGDaDTs/edit?usp=sharing)

It seems like you want a stock between 200-600 dollars to have enough shares to actually make any traction. 

Also, before you mention it, this formula doesn't correct for some really BIG factors like partial shares or days where the high doesn't allow for a +2 spread. However, after looking at the data, there aren't many days where a +2 threshold wouldn't be auto-filled by the software. 

Also, I didn't account for taxes and fees (obviously that's huge) 

Regardless, what else am I missing? Surely it can't be this easy to see reasonable returns like this? Again, I apologize for my inexperience. I'm just trying to learn a thing or two."

I posed two different models in the last 6 years that I'm continually revisiting and updating based on new data that's available to me.

Here's the first one below from 6 years ago where I attached a $450 price target by end of 2018
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k15cb/my_model_of_tsla_through_2013/?st=k5h2987i&amp;sh=78a9694b

Here's the second one I posted a year later with a price target of $800 by end of 2020
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yn1kx/my_revised_model_of_tesla_tsla_by_2023/?st=k5h26rti&amp;sh=43f78d64

It appears that my models are running roughly a year behind of where my assumptions are ending up, so I figured I'd share my latest model for your viewing and entertainment pleasure.

In no way am I trying to insinuate that my models are somehow predicting where Tesla's price is going to end up - I'm simply sharing my thought process with you fine folks in the investing community to gather feedback and understand different points of view.

See below model:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUPfQhpFfax8lYC4iyvYT-gD_i9LIRkngFB_o6MZXA8/edit?usp=sharing

My broad assumptions:

* There will be a 90,000,000 global new vehicle market in 2028
* Roughly 50% of those sales will be electric
* Tesla will capture 17% of the EV market which is roughly 7.6 million cars a year
* I'm assuming a new vehicle introduced in 2025 that will capture the truly affordable car market that will be designed in China and released for worldwide consumption (average of $20k per car without autonomous features). This is called Cybercar in the model
* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025
* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin
* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY
* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network
* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto
* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028
* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028

That covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.

The price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.

Let me know your thoughts."
6,2020-01-13,shane_stockflare,1,Who could buy Twitter?,"On the [Pivot](https://podcasts.apple.com/br/podcast/pivot-with-kara-swisher-and-scott-galloway/id1073226719?l=en) podcast last week, Kara Swisher said that a several people are running the numbers on Twitter. The thesis is pretty simple. Twitter has a massive audience but hasn't turned it into $$$, so someone else could buy it, and make a better go of it.

[Comscore](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings?country=US) data shows Twitter getting approximately half the audience of Google or Facebook. [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) shows the same. So: comparing the stats:

||Market Cap|US users (Comscore)|Revenue: last 12 months|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Twitter|$25bn|156m|$3.4bn|
|Google|$986bn|257m|$155bn|
|Facebook|$622bn|219m|$67bn|
|Snap|$24bn|111m|$1.5bn|

If it does get acquired, no doubt the buyer will be obvious with hindsight. So to jump the gun, let's consider who's big enough to pay a 30% premium and not trash their own valuation or debt levels. 

Here's my short list, and I've included Snap, to show it is unlikely but still possible:

&amp;#x200B;

||Market Cap|Profit|PE ratio|Cash/Debt|EV/Net Debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Apple|$1,360bn|$56bn|24x|$8bn cash|n/a|
|Microsoft|$1,231bn|$41bn|31x|$59bn cash|n/a|
|Amazon|$936bn|$10bn|92x|$4bn cash|n/a|
|AT&amp;T|$279bn|$25bn|11x|$159bn debt|2.6x|
|Disney|$260bn|$10bn|27x|$42bn debt|2.6x|
|Verizon|$245bn|$20bn|13x|$107bn debt|2.2x|
|Comcast|$205bn|$14bn|15x|$103bn debt|3.1x|
|Netflix|$146bn|$2bn|100x|$8bn debt|0.7x|
|Charter Comm.|$109bn|$2bn|75x|$74bn debt|4.6x|
|Softbank|$93bn|$9bn|12x|$125bn debt|4.8x|
|Sony|$91bn|$5bn|19x|$12bn cash|n/a|
|Snap :)|$24bn|\-ve|n/a|$1bn cash|n/a|

A $30% premium would value Twitter at $32bn. Assuming an all cash deal, financed by debt at 5% this would cost $1.5bn a year. Compared to Twitter's net income of $1bn, it would almost be cash-break even.

In the case of cash positive companies like **Apple** and **Microsoft** it might even be accretive, as their cash piles are unlikely to be generating much income. For others with cash, **Amazon** and **Sony**, it's hard to see it having much of an impact to the PE ratio.

For the debt heavy firms, it would probably be too much for **Charter** and **Softbank** who are already nearing 5x leverage. **AT&amp;T, Verizon** and **Disney** could do a deal without much damage to their balance sheets or impact to their PE ratio. **Comcast** is somewhere in-between.

Which leaves the two most interesting options:

* **Netflix** would see its net debt ramps to $40bn and it's leverage ratio get to 3.5x. Uncomfortable but manageable. Given the strategy, and the high price of their stock at 100x, it would probably make sense to part pay in shares.
* **Snap** just doesn't have the access to $32bn of debt. Even if the purchase was self-financing, using Twitter's cashflow, it's hard to see what lenders would underwrite such a deal. So, again, part equity would be a key way to get this deal across the line. But that's unlikely to be enough. I'd guess a PE firm would need to pony up a $5-10bn part of the equity. And yes, bankers are imaginative folks, and PE folks are awash with cash.

Love to hear everyone's views. 

Thanks in advance."

Jan 8th, 2020

**2019  was a pivotal year in the psychedelic industry with US  decriminalization actions, two companies receiving FDA breakthrough  status for psilocybin, funding of the $16M Johns Hopkins Psychedelic  Research Center, The US Defence Department starting their rumored $20M+  Focused Pharma psychedelic science program and the movement of top  universities into research and clinical trials. With the explosion of  the more than $100M dollars worth of investable psychedelic  opportunities in Q3 2019, the collapse of high quality cannabis  investments, one of the best decembers on record and a potential $1B  scale psychedelic IPO - 2020 will be the year of psychedelic investment.**

The  movement in the field recently is just a blip compared to what is to  come, this industry has been brewing for the last few decades. Big  Pharma has failed when it comes to new approaches to brain and central  nervous system treatment. Neuro drugs have half the success rate of all  Pharma projects, which caused most of the big players to liquidate their  neuro programs in the last decade. Recently, engagement is exploding  with new clinical legislature supporting neuro, the recent approval of **3** potentially blockbuster neuro drugs in the last **2 years**, **Q2 2019** saw a record of over **$320M**  in investment into neuro drug development. Interestingly enough an  influential group of ultra-high net worth individuals to funded the  psychedelic holding company **Atai Lifesciences** which went on to fund **Compass Pathways** and continues to fund commercial efforts in this field. **Atai Lifesciences**  recent movements are a familiar story of acquisition and consolidation  in an emerging market which will be a common theme in the future of the  psychedelic industry. The collapse of investable cannabis opportunities  are driving investors comfortable in stigmatized industries and binary  risk to the table with big pharma, cutting edge science and huge unmet  market needs to create a perfect storm of opportunity.

**How big is the Psychedelic Industry?**

Historically, the psychedelic industry has been fragmented with around **$60M** worth of companies in the last **20** years, many of which were not sustainable. The current industry is around **$300M** worth of investments, dominated by the Peter Thiel backed **Atia Lifesciences** at **$100M+** and **Compass Pathways** at **$50M+**, followed by **Mind Medicine** at **$10M+,** **Fieldtrip Ventures** at **$10M+** and then a **10-15** early companies in the range of **$2.5-10M** each. The **$300M** worth of investable deals have only existed since the public formation of **Compass Pathways** in **2016**, with the majority leaving stealth mode in **2019**.

**Emerging Players** \- There are a number of emerging players, around **$25M+** in emerging deals in **Q3 2019** which have not passed due diligence.

**Clinical:**

Recent data is showing psychedelics can be real mega blockbuster neuro drugs. **Johns Hopkins** recent trial on Psilocybin for smoking cessation showed an **80%**  success rate in terminating nicotine addiction, more than double any  known therapeutic approach, including nicotine replacement therapy.  Academic data shows that Ibogaine is **95%** successful in terminating acute opioid withdrawal/addiction. Limited data from Ibogaine for opioid addiction trials show **50%** success rates in terminating addiction, more than **10X** higher than the generous **5%** success rate of other approaches. Data from leading Ibogaine providers like **Universal Ibogaine** show that this **50%** figure can be pushed closer to **75%** with proper protocols and aftercare. Clinical trials on Psilocybin for cocaine/crack addiction are ongoing at the **University of Alabama at Birmingham**, a **top 20** medical research university. **10** patients were un-blinded for bioethics review and the unpublished data shows that **30%** never touched cocaine again while the other **70%** had a relapse or two and turned their lives around, showing a **100%**  success rate in changing lives with minimal cost. When this data is  available publicly in the next years, tidal waves of interest will move  into the field.

**Projections:**

As a recreational market, **0.1%** of the population was surveyed as using psychedelics in the last month, placing the current black market at **$19.1B** while as a comparable percentage of the legal cannabis market adjusted for prevalence would place it at **$8B.**

As a medical market, the **$373B**  neurogenics market seems to be the addressable market. Penetration into  any indication in the neurogenics market would reap vast rewards,  Psilocybin is on track to compete in the depression market with two **FDA** breakthrough designations, a **2%** penetration into the depression market would being **$1.4B** in value. Ibogaines very reasonable projected **4%** penetration into the opioid dependence market will bring **$9.6B** in value yearly to groups like **Universal Ibogaine**  which are deploying clinical infrastructure, supporting clinical trials  and controlling the Ibogaine supply chain. Of all of the indications in  current psychedelic clinical trials, not considering crossover, they  address a **$400B+** market, with projected penetrations across each indication and adjustments for market factors, it is projected **$16B+** of value yearly will be created from commercialization of current late stage clinical trials.

**Challenges:**

Regulatory Challenges:

While nearly **100 cities**  are creating legislation to decriminalize psychedelics and multiple US  jurisdictions have passed decriminalization, federal changes will be  required to open legal markets to the full potential. While investing in  the binary risk of regulatory changes is standard in the junior  markets, current regulatory controls are preventing early revenues. Many  Canadian companies building production and distribution infrastructure  offshore in jurisdictions such as Jamaica are operating in a legal grey  area. While it is legal in Jamaica, any benefit or advantage given to a  Canadian company could be considered a proceed of crime including IP  development, capital repatriation and validation of technology offshore.  **Section 56 exemptions** from **Health Canada**  are required for Canadian companies working with psychedelics offshore  and companies which are raising investment dollars without a secured **Section 56 exemption** may be incurring legal risk.

Cardiac Liability:

The  unspoken elephant in the room of psychedelic derived pharmaceutical  acceptance is not regulation, for example Ketamine is a scheduled drug  which was recently approved. The problem is actually the liability of  bringing a seratonergic based drug to the market like Psilocybin, DMT  and LSD. The crippling withdrawal of blockbuster drug **Fen-Phen** and issues with other drugs like **Imitrex** due to seratonin agonist effects on the heart have scared the **FDA**  into a position that any seratonergic drug will require extreme  cooperation and diligence and will absolutely incur additional clinical  and monitoring costs over other drugs. Psilocybin while technically  hitting the 5ht2b receptor which causes cardiac side effects, does not  have a high enough affinity to be a deal-breaker, meanwhile LSD having a  very high affinity will cause large barriers for groups attempting to  bring microdosed LSD to the market. Ibogaine suffers from cardiac  liability due to an entirely different mechanism and unlike Psilocybin  or LSD, adverse events have been reported. While Methadone and other  standards of care also have the same long-QT cardiac liability at much  higher rates and significantly higher mortality rates , Ibogaine  clinical models must pre-screen patients for existing heart defects  before procedures to guarantee no adverse side effects.

Banking/Insurance/Exchange Issues:

Legitimate  psychedelic derived drug development companies have already had bank  accounts halted at multiple banks for involvement in this industry and  moving forward similar challenges faced by the cannabis industry should  be expected. Exchanges and public offerings will have logistic  challenges with this industry and minor friction has already been seen  in the listing process. DNO insurance and other underwriting will be  required to list in large markets and to date no psychedelic company has  been underwritten, although underwriters and leading insurance brokers  are actively exploring his industry.

Reimbursement:

The real  whale will be insurance and single payer reimbursement of psychedelic  derived pharmaceuticals on the market, allowing for global market  uptake. Health systems have traditionally been decades behind the state  of the art as seen in the point of care and home diagnostic device  market, a market which could keep people healthy at minimal cost but has  been crippled by lack of reimbursement.

Supply Chain Commoditization:

The  production and control of psychedelic supply chains which is the  familiar play of the cannabis industry will be a race to the bottom with  magic mushrooms and other psychedelics. Production models are competing  with a much more fluid black market and are being cannibalized by low  cost home production and wildcrafting of psilocybin mushrooms. The LSD  or ergoloid supply chain is highly monopolized, with the majority of the  worlds ergoloids being produced in a single location.Companies  competing in the production and supply chain space will face heavy price  pressure and a highly coupled global regulatory system. The single  outlier is Ibogaine, with a current global use estimated around **90kg**, expected to reach **280kg**  in the next two years, this is a commodity whose price will drive  through the roof. Large ibogaine producers have stopped production and  natural sources are not commercially viable, with an Iboga plant  producing maybe a single dose on the **10 year** period, the move of ibogaine to endangered status in **2019**  and no synthetic GMP producers - the ibogaine market is legal in the  majority of the world and exploding while highly underserved and  fragmented.

Delivery System Challenges:

A number of recent  psychedelic deals are built around new drug delivery systems for  psychedelics entering the recreational market to build expertise and  infrastructure ready to move into the pharmaceutical market. Many of  these technological approaches will not translate from the recreational  market to the pharmaceutical market such as CBD/psychedelic  compositions, natural product compositions as well as vaporizer and  inhaler based delivery systems. While **20%+** of all new  FDA drug entities are derived from natural products, natural product  mixtures containing many products and a controlled substance have never  and will never be FDA approved due to the regulatory system. Companies  developing Psilocybin/CBD combinations and related therapeutics for the  recreational market should understand that unlike the cannabis market,  recreational approaches will not translate directly to medical  approaches.

**Opportunities**:

Syndicated Investments:

One of the largest opportunities in any emerging market is syndicated investment, a **2002** analysis of **584** venture backed exits showed that syndicated investments produced **double**  the rate of return of non-syndicated investments. Psychedelic research  and development companies require standardized infrastructure that can  be leveraged across a number of players. The big players entering the  industry are more interested in empire building, requiring massive  consolidations of commercial efforts which can be facilitated by  syndicated investment groups. Companies like **ThinkMyco**, **Entheogen Biosciences** and **Cybin Corporation**  which focus on technology development, IP Portfolios and early stage  drug discovery will benefit the most from syndicated investment and  collaboration. A Harvard Business School review of **Pharma**  discovery programs statistically compared drug discovery programs to  weapons research programs and found in these high reward/low incremental  cost programs the optimal path is to run parallel programs, with an  average Pharma drug discovery program having **16** parallel programs, **10** core and **6** low budget/high risk.

IP Portfolio Development:

IP  development is the highest value for dollar on the investment value  chain and the psychedelic industry will be a totally IP driven industry.  The most valuable patent portfolios will include new psychedelic  compositions and therapeutic mechanisms, which require significant  investments into fundamental R+D, while less competitive portfolios will  include delivery system/psychedelic combinations.A recent review of  patents related to psychedelics shows many hundreds of patents for  psychedelic derived therapeutics with only a small cross-section being  commercially competitive. **DemeRX**, the **$40M+** Ibogaine research company holds **65+** patents in the ibogaine therapeutic area. While **DemeRX**  filed for bankruptcy and their research and development assets were  liquidated, it is rumored they have been injected with enough capital to  come back to the party - this is a dark horse to keep an eye out for.

Mushroom/Protein Connection:

The  real opportunity in magic mushroom production models is flying under  the radar: protein production. Mushrooms are one of the highest quality  sources of nutrition and protein, if you took a vitamin C supplement you  can live exclusively off mushrooms. Dried mushrooms have basically the  same protein percentage as beef and in terms of grams of protein per  acre per year are **100 fold** higher producers and much  more sustainable than traditional agricultural practices. Companies in  this space which invest into real R+D for lower cost mushroom production  will get a lift from the **$1.8 trillion** dollar protein market. A recent review of mid-sized mushroom farms shows that **50%+**  of the cost of mushroom production is due to labor and technical  inefficiencies. If energy, labor and materials cost drivers can be  reduced, and the cost of growing a pound of mushrooms can drop from  around **$2** to around **$1.20** through  automation, mushroom protein becomes significantly more competitive than  many of the industry leaders in plant based protein like pea protein.  If energy cost reductions can drop the cost even further, mushrooms will  become a disruptive food source. Psychedelic companies building  mushroom production infrastructure will be well served to remember that  by investing in automation, new technology and new growing systems the  price of mushroom based protein production can make it more competitive  than any other food source. The largest food security report in history  was released **Q2 2019** and showed that without subsidies a hamburger would cost more than **30$** and the meat industry will economically collapse by **2040**, the protein game is looking more and more attractive as a hedge against the regulatory risk of magic mushroom production.

China:

China  is one of the most advanced markets in terms of size and pharma  spending, as well as venture investment. Traditionally the Asian  cultures had no interest in marginalized and politically tense areas  such as drug medicalization but the movement into CBD and China's rabid  interest in plant medicines may create a large influx of Asian capital  moving into psychedelics. This industry shifting action will be  leveraged by education and the court of public opinion. A dialog must be  created showing psilocybin as a plant medicine and not a drug of abuse.  Interestingly enough, Chinese firms have very recently started  producing magic mushrooms industrially and importing them into the  Canadian market where they are sold into the black market  over-the-counter in some Canadian herbalist stores.

Ibogaine:

Ibogaine  is the only psychedelic model which will not be very quickly  commoditized. Ibogaine as a solution to the opioid problem is a  disruptive technology, with the rise of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs  like carfentanil dominating global supply chains, Buprenorphine, the  preferred standard of care is no longer effective. This is due to the  aggressive affinity of fentanyl to receptors, the lack of tolerance  ceiling and the little understood metabolism of next-generation fentanyl  analogues, dramatically compounding a problem already at pandemic  levels. Ibogaine supply chains have collapsed at the same time that  demand is growing exponentially, the firm which dominates the current  global ibogaine supply chain will reap around **$1.4M/mo profit** serving the current global demand. One of the largest African Ibogaine brokers has seen a **30x** increase in sales from **2017** to **2019**. With **Universal Ibogaine** taking Ibogaine through the Canadian clinical process and the grassroots support from **Health Canada**,  Ibogaine will be the first psychedelic approach available to consumers.  While Ibogaine is a scheduled drug in the US and some European  jurisdictions, it is not scheduled in Canada and the majority of the  global market. Multiple Ibogaine documentaries are in filming, including  actors such as **Johnny Depp**, as this is an education driven industry, we should expect exponential growth to accelerate in **2020**.

Support Industries:

Industries  supporting the growth of psychedelics will be a large part of the  future landscape as was seen in the cannabis sector. A psychedelic  business support network including education, conferences, business  analysis and financing have already cropped up commercially. In **Q3 2019** the renowned **Cambridge House International Extraordinary Future**  conference created a panel for psychedelic opportunities. Two weeks  before the conference there was a frantic rush and the majority of  relevant psychedelic players were represented last minute in the panel  discussion including: **Compass Pathways, FieldTrip Ventures, Mind Medicine, Johns Hopkins, Dennis McKenna and ThinkMyco**.  Multiple psychedelic investment funds are forming alongside of industry  press, consulting groups and other support interests. In **Q3 2019**, **Dr. Matthew Thompson of Johns Hopkins and Dr. Charles Nichols of LSU/Eleusis Benefit Corporation** helped organize the inaugural conference for the new journal called **International Society for Research on Psychedelics** in its home of **New Orleans**. Over **100**  international scientists from top universities were represented, with  the conference having to turn down many late registrations. **Dr. Rolland Griffiths**, head of the **Johns Hopkins Psychedelic Research Center** said ""This was the best scientific conference I have been to in my entire career."".

Sub-perceptual dosing:

Microdosing  was popularized by Silicon Valley, catalyzing the resurgence of the  psychedelic industry but microdosing is a protocol built on unsound  fundamentals. Research shows that the therapeutic effects of  psychedelics are highly dose dependant, higher doses lead to better  therapeutic effects. The microdosing supply chain model has excellent  returns, with a pound of mushrooms costing less than **5$/lb** to produce which provides around **1200x**  microdoses. When dosages increase past the perceptual threshold, the  potential for adverse events such as bad trips exponentially increases.  The ideal dosage seems to be just under perceptual threshold where you  can still go about your day, but much higher than a microdose. This is  industry standard with seratonergic pharmaceuticals, an example being  the diet drug **Belvique**, which is closely related to psilocybin, dosed at the perceptual threshold for maximum effectiveness. **Belvique** can cause psilocybin like hallucinations if **4**  tablets are taken as it is a seratonergic drug. High doses of  psilocybin require a clinical infrastructure and in-patient experience,  dramatically increasing costs and logistics overheads. Sub-perceptual  dosed pharmaceuticals will be available for out-patient and take home  treatment and in many cases may be as effective as full blown  psychedelic experiences. **Mind Medicine, ThinkMyco and Eleusis Benefit Corporation are leading the charge in sub-perceptual therapeutics.**

Next Generation Drug Development:

**Mind Medicine**  is taking the approach of engineering the hallucinations out of the  therapeutic experience by removing parts of the molecule and are moving  their drug, **18-MC** through the clinical process. This is  the ultimate high risk/high reward play in the psychedelic industry.  18-MC is modified which also changes a variety of important receptor  binding effects. The modified receptors include the receptors  responsible for growth factor release, cognitive effects, cardiac  effects and the opioid system coupled NMDA receptors. Since there is no  data on the human use of **18-MC** in opioid addicts, significant capital must be deployed before it is even known if **18-MC**  is as efficient as the parent molecule Ibogaine for treating opioid  addiction, the ability to treat addiction in an out-patient setting with  no cardiac toxicity - **18-MC** will be the megablockbuster all investors in the neurogenic space are waiting for. **ThinkMyco, Gilgamesh, Mind Medicine and Eleusis Benefit Corporation** are leading the field in next generation drug development.

Lateral Drug Development:

While psychedelics address a **$373B** neurogenics market, companies such as **Eleusis Benefit Corporation**  are showing they can address other unmet clinical needs such as chronic  inflammatory disease. Eleusis is developing new psychedelic compounds  for the treatment of inflammation, specifically within ophthalmology,  and has recently published Phase I trial results revealing the safety  and tolerability of low dose LSD in healthy older adults, with the  intention of evaluating low dose LSD as a disease modifying therapy in  Alzheimer's disease. **Eleusis Benefit Corporation** looks poised to cannibalize the **$3B**  steroid therapeutic market. Not yet published research is showing  Ibogaines potential as a therapeutic to treat sleep disorders. **Johns Hopkins** is currently reviewing the application of psychedelics in pulling patients from comas and vegetative states. The original pre-**Mind Medicine**  clinical trials on the Ibogaine derivative 18-MC showed promise in  treating Leishmania infection. BOL148, an inactive form of LSD,  originally the placebo in human clinical LSD research, was found to in  some cases to permanently terminate cluster headaches after a few doses  and is being publicly demanded from the cluster headache community.  These are the earliest days of understanding the application of  psychedelic derived chemistry as new therapeutic approaches.

Public Health Engagement:

Looking  at recently released data representing North American, working class  adults, methamphetamine and fentanyl use is growing enormously and  consistently. Linear regression of growth rates over the last **5 years** projects a **380%+** increase in Fentanyl usage the next **15 years**, with Methamphetamine projected at a **475%+** increase. This is concerning as there are more than a **million** high quality data points over **5 years** and an R2 value of **90%+**  which paints of picture of statistical certainty. This shows that the  opioid crisis has moved from a lift caused by supply side drivers to an  organically growing demand side driven pandemic fueled secondarily by  histories cheapest and most available synthetic drugs. With **$100B+**  in fines projected for the opioid crisis in the next few years, state  jurisdictions will shortly receive an enormous amount of cash that will  be legally obligated to flow into anti-addiction spending. Due to poor  outcomes and non-scalable approaches around advanced public health  programs, there will be a flurry of legislature to address how to spend  the **$100B+** anti-addiction warchest. Players like **Universal Ibogaine**  who have proven clinical models, can deploy infrastructure and  guarantee statistically better outcomes will receive unprecedented  amounts of non-dilutive government funding and will be the first to  benefit from **Decriminalization**/**Medicalization** in the **North American** **market**.  Players that can come to the table now at the state level and propose  medicalization legislature as well as profitable clinical infrastructure  with proven outcomes, could monopolize the entire **US market**. **FieldTrip Ventures** is developing Psilocybin clinical infrastructure while **Universal Ibogaine** is deploying proven clinical infrastructure already developed and proven by **Clear Sky Recovery**, the leading Ibogaine clinical experts with thousands of successful detox procedures and no critical adverse events.

**Closing:**

Like  any emerging industry, there are challenges and growing pains but the  blue-sky upside is unparalleled. ""Black swan events are characterized by  their extreme rarity, their severe impact, and the practice of  explaining widespread failure to predict them as simple folly in  hindsight."" Due to changes in public opinion, a mental health and  addiction pandemic as well as enormous movements of liquid cash, **this sector is poised to explode in 2020**."
9,2020-01-09,ichi-zero,1,"Big ""data"" is the new ""oil"" - Trend Investing","Here's a phrase I've heard ""Data is the new oil..and king"" - Partially correct.

""Data is the new CURRENCY and those with the most USEFUL data and ability to REFINE new data is KING"" -There you go - fixed. 

There are various types of ""data""

=&gt; Bulk ""data"" for data's sake (NSA Prism)

=&gt; ""processable data"" (Telemetry data collected from end-consumers)

=&gt; ""usable data"" (Filtered data w/ noise removed)

This conclusion I've arrived at is similar to John D. Rockefeller's during the age of OIL - he realized refining oil (processing data) is a more stable business than mining for oil (data). EVERYONE can mine data now, but it's mostly useless unless it's refined to show relevant data.

A better play for the future imo is data storage and AI that will be processing these mountains of data (e.g. Micron, Western Digital, Seagate, Microsoft, Google).

If you look at data creation projection for the next 5 years - it's unprecedented. Furthered by the age of digital content streaming and creation- Youtube, Netflix, Disney+, Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime TV.

Prime example: Google's Stadia is far from a flop - it was rushed to market just before Xmas not for sales - but for consumer awareness - and gives Google time to implement fixes and stabilize their game stream infrastructure just AS 5G/Wifi 6 is being rolled out and adopted - with significantly lower latency - comparable to a wired connection; the massive bandwidth increase is almost secondary.

Again, all this data - (cold storage, backup, fluid data, etc) all needs to be processed and storage SOMEHOW.

PS: All puns were refined and processed as intended."
10,2020-01-05,ka-cirt-bu-bo-fo,95,“The Man Who Solved the Market”: And the solution was… HMMs and regression,"I just finished reading Gregory Zuckerman’s biography of Jim Simons. The best answers I was able to get from the book on what their solution to the market was:

1. Markov chains, HMM models
2. Linear factor models, followed by high dimensional kernel regression methods
3. Big monolithic models and lots of data
4. A well orchestrated engineering effort

1 was the start of their bonds, commodities, and currencies team, and 2 was the start of their stocks team, and 3 &amp; 4 were guiding principles for both these teams.

Quantitative Bonds, commodities, and currencies team:

James Ax, a number theorist and strong believer in Markov Chains for financial markets was JS’s first quant, and headed the effort under the name Axcom in CA. By ’86 Axcom traded 21 different futures contracts. René Carmona then joined them to try to incorporate SDEs, his field of expertise. When that failed, Carmona suggested changing their existing linear regression approaches to be nonlinear, high dimensional kernel regression methods, and having the model directly suggest buy/sell orders. These improved results on trending models.
Elwyn Berlekamp (who had worked with Kelly) took over Axcom in ’89 and brings in Henry Laufer in ‘92, they worked on mean reversion strategies and looking at correlations between time periods. They start using data in 5 minute bars, used pairs trading, and had an online learner, constantly looking for trading signals (one auspicious one they called “Henry’s signal”). By ’97 “more than half of the trading signals Simons’s team was discovering were nonintuitive” and they ignored them. But they figured out the right day and time to make their trades. Later Simons says “we’re the best at estimating the cost of a trade.” In ’98 they are the majority of the firm, with stock trading only 10% of the profits.

Quantitative Stock team:

This team starts to make progress in ’93 when Nick Patterson contacts Brown and Mercer at IBM’s speech group (which uses algorithms like Baum-Welch in their HMMs for speech-to-text). Brown and Mercer take over Robert Frey’s factor stock trading fund named Kepler (later Nova). Frey (previously statistical arbitrage at Morgan Stanley) was identifying various independent variables for factor trading models. Brown &amp; Mercer retain Frey’s model, and elaborate it to cover real-life technicalities he was ignoring. They make an adaptive single trading system for their whole portfolio, and self-correcting for when the trades it suggests are unexecutable. The system repeated on loop several times an hour. It was a well engineered product, and usually bet on mean reversion strategies. By ’03 their profits are 2x Laufer’s team, and they work on a model to replace the futures team’s. Alexey Kononenko rises through the ranks of this team. Two members Belopolsky &amp; Volfbeyn bolt to Israel Englander’s Millennium management, allegedly with (millions of lines of) code and ideas, and have great success there (“some of the most successful traders Englander had encountered”). By 2010 the system is huge, executing thousands of simultaneous trades throughout the day, with lots of factors and interrelations.

Some thoughts:

HMMs, factor models, non-linear kernel regression, correlations between various time periods, these are all separately well known pieces. But the book says many times that a single model was handing out trading instructions. My first guess for how to put these different elements together would be that everything else was generating features for the HMM.

RenTech is having its best years right now! $63B of its $104B trading profits are since 2010, and with just 300 employees. Surely it has updated its techniques, and probably cashed in on the deep learning revolution raging since (at least) 2014!

11,2020-01-04,kiwimancy,8,Portfoliovisualizer added a robust (monte carlo sampling) efficient frontier forecast option,"See https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/efficient-frontier-forecast  

Must have been added within the last few months. The FAQ references A Practical Framework for Portfolio Choice
Richard O. Michaud (2003) ([link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2658642)). Should be easier to use than the black-litterman optimizer and more expressive than the risk parity and other optimizers.  

For context:  

Efficient frontier is a way of visualizing the return vs volatility for optimal portfolios. The standard way to do this is mean variance optimization (Markowitz). This gives an exact answer for a given set of parameters - the mean return of each asset, their volatilities, and the covariance of each pair. You can use historical data for this or your own predictions for the future. The big problem is that while this is optimal for the exact parameters specified, it tends to generate poor portfolios when the parameters have some error.  

Other optimization models try to generate portfolios that are suitable for a wider range of conditions. Black-Litterman uses a Bayesian model to regularize the portfolio weights. Risk parity and some others use fewer parameters that are more easily predicted and skips the ones that are difficult. This method uses Monte Carlo sampling to add noise to the parameters and then averages the resulting portfolios together."

Both because I want to truly invest in the whole market and not have a few massive companies really determine the fund (just one company like Apple having a bad quarter can tank a typical S&amp;P 500 fund), but also because I want to diversify, and I'm already heavily invested in many of those top ten companies.

*[Keep in mind the asymptomatic period was reported to be at most 27 days](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/) and [patients whom recovered are developing the coronavirus and testing positive again](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-reinfection-explainer/explainer-coronavirus-reappears-in-discharged-patients-raising-questions-in-containment-fight-idUSKCN20M124), which means public exposure in these countries could have begun weeks ago. By Monday, I estimate that there will be at least 2,000 total new cases in the above countries experiencing the new outbreaks alone.*


*Why does this matter? This weekend the Corona Virus news will be flowing steadily, thus IMO influencing the virus stocks to continue to rise on Monday and throughout next week.*

-

**Controlling the outbreak is going to become increasingly difficult.**


[To control the majority of viral outbreaks, for R0 of 2-5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1·5. For R0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30074-7/fulltext) 

[Researchers estimate the R0 value of COVID-19 to be likely between 4.7 and 6.6. Further, they speculate that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)


-

**The Case of Africa**

With the continent's [high volume of air traffic and trade between China](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0771-1) new outbreaks are inevitable.

Without treatment or vaccines, and without pre-existing immunity, sustained Corona Virus outbreaks might be devastating due to the multiple health challenges the continent already faces: rapid population growth and increased movement of people; existing endemic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria; remerging and emerging infectious pathogens such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa haemorrhagic fever, and others; and increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases.

[Governments are already anticipating demand and addressing supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30411-6/fulltext): large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents.

IMO, the market for the products of Corona Virus stocks will increase exponentially when new outbreaks begin in this continent. 

-

**The Stock Market**

Things are about to get way worse.

[The Harvard Business review predicts that the peak of the impact of Covid-19 on global supply chains will occur in mid-March, forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe. The activity of Chinese manufacturing plants has fallen in the past month and is expected to remain depressed for months.](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march)

Brace for a major effect on manufacturing worldwide. It will begin to hit full force in two to three weeks and could last for months. IMO, the only safe plays are plastic, Biotech, and Biopharmaceutical stocks. Liquidate your other positions now so you can buy back in lower.

As of 2/28. there are now 61 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the United States, according to an update today by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These include:

* 43 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship

* 3 people repatriated from China

* 15 US cases

[The 15 US cases include nine in California, one in Massachusetts, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois and one in Wisconsin. Among these cases, there are two instances of person-to-person transmission, one in Illinois and one in California. The latest case in California did not have any relevant travel history or known contact with another infected person, suggesting it could be the first instance of ""community spread"" of the virus in the United States, according to health officials.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/us-cases-coronavirus-community-transmission/index.html)

[The CDC aims to have *ALL* state and local health departments testing for coronavirus by end of next week.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/health/coronavirus-us-updates-california-patient/index.html) Word choice of all is interesting here, we already know that the CDC didn't have an ample supply of test kits and they were reported as inaccurate last week. If the were going to provide each state and local health departments with testing capabilities, this might be a signal that test kits developed in the private sector will be distributed.

-

**Looking Forward to Next Week**

IMO, the virus news this weekend will be off the charts. As new outbreaks occur and the sustained outbreaks continue, the demand for these corona virus stocks will rise. 

I still stand by the recommendation from my initial posting, in which I suggested investing into the companies producing test kits and personal protection / medical equipment. 

I am still currently holding $APT, $AHPI, and $CODX. No vaccine companies at the moment. I feel that there is a great deal of profit to be made swinging these stocks using 15 second candle chart &amp; the 50, 100, and 200 day moving average. Take a look at how the stock behaved the last two days and find a plan that can work for you. Watch the volume in premarket as well on the various virus stock to get a sense of where the interest is for that day.

My Portfolio Breakdown:

* 65.5% AHPI: On Friday AHPI reached a crazy premarket high of $67 a share. Upon market opening, price dropped steaply down to $16. Looks to be continuing along a trend line for now. The reason I increased my holding % here is because the float is considerably smaller than APT. https://imgur.com/u9BO2UY

* 6.3% APT: Similarly to AHPI, the price reached a big high premarket and corrected its self to the support from 2/27. https://imgur.com/orOnmri

* 28.2% CODX: Big swings here. Had been previously following the 50 day moving average and corrected down to the 200 day / trend line. Still waiting on FDA approval or PR from the company on order numbers. Will sell upon receiving FDA approval for their test kits. https://imgur.com/MTTw8Y1

1. Backtests done by the firm show that value investing beats growth stocks with high price-to-earnings ratios, and that “past winners” — how Shanbhag refers to momentum stocks — beat “past losers.” But according to Shanbhag, the evidence from these backtests defies common sense. Cheap value assets, he points out, are essentially the same as “past losers,” while momentum stocks are highly similar to growth assets. By Shanbhag’s logic, value can’t beat growth if “past winners” beat “past losers.”
2. “Investors can avoid being fooled by backtests by always keeping in mind that most attempts to beat markets will fail because trading is a zero-sum activity,”
3. “In this era of big data and cheap computing power, it is easy for anyone to create a winning investment strategy in a backtest,” he wrote. “But investing is forward-looking and markets are adept at pricing in known information.”

18,2020-02-10,Connorvo,1,Is $CHEF Spring Loading Earnings?,"# First Glance

At first glance, this looks like a classic case of [spring loading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spring_loading.asp) earnings. Their CFO, General Counsel, and Chief Human Resource Officer, all received stock grants on [February 2nd](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&amp;CIK=0001517175&amp;type=&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;start=0) this year instead of March (or May as is the case of last year) when they typically receive their grants.

\*Can’t post images, so linking to tables. See the grant dates table [here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1044/1*TzceYWWv3NaDgKVfWKM8Tw.png). See the article with images [here](https://medium.com/spring-loading/is-the-chefs-warehouse-chef-spring-loading-q1-earnings-f298643879bf).

You will also notice that their grants always came *after* their Q4 earnings call for those years (as it should). Then, all of a sudden, they granted the stock before earnings this year.

[Table image](https://miro.medium.com/max/866/1*luvgT6_47GKXfcLXd6_cUQ.png)

There is also some other interesting news that has happened over the last 6 months (thanks to [landhag69](https://www.reddit.com/user/landhag69) — nice name lol — on Reddit for pointing me towards some of this info).

* In November, they [raised $145 million](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/22/1951614/0/en/The-Chefs-Warehouse-Announces-Closing-of-1-875-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering.html). That money was used to buy [Sid Wainer and Son](http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-acquires-sid-wainer-son) (a curator and distributor of specialty food) on January 27th and [Cambridge Packing Company](http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-acquires-cambridge-packing-company) on February 3rd (the same day they reported their executive stock grants — though I don’t believe they were spring loading this announcement because that is just too close together). \* The stock is up 6.5% since February 3rd
* In November, Blackrock [announced](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2821864&amp;headline=CHEF-BlackRock-reports--passive-stake-in-Chefs-Warehouse) a 12.4% passive stake in $CHEF (which they just released an [update](https://www.streetinsider.com/SEC+Filings/Form++SC+13GA+++Chefs%26apos%3B+Warehouse%2C+Inc.+++++++++++++++Filed+by%3A+BlackRock+Inc./16412042.html) two days ago stating that this was actually a 12.9% stake)
* On January 15th, Conestoga Capital [announced](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163744/000108514620000197/chef_11520.htm) a 7.1% stake in $CHEF.
* They also released FY2020 guidance on January 14th which the market seemed to like (+1%).

The acquisitions of the two companies as well as the large investments by Conestoga and Blackrock suggest that there may be optimism surrounding the company. However, since this is already public news, it could already be baked into the stock price (and the 6.5% gain we have seen over the last week).

So apparently, the reason these grants were awarded is that they completed “ we find that this may all be easily explained.

# Deeper Look

As we dive into the [Form 4](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517175/000094787120000088/xslF345X03/ownership.xml), we see that the grants awarded were a result of “*shares delivered in connection with the vesting of performance-based restricted common stock award granted in 2017 pursuant to The Chefs’ Warehouse 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan based upon achievement of certain performance targets that were certified on February 3, 2020*"". The gist of the plan seems to be that they set aside 1.5 million shares (which at some point was increased to [1.75 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1517175/000151717519000003/chef-12282018x10k.htm) shares) to grant to executives and employees based on their performance. ***\*If anyone has more info on the plan. Please share!***

So apparently, the reason these grants were awarded is that they completed “*certain*” performance goals for a chunk of stock that was awarded in 2017. However, looking through the awards given out in 2017, I cannot find what this performance achievement was to make any decisions on whether or not this bodes well for upcoming earnings. If anyone finds anything, leave a comment!

# Conclusion

What starts out as a classic case of spring loading seems to transition into an easily explained case of employees hitting their performance goals. The only problem left is that we can’t figure out what goal they hit. If anyone finds the answer, please leave a comment with it! With that being said, the employees hitting their performance goal could be a good sign, but since we don’t know what that goal is, that is an incredibly murky position to take.

There are also quite a few more reasons why this isn’t a super strong case for spring loading:

* They had a decent 2019 (+13%) and just received some large investments, so they don’t seem like an obvious acquisition target
* There have been no big stock purchases made on the open market recently by any of the executives
* Only 3 of the 6 executives received a stock grant. Two of the executives that didn’t receive a grant are Chris and John Pappas, the co-founders of Chefs’ Warehouse. The other was the Chief Accounting Officer. The easy explanation here seems to be that neither Chris nor John received grants in 2017 (which is what just vested) and the Accounting Officer was not yet an executive in 2017!

19,2020-02-07,DontMicrowaveCats,1,Some specific details about impending supply chain disruptions throughout China which will likely cause some major ripples in coming weeks. (We won't even have scratched the surface of global economic effects until after the 10th.),"I of course cannot speak to anything definitive about the severity of the Wuhan coronavirus itself. In my own opinion from monitoring the situation over the past couple of weeks, I do believe the Chinese government is likely significantly downplaying the numbers...from sheer anecdotal evidence and their extreme reaction. But I also don't think this is an apocalyptic situation.

However, I do have fair reason suspect we haven't even touched the tip of market disruption on this thing. Just want to lay out some the facts specifically related to the supply chain for you to consider in your own decisions. I work with several clients in consumer packaged goods industries that have suppliers in China. I've been a party to the communications with their factories and fulfillment centers...so a lot of this has been verified from first-hand sources. 

Here are some current facts: 

1. Starting with the elementary obvious...China is the largest exporter in the world, accounting for nearly 15% of global export trade. Not just end goods, but a large percentage of their exports are intermediate goods, which manufacturers around the world rely on as inputs of production. If businesses cannot meet production needs from China, moving to another country is not always feasible if manufacturers  abroad cannot get access to affordable intermediate goods. 

2. China shuts down during Chinese New Year every year. Production grinds to a halt, and global businesses prepare for this slow-down well in advance - stocking inventory as needed. That is a big reason international companies have not been feeling a huge squeeze yet. However due to coronavirus, the CNY holiday has been extended until February 10th. Most businesses will resume operations on the 10th.  Already, many businesses relying on Chinese exports have been over-extended. 

3. According to reports from our suppliers, they and other factories are genuinely concerned that many workers will not actually return on the 10th following the holiday due to fears or travel restrictions. This could lead to some immediate medium to long-term reductions in production capacity. 

4. Commercial air travel to/from China has come to a near standstill, with 25,000 flights cancelled from Mainland China &amp; Hong Kong. 45% of Chinese air freight relies on excess cargo space on commercial airliners. As of now, there has still been enough capacity to meet the lower demand during CNY while factories are dormant. Come Feb 10th, factories fire back up...freight carriers are expecting some major bottlenecks. This will lead to increases in storage fees, and inevitable freight price hikes. (a backup source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-china-cutbacks-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-squeeze-freight-capacity-1158101567)

5. China's costs to import air freight from abroad (US/EU) have already skyrocketed by 3x - 4x in the last month due to decreased capacity. This is expected to lead to increases in manufacturing costs, increases in consumer goods costs, and reductions in retail sales.  A similar increase is expected on Chinese exports. 

6. Many of China's ocean ports have already seen significant slowdowns in sea carrier movement. Many sailings are being cancelled, and shipping capacity is expected to be reduced substantially. Again, they've been able to meet demand so far due to Chinese New Year slowing production.  But come February 10th, demand will increase substantially when factories kick back up. It is unclear if freight
https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-hits-shipping-as-china-port-traffic-slides-11580928711

7. Ports &amp; shipyards have same concerns about workers not being able to return - leading to further bottlenecks in fulfillment. If the virus continues to spread outside of Hubei within China, it its very possible some ports will be forced to shut down to regular commercial traffic.

8. Nobody knows how long this thing will go on for. It could continue to get worse, amplifying the above effects. Even if it does not get significantly worse, there is almost no logical way this will be completely contained within the next 2-4 weeks.

9. It is unclear if commercial freight companies will continue to operate at all through China if the virus is not contained. 

**TL:DR** Looking at the big picture, there is a long global domino chain connected to China's supply chains, and the first dominos have already began to fall. This is not conjecture or fear-mongering, theres plenty of data already showing it. Even if the virus was fully contained tomorrow...the effects of these first ripples will be felt for weeks/months.

 The dominos are only currently falling slowly due to CNY, which is why we haven't seen a huge burn yet.
But come Feb. 10th and beyond, the speed of market effects is going to be amplified. Only in the following weeks will businesses around the world be able to realize how their shipping costs, manufacturing costs, and end-product pricing structures are going to be effected. And only after that will they know how their sales will be effected. 

 China's exchanges are currently being propped up by large injection of capital from the Chinese government. This is a band-aid that could not help support the global market through an extended supply-chain slowdown. 

I'm not trying to be chicken little here, but these signals should be considered by all.

If you think I'm full of shit about the markets...but if you get no other takeaway, it would be wise to prepare for possible price hikes and/or shortages of many consumer goods in the coming months. At this point its unavoidable as far as I can see."
20,2020-02-06,81Gdummy,1,Tsla options and an interesting background story,"TSLA options

This is officially my first post to reddit. Long time reader, I also watch YouTube videos and don’t have an account so please forgive if my posting etiquette is off. Use to be a casual trader have a degree in economics with specialty in behavioral economics and minor in psychology. Also initially left college in my sophomore year (2010) to move to California and start a dispensary. I was going to McGill university in Montreal for those of you who don’t know of it(most Americans). FYI I am American myself and I’m Canada they call Harvard americas McGill (not bragging personally I still believe college is a tax on lower and middle class). I visited a friend on spring break and this is a time when a gram of weed would get you a night in jail and a misdemeanor and if you are lucky enough to live in Texas or Tennessee and be black either 1-10 in jail and at minimum they’d take your car or house or whatever expensive enclosed space you owned in which they found it or probably planted it. I could not believe what I was seeing when I went to see my friend (LA) and ultimately never returned from spring break. These were also the days when the laws in California were changing so fast that if you got a dispensary license in about 6 months you could sell the license for 10-100x what you paid for it (2k -7k if you used a lawyer or 500$ if you did all the paperwork yourself). I ended up starting the first 24hr delivery dispensary (legal) in California at that time probably the world. Needless to say it was very successful, after about a year I hired someone else to run the day to day and mostly became a semi professional gambler which many of you would consider yourselves. The difference is I was actually gambling in casinos. This is not a story in which I stupidly lose all my money at a craps table although there were some fear and loathing-esque weekends during this time that are noteworthy themselves. Also to note I decided to move with exactly 2$ to my name and my parents cutting me off because I was leaving college, luckily I also owned (or rather rented for free) a spot on my dear friends couch (who would later end up being an employee). Within 6 months I was worth about 50k within 12 I was making that much every week. This is the part where some of you may become disappointed because of all the interesting preamble that sounded like it was going to end in a crazy story where I used 50 lbs of weed to leverage a massive short on some stock because I had 24hrs to pay off the Armenian mafia or they would give me a Chinese haircut. Despite the fact that that did happen (with some minor liberties taken in the description although ones that make it actually less crazy of a story) it’s not what I am here writing about. I ended up starting my dispensary by winning 48k one night at the native casino near LA can’t remember the name but anyone from SoCal knows what it’s called. I was also a casual trader albeit very successful when I took it seriously. My dad is also a doctor so I essentially invested it all on ARNA before the fda approval of their new weight loss drug (at the time) I think it was called belviq. Anyway it was a killer, went from like 5 bucks to like 25 in a couple of days and I was looking good to start my business. Since then I’ve continued to dabble and did a lot of shorting but hated the risk, was unaware of options trading. After reading a couple articles online I started getting into it, fast forward to me studying economics (In which I didn’t learn much I didn’t already know except how to use programs to analyze massive amounts of data to find out trends that mostly my own intuition was good enough to tell me),  but now atleast I’m a “respectable person” in the eyes of my parents and the business world. Ultimately since this is my first post I decided to go big and long with it because I just felt that would be proper and maybe someone would be entertained, and maybe in the future I will divulge the actual crazy shit that happened but wall street bets doesn’t seem like the right thread (?). I just wanted to introduce myself and say, when TSLA hit 964 two days ago how many thousands of wallstreeters and tens of thousands of thousands or hundreds or however many of you redditors that are trading options and know half a twats worth what you’re doing did jizz their pants and buy some puts. Personally I like to gamble only saw it once it had dipped down to 900$ before closing but was trending down already. I figured I’d buy something that had a really short execution period for cheap af at like 895$ and once it dipped to like 865 or something sell but ultimately I knew in my heart as most of u do that it was going to drop to maybe 700 or lower. Didn’t have the liquidity to do what I would have liked but called some of the rich people I know who did and they wanted to jerk me off at 11 am the next morning. The few who missed out were begging for what next. One particular who is a relative of mine and a VP at major software company (think top 3) argued that wouldn’t everyone be buying puts and isn’t that what drove the price up? Wouldn’t it be better to sell options on the tsla shares you own and then if it goes down you made some cash and buy more at the lower price. I’m sure many of you know why that is a much weaker play and has way less upside and at the same time limits your risk way less. When the morning came he and others who didn’t follow thru were dying they missed out and asking me what to do next. I hadn’t looked much but it seemed to be bottoming out at 7 and I assumed put buyers were starting to executing their contracts so I said buy calls near 700 and do it for the shortest period u can find in terms of days. By lunch time it’s at 750$ ofcourse and my suggestion of 10-20 contracts would be betting a nice 80-90k maybe more if u bought the ridiculously short term options. Most of them were able to cash out my relative who is an exec at (insert top software company here) still missed out. He had to go into a meeting and didn’t have enough time to execute and wanted to die as he watched the stock jump 50$ and the imaginary dollars that would have been piling up in his investment account disappearing for the second time in one day for the levels he trades and wanted to buy this would have been around 1m maybe he would have made. After his meeting he messages me “uhh I think I need you to manage part of my portfolio, can you do the options trading for me and manage my short term stocks? I don’t have enough time to watch the market because of meetings etc. and when I see what I’m missing out on I can’t pay attentions during the meetings and it’s fucking up my productivity.” - me : “ well I don’t want to have access to your password etc. and be responsible if some fucked shit happens in your portfolio I don’t want to be blamed. Also if I don’t know how I feel about making you millions and then accepting whatever tip you feel is appropriate. Obviously we could do like a percentage but I’d feel better about starting a separate fund and you can put in whatever you feel comfortable investing and we can see how it goes. I Send the same message to everyone in my thread. Looks like I may have inadvertently started a hedge fund let’s see how it goes. Depending on the funding I will repost with proof."
21,2020-02-06,ireadit5times,1,Tin foil hat.,"I have this suspicion that the only way to make money in the stock market is to ride waves. Mid term length trades, that you just get lucky on. There are some you can see coming before the big rise, but once big money gets ahold of them, they manipulate the stock so much, through articles and analyst. 

Computer scientist create programs that collect data from apps like Yahoo finance, or even brokerage firms that sell your user data, and they take this information and combine it to create visualization, that represents shady trends. Such as how many individual investors are interested or invested in a particular stock and at what price point they got in at, armed with this information, they have easy tools to scoop the cream of the top whenever they feel it's right to do so... Costing individual investors billions. 

All's it takes are some creative algorithms for that data and lack of regulations, understanding by the public. It all feels so greasy. 

When I start to put in a hundred grand order in and I can just watch the stock creep up in real time, then activate the order and the stock plummets immediately after my purchases at a higher price it's the have and the have nots. At that point you just have to ride the wave and jump off when you feel you've made some$. But it's just so rigged. They have so many controls that affect different types of investors, and they pay billions for it. But the return is worth it. To be able to play psychological warfare on investors to just scoop money from their accounts, counting on psychology and shady tactics to just make us puppets with their fake articles and bullshit analysis of stocks they are interested in manipulating for a very specific reason. Maybe their charts show that an abnormal amount of individual investors have invested in a stock at a price that is high, they might know how much exactly they can take from them and how much fear it will take before they crack and sell, just so they can make that money and buy back in at lower cost... It's like taking money from a baby... The men behind the curtains... They steal from us all. But it sure is fun when we get over on them lol."

23,2020-03-29,richards_david,1,How long will the Covid-19 affect the markets? How should everyday investors react?,"Let’s see how the current environment looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are **some uncertainties** that govern investors’ reactions over the past 50 days:

* Nobody knows how long will the pandemic last. Obviously, the longer the worse and there is no indication of slowing down.
* Nobody knows if people who get sick will have immunity over the next potential virus wave.
* Nobody knows how the transition period back to normal economic activity will be achieved and how long it will take.
* Nobody can estimate the real economic damage to the backbone of the economy → SMEs
* Nobody can estimate the second derivative of the sell-off effects, i.e. what will happen with the fallen angels and lack of liquidity.

&amp;#x200B;

**A few facts about the virus:**

* Death rate varies between 0.5% – 7%, depending on population age, ICU coverage and extent of population testing.
* Most of the patients do not present symptoms for many days, which makes the virus extremely effective in spreading.
* No vaccine is expected before the next 12–16 months.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, a few economic facts and hard data:**

* Almost 50% of US corporate debt is BBB rated now and with most of the world’s population being under lock-down, it is no rocket science that big part of them will fall below investment grade.
* Almost 3.3M Americans filed for jobless claims last week. This is 5x the previous record of 1982.
* The Fed’s balance sheet just exceeded $5 trillion for the first time.
* Markets are deep into bear market territories.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Covid-19 effect:**

Now, it is important to clarify that Coronavirus will not disappear overnight. It will be a long and gradual process lasting 3–6 months. I am afraid the worse is yet to come for markets across the world. The detrimental effects in the real economy are becoming more obvious day by day and translated into spikes in unemployment, mortgage payment delays, lack of liquidity and financing for SMEs, cuts in Capex and supplies, and lastly corporate and personal defaults. This is a self-feeding loop probably leading to what economists describe as secular stagnation.

The Central Banks were not ready to face such a crisis. Rates were extremely low already and their balance sheets were already loaded with a lot of public and corporate debt. Another stimulus plan may be the only solution now, but it is not sustainable in the long run.

My opinion is that markets will remain into bearish territory for many months after the “end of Covid-19”.

&amp;#x200B;

**What can ordinary investors do to prepare?**

1. **You cannot time the market**. You never could and definitely cannot start now. So, instead of guessing whether stock markets are going to rise or fall further after Covid-19, adopt a longer horizon. Get some exposure in the stock market but do it for the long run. There is no point to pick the best mutual fund, as most of them underperform the markets. Go for a cheap ETF. Robinhood or Vanguard will probably do for most jurisdictions.
2. **Normal diversifiers** like corporate bonds are always necessary for an all-weather portfolio. However, keep in mind that in every liquidity crunch most of the risky assets move together and move downwards.
3. **Safe havens**, like government bonds (US, Germany, UK) still have their place in your portfolio.
4. **Look for market-neutral alternatives**. This can be alternative types of exposure, investment styles, methods, etc. Look for market-neutral assets and funds. At the toughest periods, the market-neutral investments will keep your portfolio beating. It is true that market-neutral exposure is not the easiest thing to achieve as an ordinary investor, but there are a few apps that try to achieve that. I find Daedalus Investment Platform interesting, but I am sure there will be others as well for jurisdictions not covered.
5. **Keep some cash**. Not only as a safe haven but to also exploit opportunities when you identify them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary**: These are hard times for the markets and events that are unprecedented for our generation. It is and will be tough, but the best we can do is be prepared both for the virus (social distancing &amp; healthy routine) and for our long-run financial plan."
24,2020-03-27,Manticorea,1,Would it be a good time to invest in REITs?,"With the majority of REITs taking a big hit this month, I believe some types of REITs will be good for long-term investment. Here is my argument. Please tell me what you think.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Commercial REITs are still very risky due to businesses shutting down, and perhaps being unable to make payment. This may mean commercial REITs will have a worse earning season than other types.

2. Mortgage REITs are at less of a risk because of the FED's willingness to go essentially to minus interest in order to insure steady cashflow. I know it is harder for banks to earn profit when interest gets low due to decreasing interest spread, and I assume the same would apply to mREITs, but still the recent drop is more than enough to make up for the lower interest. Since we might be entering another period of long recession, I don't think we have to worry about a big hike in interest rate in the near future.

3. REITs in retirement sector will continue to do well due to boomers retiring.  REITs in renewable energy and other clean technology will continue to do well regardless of the drop in oil prices. 

4. REITs in data storage sector will continue to do well, but has barely taken a hit. This means that with limited cash, investments in REITs in other sectors will yield higher returns at least in the short term.

5. One concern that I do have is if a particular REIT has high-yield bonds and other risky low-grade bonds that they will have to take a loss on if the pandemic gets worse. The FED will not be able to save all."
25,2020-03-26,correct_misnomer,3,Data Asymmetry,"Before I start I just want to clarify that this post is not about whether the market will go up or down. Instead I want to discuss why it is silly to think the average investor can predict volatile markets such as the one we are currently experiencing.

Big banks, hedge funds, institutional investors, etc., have a huge information advantage over the general public through their data aggregation. They are able to purchase large amounts of data for so many different scenarios. They are looking at data that many of us have not yet even considered relevant to the current situation. Many of them are already processing this information, understanding how it will effect the economy (with the help of people with actual degrees in economics), and updating their projections for market performance.

I’ve seen so many people on posts today frustrated and confused as to why the market is jumping after jobless claims were released. Most people calling it a bull trap already. However, as I see it, the average investor simply does not have any place in judging the current market behavior. The first step to investing is to assume you know nothing. For every idea you have, theres a 100 other people thinking the same thing, as seen by the sheer disappointment in this subreddit following the jump today.

In short, there exists a massive data asymmetry between the general public, and large trading firms. In some cases, where the data is not particular telling (lacking a strong signal), the public may be able to take advantage of speculation. But, in most cases, the information advantage that large firms have, leaves the public basically in the dark, regarding current market conditions."
26,2020-03-25,narworker2,1,"Why did Buffett overpay for Delta, and are the airlines going bankrupt?"," Link to original post here, which has some funny images too:  [http://theyieldblog.com/](http://theyieldblog.com/) 

Text only:

With airline stocks in precipitous decline and details of a bailout being hammered out this minute, I've spent the past two weeks trying to better understand the longer-term profitability (or lack thereof) of the airline industry. Warren Buffett, America's favorite ruthless grandfather, famously joked about the airline industry in 2008:  
*Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.*  
I like to describe airlines as a capacity-commodity industry: profitability of the industry rests primarily not on the growth of the underlying market (the demand for travel), but on limiting supply (in this case, the number of airplane seats in the air) to maintain pricing.  


We see this precarious dynamic across many capacity-commodity industries: companies carefully expand production capacity, wary of sparking build-out wars. Samsung, commenting most recently on their Q4 earnings call, would rationalize their expansion of NAND (the chip used in solid-state drives) capacity very carefully, trying not to scare competitors into believing there would be industry oversupply:  
*Regarding our investments going forward, the base that we are operating in is that the demand we're expecting, as we mentioned during the presentation, is around mid-10% growth for DRAM and mid to high-20% growth for NAND. Basically, our default is to meet the demand growth through process migration as well as using our inventory. Now to answer the hypothetical question that you posed about, for example, this year, demand going far over what's expected overall, then we will have the option, for example, to respond to market demand flexibly using Phase 2 of Pyeongtaek or Phase 2 of Xi'an, these new fabs, so that would be an option in that situation that you've proposed.*  
Notice what Samsung is actually saying here: ""We can meet some demand through process node migration (Moore's Law), and we did kind of overproduce last quarter, so we have these leftover NAND chips and we'll sell those too. Oh by the way, let's just address this hypothetical question you've asked, for which we've already spent $2.3bn USD, that if demand were higher, we would produce more. Hypothetically. Not saying we're doing it, even though the fab is already online, just that we're ready."" What's worse, SK Hynix (the other leading NAND manufacturer) says much of the same thing: ""We'll produce more...if there's more demand!"" The two companies try to maintain face in the market by signalling a somewhat cooperative environment, while simultaneously attempting to sneak away and grab a little bit of market share. Everyone is trying to cheat their way, just a little bit, to higher profitability. As Samsung and SK Hynix demonstrate, all capacity-commodity industries are really multi-billion dollar games of [""just the tip""](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Just%20the%20tip).  


Similar to the NAND industry, which consolidated from five major players to four after the implosion of Elpida, the merger of Continental Airlines with United Airlines in 2010, and the merger of US Airways with American, shrank airline the industry to three large players (United, American, and Delta), with four tiny players (JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and Virgin) resulting in route consolidation and highly-profitable small-airport destinations (i.e., a flight to Buffalo NY has a higher price-per-mile than a flight to Chicago).  


Buffett describes this industry consolidation and collusion in his typical bullshit-folksy way, after taking an 11% stake in Delta Airlines:  
*It’s true that the airlines had a bad 20th century. They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way, I hope.*  
I really hope to one day learn to communicate in the non-threatening way that Buffet does (Magic 8-Ball says: ""Outlook not so good.""): he manages to entirely elide the overwhelming tendency of oligopolies to engage in widespread price and capacity collusion.  


There are a bunch of subtle ways that airlines can collude to restrict capacity. One approach, as alluded to by Delta in what I can only describe as the greatest big-brain-energy play in the history of collusive behaviors is as follows:  
*We at Delta were the only airline back in 2012 that voluntarily capped our carbon footprint at 2012 levels.*  
This is an evil-genius-level play. Since emissions are primarily driven by fuel consumption and fuel efficiency, Delta is de-facto signalling capacity restriction by signalling carbon footprint restriction. These people are evil geniuses, for managing to combine eco-friendly virtue-signalling with industry collusion, all in one neat, tidy, totally legally defensible claim that probably can't be litigated against.  


Another (arguably) legally-defensible approach would be for all airlines to pledge 85% of their earnings to dividends: airlines that cut their dividend (in order to grow fleet size), would see their stock immediately punished (since their dividend was cut), and dividends of this magnitude would prevent fleets from growing, thereby enabling stable industry capacity and profitability. Dividends would have the added benefit of preventing poorly timed share repurchases: the fact that UAL and DAL have cut share repurchases exactly when their stocks are cheapest is all I need to say here.  


Unfortunately for shareholders, airline CEOs are generally paid in options (which don't pay a dividend), and therefore, airline CEOs have a tendency to favor share buybacks, which, if you recall from our article [""How to be a shitty investor""](http://theyieldblog.com/stonks), are only good in limited circumstances.  


The biggest driver of airline capacity however, is no longer fleet size, capital allocation decisions, or emissions, but airport landing and takeoff slots: the scheduled time a flight is allowed to arrive and depart at a specific hub. These slots are effectively ""timeshares"" in the literal sense, and are owned by a specific airline, while being sold/coordinated by airports.  


Most US airports are near-capacity, so for an airline to gain a foothold in a new hub, an existing airline must approve it. This obviously leads to incredibly profitable horse-trading shenanigans (the horses are airport slots): like collecting specific properties in Monopoly, airlines will trade slots until a duopoly of airlines control the slots at each airport. This game of Monopoly even has a name: ""hub premium"", the higher price that passengers tend to pay when an airline has consolidated a significant percentage of overall slots at a single airport.  


Hub premiums and slotting are the real reason Buffett loves airlines: in good times, they can no longer be their own worst enemy, and are limited in capacity expansion through limited airport slots, and can even gain extraordinary pricing power in hubs they control (some online whitepapers have shown that the hub premium can be as high as 10-20%, which is effectively the entire profitability of the industry).  


In 2000, the Wendel H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Air-21) attempted to curb this behavior and attempted to ensure that new entrants had ample access to airport facilities and slots, stating that ""major airports must be available on a reasonable basis to all air carriers wishing to serve those airports"".  


In order to encourage airports' cooperation in opening up airports to ""all air carriers wishing to serve those airports"", Congress made federal sources of funding contingent on compliance: blocking passenger facility fees (up to $4.50 per ticket) in government subsidies should an airport fail to comply. Note that these fees would go to the airport, not the airline, as obviously airlines would otherwise happily eat a $4.50 loss to reprice by an extra $100-$200.  


Unfortunately for consumers, this law only applies when an airport is responsible for ""over 0.25% of all enplanements"", which means that smaller US airports are incredibly profitable for incumbent carriers that have no requirement to give up their slots.  


Analysts ask about slots on conference calls, and you should notice from the following JetBlue earnings call how closed-lipped leadership is being here: no carrier wants to tip their hand on how negotiations are proceeding.  


Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research to JetBlue management:  
*...can you update us and where you are on obtaining slots?*

  
Stephen Priest, JetBlue CFO:  
*Again, I'll pick up the aircraft side of things. And then I'll get Joanna to give an update on the wider perspective with regard to slots. We remain confident in our plans to continue to grow relevance in both New York and Boston with the European expansion. Great amount of planning underway and again because of the close cooperation with Airbus we are confident with the delivery timeframes around the A321. So I'm going to Johanna to give a better perspective in terms of - our perspectives in terms of slots et cetera.*

  
Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue COO:  
*...We continue to work multiple paths around slots and a number of London area airports were confident that our London plans can work in any number of airports. And we'll update you when we have a bit more information to share.*

  
The New York Times has some interesting stories showing how incredibly hard it is to break into an airport for a marginal player:  
*Virgin, for instance, has found it difficult to expand in big airports controlled by its rivals. The carrier tried for three years to get into Chicago O’Hare International Airport, where United and American Airlines own most of the gates and would not part with them. Eventually, the airport bought a concourse once operated by Delta and opened it to new entrants, allowing Virgin to establish six flights a day between Chicago and San Francisco. “They weren’t interested in another competitor,” said David Cush, Virgin America’s president. But Virgin is still finding it hard to get landing slots at Newark Liberty International Airport, controlled by United. As part of its merger with Continental, United sold some landing and takeoff slots in a private sale to Southwest Airlines that left Virgin out of the loop. As a result, United is still the only airline to offer a direct route between Newark and San Francisco.*  
You'll also notice from that article that only marginal airlines like Virgin are willing to comment: slot control is so important to major players that their representatives generally avoid all comment.

Slots appear to be the most strategically important property of an airline: they inherently restrict airlines from competing each other to death. Buffett is right as usual: the first 100 years of airline growth were uncapped by airport slot constraints, which are now preventing airlines from becoming their own worst enemy. To the upside, I see an enormous opportunity for airlines to be far more shareholder-friendly by enacting aggressive capacity restraint through dividend signalling and carbon emission control. To the downside, airlines will continue to face more regulation: airlines touch a broad base of political constituents and their long-term profitability is fundamentally capped by consumer ire and regulatory oversight.

If you've ever wondered if antitrust regulation is truly helpful, consider this: Berkshire Hathaway has over $124bn in cash or T-bills, and without regulation Buffett could trivially acquire all five US airlines with no external financing, consolidating airport slotting across every airport and gaining monopolistic pricing (I can hear Warren's heavy breathing), and single-handedly float their working capital needs. With regulation, new entrants will be able to gain footholds and compete if pricing gets too far out of wack. Ultimately, the answer to the question of long-term US airline profitability rests almost exclusively on regulatory oversight: with peak travel demand in non-Corona times exceeding airport capacity, US airlines will be as profitable as they can get away with.  


**Are airline stocks worth owning, right now?**

The airline bailout memo paints the exact picture we would imagine:  
*Pessimistic: $26B (67%) net drop in liquidity for A4A passenger carriers alone in the first 6 months of 2020 to $12.8B. By end of 2020, they will have dropped $53B (135%) to a deficit of negative $14B. In this scenario, all seven of A4A passenger carriers run out of money completely sometime between June 30 and the end of the year. Making matters even more urgent, credit card companies would likely begin withholding cash from sales before the carriers actually run out of money, effectively causing carriers to run out of money earlier than June 30.*  
Credit card companies ""witholding payment"" to the major airlines is an absolutely blood-chilling statement. There really is no precedence for this situation: in 2009, Delta still served 188bn revenue passenger miles with 82% passenger load. At its peak in 2019, Delta will do 237bn revenue passenger miles. We have literally *never* seen a true decline in air travel in the US, not even from 9-11. However, we do have real data, from Chinese airlines, for this exact crisis!  


**China Southern Airlines March 18 Press Release:**  
*In February 2020, the Group actively responded to changes in market demand, timely adjusted its operation strategy, optimized its capacity allocation and reduced some flights. Passenger capacity (measured by available seat kilometres (“ASK”)) of the Group decreased by 73.07% as compared to the same period last year (a year-on-year (“YoY”) basis). Of which, passenger capacity for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 74.31%, 91.05% and 69.34%, respectively as compared to the same period last year. Compared to the same period last year, passenger traffic (measured by revenue passenger kilometres (“RPK”)) decreased by 85.11%. Of which, passenger traffic for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 85.95%, 95.92% and 82.69%, respectively as compared to the same period last year. The passenger load factor was 47.11%, representing a decrease of 38.11 percentage points as compared to the same period last year. Of which, the passenger load factor for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 38.77 percentage points, 41.86 percentage points and 36.92 percentage points, respectively, as compared to the same period last year.*  
Holy shit. This is awful. An 85% decline of revenue passenger kilometers for passenger flights. There is almost no way the US airlines get out of this without massive shareholder dilution in addition to loan guarantees. I am likely not a buyer at $20/share for Delta, the largest and best-run of the airlines.  


While Delta is better-positioned than United, **their working capital ""backdraft"" is simply too high**: flight refunds will absolutely devastate their liquidity. Delta had $47bn of annual revenues in 2019, so consider the possibility of Delta seeing $5bn-$20bn of pending refund requests (my wild-ass guess) while having only $2bn of cash for refunds, and $40bn of opex ($11bn of which is salaries, and $2bn of which are landing fees), the fixed costs of Delta still massively outweigh existing liquidity: I estimate the working capital suck to be so high that Delta and others may need a second bailout should this disaster last 18 months.  


Airlines are sort of like very fragile insurance companies or banks: they float/""lend"" an enormous amount of money ($50bn of revenues / $44bn opex for Delta) while being worth very little (Delta is valued at $13bn on the day of this writing). Airlines have been walking a very wobbly tightrope over the past 5 years, and falling off has meant a $50bn federal bailout, which vastly exceeds the amount the industry used to repurchase shares over the last 4 years. Airline profits should be tucked away for leaner times, but instead are wasted on overvalued shares, making their share price rise almost illusory.  


Ironically, the US Federal bailout's plan to block stock buybacks for US airlines should actually be great for investors in the long-run: were someone to buy shares today and hold until results normalized, airlines will be able to return cash to shareholders at incredibly high yields (as a percentage of cost basis). Delta prints $7/share in earnings in a peak year but pays only $1.50 in dividends. Post-bailout, we can imagine Delta's share count doubling (and share prices halving) from massive equity dilution. Imagine a world where Delta is forced to distribute $3.50 a share in dividends on after you paid only $5-$10 a share.  
One can only dream.  


I'm a buyer of post-bailout DAL at $8/share."
27,2020-03-24,coffee-trader,1,"Don't be misguided, markets bottom will be signalled by low VIX and actual economic data, not huge rallies","Today is pure optimism and the reaction to good news (or what looks like good news). Fiscal stimulus is anything but certain by tomorrow, FED is doing unlimited QE, and Trump thinks the US can open up by Easter.

Fiscal stimulus takes time to kick in and for many people and businesses comes a week too late. It helps putting money in the pockets but doesn't suddenly restart the economic apparatus -only consumer and investment confidence do that.

Unlimited QE is like fishing with dynamite: quick results but a lot of underlying damage. lts worth noting that this is not a financial crisis but a public health crisis with financial implications. The FED can at best alleviate some symptoms but that's it.

The US is not testing nearly as fast as Korea (17 times less tests per capita when I checked this weekend), nor is it taking the lockdown serious. Unless a million tests appear by this weekend so the virus can be traced and narrowed down, Trump has to face the reality that he either locks down fully now or blows this crisis out of imaginable proportions in less than a month by opening.

So in my opinion, how does a bottom look like? 20-30% drop from the current level, with decreasing volatility starting in one or two weeks when the spread of the virus becomes more clear and the economic data hits us hard. Shy but ever more common gains and then more big rallies than drops (but not 10% if that's what you want).

We've only had one VIX spike, in 2008 there were 3. Also plenty of examples of fake rallies like today's and the first Friday of the month. The sp500 was grossly overpriced in February, so whatever it fell until the first days of March was barely an overdue correction. Now you have to input recession to get the true dimension of the collapse.

This time the cuts are much bigger (13-15% cut for Mar quarter, 15-20% cut for Jun quarter) now that there is greater visibility to the supply chain disruptions in China for much of the Mar quarter, as well as the demand pressures in China for most of the Mar quarter spreading to the rest of the world starting late Feb.

Analyst checks on global smartphone shipment data indicate a 38% y/y decline for Feb, which is the largest decline ever. Expectation now is that the demand pressures will persist in North America (US \~45% of sales) and Europe (\~25% of sales) for most of the Jun quarter as China begins to slowly recover. While Macs and iPads should arguably do better than iPhones in this environment of learn/work from home, technology purchases in general are currently far from consumers' top of mind.

All the bad news near term aside, the long-term bull thesis for AAPL remains intact. AAPL has \~$100bn in net cash, generated \~$64b in free cash LTM, and has \~20x interest coverage ratio - it is as safe as any company can be in weathering this pandemic, not to mention its flexibility for buybacks. Since AAPL is expected to launch its 5G iPhones in the fall, it should be less hurt than other makers already on the market today. Prior to this crisis, AAPL was forecast to capture \~25% of the 5G handset market in 2020. Demand for AAPL devices should start to see a nice recovery in the fall."
29,2020-03-23,legoadan,1,(OC) Are leveraged ETF's really that bad?,"**Question:** If I plan on saving $100 every week, am I better off holding cash, SPY, or SPXL?

**Answer:** It's complicated, but either SPY or SPXL if you expect a bull market. (see pic)

https://i.imgur.com/bmKz2Vt.png

**Backup:** SPY is an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500. SPXL is an ETF that also tracks the S&amp;P 500, except it does so at 3x leverage. SPXL also has a much higher commission that SPY, which means that in times where the S&amp;P 500 is flat SPY holders will be flat while SPXL holders will be losing value.

I made a table and ran through many scenarios to see which option is actually better. I used the weekly historical data from Yahoo finance. I wasn't precise, but I went to about as far back as the start of the SPXL ETF. I made my model in Excel. I'll post a link in the comments.

For simplicity, the model assumes no commissions from a brokerage. It also doesn't take into account interest rates or inflation.

I did this to try and show that leveraged ETF's are not a horrible option for long-term investing, but with the huge caveat that the last 11 years have been a bull market and my data only covers the last 11 years. The commissions from the SPXL ETF do chip away at some profit, but as long as the market is steadily going up it's not enough to bring you down. That's a big if though.

**Some things to notice:** Anything that ends around now will show that cash is better. This makes sense since the market is at a huge low right now. Also, notice the streak around 2012 where Cash and SPY out-perform SPXL."

31,2020-03-20,Cuza,1,Staggering Rise in Jobless Claims This Week,"Article from The New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/19/upshot/coronavirus-jobless-claims-states.html?action=click&amp;module=Top+Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage


"" Numbers released on Thursday by the Labor Department — as well as a preliminary analysis of even more recent data — provide the first hard confirmation that the new coronavirus is bringing the United States economy to a shuddering halt. The government reported that the number of initial unemployment claims rose to 281,000 last week, a sharp rise from 211,000 the previous week. This rise in initial claims of 70,000 is larger than any week-to-week movement that occurred during (or since) the 2008 financial crisis.

But even these numbers understate the economy’s free fall, as they reflect the state of the economy last week. Based on preliminary news reports this week from 15 states, it’s already clear that initial claims will skyrocket next week, most likely to levels never seen before.

The numbers for the state of Washington, where the coronavirus pandemic took hold earlier and has had a severe impact, are particularly notable. There, jobless claims more than doubled last week, and are now at levels recorded during the depths of the last recession.

Washington is an especially relevant case study because it imposed containment measures — including the closing of schools and restaurants and a ban on large gatherings — a week or so ahead of many other states. It seems likely that other states’ labor markets will also follow Washington’s path.

Although Washington has not revealed the most recent official figures, state officials said that claims increased 150 percent last week and that the state was seeing an “even more dramatic increase this week.” They also mentioned that call volume surged more than eightfold on Tuesday.

As the accompanying charts show, jobless claims rose sharply in the vast majority of states. These figures come from state unemployment insurance offices tallying up the number of people newly applying for unemployment benefits.

This state-level data report is often ignored in normal times but is closely watched at economic turning points because it provides detail on what’s happening week by week, rather than each month or quarter. These figures are produced rapidly — providing hard numbers a mere six days later.

The big picture is clear: When we write the history of the coronavirus recession, we’ll say the downturn started in early March.

But don’t take these official numbers or the preliminary reports from individual states as providing precise signals: There are numerous anecdotal accounts of phone lines to unemployment offices that are jammed, offices that are closed, or websites that have crashed. The official data is on the number of claims filed, whereas the number eligible and attempting to file may be much larger. 

 The stark rise in jobless claims reflects the unusual nature of this recession. In a “normal” recession, the economy slows over a period of months, and joblessness rises over an even longer period as individual employers see the effect on their businesses. The resulting rise in initial unemployment claims tends to be spread over several months.

This is different. State government directives shut down many businesses, leading to an unusually rapid downturn. A rapid spike in jobless claims will also be an extremely large spike, as what would normally be a few months’ worth of job loss happens in a few weeks.

As you look at what’s going on in your state, keep in mind that these numbers reflect developments last week, but that in most states, the more draconian changes in economic life were imposed this week.

The last recession began in December 2007, but even half a year later, some economists were still debating whether the economy had entered a recession. This time, there’s no debate. ""


I have looked at the graphs and I've never seen anything like this, I am truly shocked, if we are to believe the data and extrapolate for other states we are at a greater unemployment percentage wise than the Great Recession right now"
32,2020-03-19,Starcraftduder,1,Incoming inflection point for general market decline: more studies are emerging showing that existing cheap and widely available treatments have high efficacy in treating covid19 patients,"Hi guys, I am back with some good news. Back in February 10th, 9 days before the market began its crash, I wrote a thesis about why an impending serious global economic downturn was inevitable unless two things happened: 1) immediate treatment is developed 2) vaccine developed by next flu season:

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/

&gt;So if my logic and assumptions are correct, we are looking at an inescapable catastrophe for the Asian tourism industry at the very least. Just in Time manufacturing keep about 2 weeks worth of parts. Most businesses already adjusted their supplies to account for the normal Chinese New Year shutdown. We are now coming up on the limits of most JIT supplies. So expect some pretty bad news to be coming out this week and especially by later this month. I'm seeing pretty big dips in the stock market by April. Probably -15% by April and up to -35% by the end of the year. This will be our ""dip"".

I also wrote a follow up literally a trading day before the oil war started between Russia and Saudi Arabia and prices went crashing that went into further details about what will be unfolding in the coming weeks/months. I detailed trouble for oil industry and oil communities, needed government policies (bailouts, stimulus, helicopter money to consumers), hidden losers like casinos (will be trading cents on the dollar) and private prisons, etc. All of this developed literally within days after the thread was posted.

This will be my third post in this series but it will be a brief post:

I believe that the market decline is quickly coming into sight because we have increasing evidence of efficacy of various widely available drugs in treating covid19.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/186Bel9RqfsmEx55FDum4xY_IlWSHnGbj/view

This is the latest peer review study showing that drugs like hydroxychloroquine has been shown to cure (test negative) 90% of patients after 6 days vs 96% still positive for virus after 6 days in the control group.

This builds on what we've seen reported in countries around the world:

- China just approved chloroquine, an old drug to treat malaria, as an effective treatment of nCov. https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjd.com.cn%2Fa%2F202002%2F17%2FWS5e4a436be4b00949486814d8.html&amp;sandbox=1

- ""It would be a medical mistake not to give chloroquine against the Chinese virus"" Didier Raoult, expertscape #1 expert on communicable diseases. https://www.20minutes.fr/sante/2727411-20200226-coronavirus-faute-medicale-donner-chloroquine-contre-virus-chinois-selon-professeur-didier-raoult

- Included in both the Chinese and Korean treatment recommendations https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32074550 http://m.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7428

- hydroxychloroquine seems to work too ""20 patients with new crown pneumonia as of February 17th. The clinical symptoms of patients with 1-2 days were improved significantly after treatment with hydroxychloroquine. After 5 days of use, 19 cases of chest CT showed significant improvement in absorption"" https://www.jqknews.com/news/388543-The_novel_coronavirus_pneumonia_has_short_term_curative_effect_on_the_treatment_of_new_crown_pneumonia.html

- earlier update on 21 Feb of 135 cases that generally got better http://www.china.org.cn/china/2020-02/22/content_75732846.htm

- One of the top french specialist on the subject announced that chloroquine might be the medicament we needed and results from the tests in china are amazing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L6ehRif-v8

So here's some info on what's happening:

Drugs like Chloroquine works in treating the virus because they are Zinc Ionophores. Zinc inhibits viral reproduction but zinc has a hard time making it past our cell walls. Zinc ionophores solves this problem and has been shown to work for other viral infections as well.

Data coming out of countries like China and South Korea shows that case fatality rates dropped immensely after adopting widespread use of these drugs. France is following their lead and the data coming out of France in the coming weeks will help confirm the efficacy of using zinc ionophores.

Chinese data are rightfully criticized for being unreliable, but South Korea's case fatality rate is an order of magnitude lower than countries like Italy where the zinc ionophores has not been reported being widely used.

The discovery of this existing cheap and widely available treatment is what will help return us to normal. The next step will be a rushed vaccine by the next flu season to hopefully permanently put covid19 behind us.

I should note that the early studies have ""flawed"" methodologies. The most recent peer reviewed study has a very small sample size. But this is the nature of emergency crisis situations. You need to use incomplete and often flawed data, apply a giant margin of safety on it, and then draw conclusion about what will likely develop.

My opinion is that there has been enough data to show that we can probably dramatically decrease the scary case fatality rate to something manageable. All studies are showing the efficacy of these drugs and CFR data from countries using these treatments show drastically fewer deaths.

Another good news is that my feared ""paradigm shift"" may be alleviated as well. I warned that the most important news to look for is the mutations of this virus. This virus's spreading characteristics makes it very unlikely evolutionary pressures will heavily favor more benign versions of the virus. This is because other viruses like SARS burn out quickly and prevent its own transmissions. They show symptoms too quickly and kill too quickly making it easy to detect/contain. This virus with its multiweek asymptomatic spread means the deadliness of it will not be easily selected out through evolutionary process. So it can evolve deadlier strains and propagated almost as easily as it can evolve more benign strains.

And with rapid mutation of new strains, this will hamper efforts to vaccinate against it.

However, with zinc ionophores, we may have a more general treatment option that will work on subsequent mutations and strains. This may help us stomp the virus out and prevent a paradigm shifting reality where we have ""seasonal flus"" of various strains of covid19 that kills 15x-20x more people than our current seasonal flus.

Once news of this starts circulating through America, and more data comes out of countries like France, I believe that the market will reach its bottom.

I should note that there are a lot of ""lagging indicators"" like unemployment that will continue to worsen for months after the market finishes nose diving. Just because the market bounces back doesn't mean a lot of layoffs, bankruptcies, and foreclosures won't continue to happen.

For this third post, I had originally wanted to create a thorough discussion on the 35 or so crucial leading indicators I believe will predict and even pin point he exact turning point in our financial markets. There are some fascinating data points from other countries/regions/industries that leads our financial market remarkably consistently. But I have repeatedly warned against using models based on previous crises to predict what will happen with this virus because of its unique and unprecedented effect on our markets. We can't use past models of previous diseases to model this because those previous diseases have vastly different characteristics (rates regarding spread, hospitalization, death, effect on economic actors). So I'll put those leading indicators off for now and stick with my original thesis. We almost certainly have the treatment now, the next step is a vaccine before the next flu season. The end of this market bloodshed is likely in sight."

On March 9th, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) released a broad agency announcement. This announcement addressed the organization's areas of interest in response to COVID-19 pandemic. 

-

*Interests Areas in the Announcement Included: 7.7.1 - Diagnostic Assay for Human Coronavirus via Existing FDA Cleared Platforms*

-

[BARDA is seeking proposals for the development, and FDA clearance of an in vitro diagnostic pan-coronavirus assay that can also differentiate known human coronaviruses \(SARS-CoV-2 \(2019-nCoV\), MERS-CoV, CoV 229E, CoV OC43, CoV NL63, and CoV HKU1\) in clinical specimens.](https://beta.sam.gov/opp/1b46a4169fcb4902b9c4fcbb5bf981f7/view?keywords=genomic%20virus&amp;sort=-modifiedDate&amp;index=&amp;is_active=true&amp;page=2) 

The assay should be designed to test clinical specimens including upper (e.g, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal wash/aspirate or nasal aspirate) and lower (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate, sputum) respiratory tract specimens and blood (whole blood, plasma or serum). BARDA prefers assays that will be used with an existing FDA-cleared molecular platform that is currently widely placed in U.S. healthcare settings. BARDA will also prioritize manufacturing in the United States.

* On March 5th, [a German based lab demonstrated](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200304005866/en/) feasibility to detect SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) using Hologic’s Panther Fusion System in conjunction with the Panther Fusion Module. 

-

* Their success was noted in the [Journal of Clinical Virology \(Volume 125, April 2020\)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220300470?viewFullText=true). The authors were able to detect the experiments positive controls through adapting two recently published PCR protocols, which detect either the E gene of the old 2002 SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV -2 (and closely related bat beta coronaviruses) or specifically the RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, the authors stated that “rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 is feasible with the Panther Fusion but further validation with clinical specimens is required”. 

-

* The Hologic Panther Fusion system allows for 120 patient samples to be loaded and tested against 32 different assays simultaneously. Further, their system provides immediate, fully automated processing of diagnostic specimens including RNA extraction, amplification of target sequences and real time detection of PCR amplicons in about 3.5 hours. Hologic’s Panther Fusion System launched in Europe in 2010 and the U.S. in 2012, however the more recently released Panther Fusion module has not yet received CE-IVD certification or clearance from the FDA. Hologic has had previous success in obtaining FDA approval on numerous assays, which is listed on their [webpage](https://pantherfusion.com/). 

-

* Hologic’s latest offerings include the [Panther Plus and Panther Link systems](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/hologic-launches-scalable-molecular-testing-us-and-europe): Panther Plus adds additional capacity and throughput, allowing the platform to process more than 1,200 samples in 24 hours, while the Panther Link software connects multiple Panther instruments together to help streamline workflow through a central digital dashboard.

Gen Probe was acquired by Hologic in 2012. The Panther Fusion open access platform is a high-throughput platform technology that can be implemented for rapid coronavirus detection, Gen Probe pan-coronavirus (OC43, HKU1, NC63, 229E) and Gen Probe SARS-CoV-2 EUA assays. Gen Probe owns the Intellectual Property and is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Panther System.

IMO, this is setting up for a big move once they get FDA approval. The ability to conduct 1,200 sample test in 24 hours blows testing companies such as CODX and AYTU out of the water. This mass automated testing capacity will be the future solution to the surge in demand for COVID-19 tests. They are in with the Fed's already on Panther, it's only a matter of time."

Key Takeaways:

&gt; Unlike Amazon Go stores, shoppers will insert a credit card into a gated turnstile to enter, rather than scan an app. The turnstiles will display the logo “Just Walk Out technology by Amazon,” but all other branding and store aspects will be controlled by the retailer using the service.

&gt; A by-product of demand for the offering would be increased usage of Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud that underpins its checkout-free systems.

Thoughts:

Having seen the size of an Amazon Go store, this technology would work best for small sized stores like delis or bodegas. While these sales would not bring in a ton of money, it brings in the next best thing: data. 

With this data, Amazon can built better analysis of user behavior, which will help them towards implementing this system on bigger stores like Whole Foods. 

Once WF starts using this technology in their stores, it means Amazon feels comfortable enough to start offering this to other major retailers, which is where the big money will be made."

[New video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zHd8QNxPBo) updates with new information from the last 12 days.

TL;DW:

* No big surprises in impact to market sectors. Airlines, hotels, and oil hit the worst. Consumer staples and utilities hit the least.

* Some surprises in impact by market cap. Traditional wisdom would predict small caps would be hit the worst, then mid caps, then large caps, as people flee to the safety of blue chips. The data shows a more mixed result with some small and mid cap deciles holding up better than large caps.

* Analyzing by best performers from the previous year, the traditional wisdom would be that the highest fliers would be the hardest hit, but again the actual results are more mixed. Some deciles on the worst and best ends were hit less than deciles in the middle. This argues somewhat against the idea that recent high performers are so over-bought (Damodaran said ""richly valued"") that they would fall the most in a correction.

* Gold vs. ""Millennial's Gold"" (Bitcoin): Chart shows gold vs. bitcoin moving in opposite directions, which argues against the idea that Bitcoin is a safe haven similar to gold.

* Bottom line: As a function of the decline in 2020 earnings and the percentage recoupment by 2025, where 100% is as if coronavirus didn't exist and 2020 was on the same trajectory as it was before the crisis. S&amp;P 500 ranges from a worst case of 2423 (-20% earnings drop in 2020, 0% recoupment) to best case of 3068 (-5% earnings drop in 2020, 100% recoupment).

* Warning signals: 

** More downward adjustments to earnings guidance

** Earnings actuals significantly down YoY

** 10Y T-bond stays below 1% yield

** VIX stays near historic highs (increasing equity risk premium)

** Cash flow actuals significantly down, with attendant dividend cuts and reduced rate of new buybacks"

37,2020-03-05,ryeander,1,WSJ: Thin Liquidity in Stock Futures Raises Risk of More Wild Market Moves,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/thin-liquidity-in-stock-futures-raises-risk-of-more-wild-market-moves-11583365788?mod=mhp


Trading conditions have sharply deteriorated in a popular vehicle for betting on swings in the S&amp;P 500, exacerbating the volatility in the stock market in the past two weeks.

E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures play a huge, if little understood, role in financial markets, with hundreds of billions of dollars of trading activity each day. They track the S&amp;P 500 and typically move in lockstep with the broad-based index.

For reasons that aren’t fully clear, liquidity in the E-mini market has been unusually depressed during the past two years. It eroded to near record lows during the coronavirus-fueled selloff of late February, and it is still thin—a sign of potential turbulence going forward.

For most of 2017, the average number of E-mini contracts available to be bought or sold within a tight band around their current price, corresponding to a one-point move in the S&amp;P 500, hovered between 3,000 and 6,000, Deutsche Bank data show.


But over the past two years, that number has rarely climbed above 2,000 contracts. On Friday, it fell to just 163 contracts—down more than 80% from a week earlier—before slipping even further, to 132 contracts, on Tuesday, according to Deutsche Bank.

The term “liquidity” refers to the ability to execute a big trade without affecting the price of an asset. In layman’s terms, lower liquidity means that when a wave of selling hits a particular market, prices drop more sharply than they would have otherwise. In the case of the E-mini, heavy selling has a knock-on effect on the stock market itself—and on investors’ portfolios.


There are various ways to measure liquidity, and it is a matter of debate which is best. A simple approach is to look at the trading volume of a particular market. By that standard, liquidity in E-minis has never been better, hitting a record on Friday with more than $850 billion traded that day.

But the liquidity metric tracked by Deutsche Bank’s analysts—the number of contracts available to be bought or sold—offers a measure of how fragile a market is. When there are lots of traders posting quotes to buy E-mini contracts, they effectively act as a buffer against sellers putting downward pressure on the S&amp;P 500.

And by that standard, the buffer is now very thin.

“Markets have been walking on thin ice, on and off, for more than a year,” said Shankar Narayanan, head of trading research at Quantitative Brokers, a financial-technology company that provides software for executing futures trades to banks and hedge funds.

Futures are contracts that allow traders to bet on future price moves in many markets, including oil, gold and U.S. Treasury notes. Currently, the most active E-mini contract is tied to the value of the S&amp;P 500 on March 20. But in practice, it moves in tandem with the index’s current value.

Unlike stocks or exchange-traded funds, E-mini futures trade nearly around the clock, five days a week. Traders use them for a variety of strategies, including hedges to protect against market declines.

Kevin Davey, an independent futures trader in Cleveland, was among those who retreated from the market last week because of the vanishing liquidity. Mr. Davey runs a number of trading algorithms in E-minis, some of which shut down or dialed back their activity as measures of liquidity or volatility got too extreme.


“The sheer depth and extremity of the move caught me and a lot of people off guard,” he said. “When things get too squirrelly in terms of movement, sometimes it is best to stay on the sidelines.”

Exchange operator CME Group Inc., which runs the market, says $342 billion worth of E-mini S&amp;P 500 futures changed hands on an average day so far this year. By comparison, average daily trading volume of the entire U.S. stock market has been about $433 billion, according to research firm Tabb Group.

A CME spokeswoman pointed to the futures contract’s strong volume figures as evidence of its health. Last week, “a record number of market participants turned to the E-mini futures market to manage their risk,” she said.

It is unclear why E-mini liquidity has been in retreat. It appears to have never recovered from the shock of Feb. 5, 2018, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 4.6% and the Cboe Volatility Index spiked 116%, blowing up a number of popular volatility-linked trades in an event that some dubbed “volmageddon.”

Some market veterans say E-mini liquidity has deteriorated because of fundamental shifts in the futures world. In recent years, traders at banks and hedge funds have become increasingly likely to buy and sell futures using automated algorithms, which tend to chop up large trades into many smaller ones. That has resulted in smaller orders being placed on futures exchanges, for shorter amounts of time, according to a study released last year by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Meanwhile, the number of market makers active in futures has dwindled as the industry has consolidated, with a few electronic trading giants such as Citadel Securities, DRW Holdings and Jump Trading expanding as smaller rivals have shut down or been acquired.

Precise numbers on futures market-making aren’t publicly available. But Rick Lane, chief executive of financial-software firm Trading Technologies, estimates that about half a dozen market makers now dominate the business. A decade ago, he said, there were at least 10 times as many market makers.

“That concentration likely has an impact on the volatility and likelihood of swings in the market,” Mr. Lane said."
38,2020-03-01,ThePiercoost,1,Take a read," 

Let me break it down for the people who cant think in macroeconomic mindsets.

The problem is not the fact that people will get sick and may stay home a few days in the US. That would be a small dent in the economy as healthy people don't have enough symptoms to even get the tests sent to the CDC. [https://abc7ny.com/5974999/](https://abc7ny.com/5974999/)

Therefore people are not seeing the problem of the spread. But as said before that isn't the problem and the problem isn't here in the United States. It is in the places where we get things from. The most imported from countries are China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany. ""Five countries make up almost half of all [U.S. imports](https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-imports-statistics-and-issues-3306260). They are China, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Germany.""

Which of these countries has coronavirus? All of them. Which of them is going to report how bad it actually is? Well, we can't even trust the US to report cases so **none** of them. [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html)

Therefore, we have to look at other factors. Such as traffic on maps, pollution, internet usage data...

And guess what? The spread is pretty bad and is shutting countries down.

Continuing on, this means the factories are not up and running, shipping is not having cargo come back in yet and doesn't expect it to anytime soon.

So what does this all mean? So what if we don't have a few goods? Isn't it just one sector?

This means it is kind of like the financial crisis. Except instead of the housing market relying on subprime loans, the US economy and most of the world is relying on second-world and third-world countries. And these countries have poor sanitation and high population density in cities. Therefore the virus will continue to wreak havoc. Especially with people getting the virus twice. (although I am skeptical of this because it is either mutating faster than any virus before it or maybe it is just shitty healthcare which is more likely) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/japanese-woman-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-for-second-time](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/japanese-woman-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-for-second-time)

39,2020-04-25,mekonsodre14,5,FT article: Investors baffled by soaring stocks in ‘monster’ depression,"[https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100](https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100)

While the headline is somewhat exaggerated, the premise is correct. 

**Here the whole article:** The divergence between the flying stock market and the dying economy is so extreme it is leaving many analysts scrambling for explanations.

The recent string of economic data releases reflecting life under global coronavirus lockdowns has been even grimmer than expected, spurring the IMF this week to forecast the biggest global recession since the 1930s' Great Depression.

Some investors are in awe at the scale of the shock. ""We really are in uncharted territory,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""We have a monster mash-up of the Great Depression in size, the crash of 1987 in speed, and 9-11 attack in terms of fear.""

And yet, stock markets have been on a tear for a month. What was once dismissed as a mere ""bear market rally"" often strong but ultimately doomed bounces that can occur in the middle of severe downturns - has now turned into a 23 per cent jump for global stocks. Technically, that qualifies as a new bull market.

The rise has erased half the stock market fall since late February, and brought the FTSE All-World index back to levels seen in the US tax cut-fuelled summer rally of 2017. Analysts and investors say that global efforts by central banks to soothe the financial system have been the trigger.

Citigroup estimates that the biggest central banks will buy $5tn of bonds this year, led by the US Federal Reserve, which is more than twice the size of the stimulus seen at the peak of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The Fed has even charged into areas once thought untouchable for central banks, announcing plans to support corporate debt graded ""junk"" by credit rating agencies.

Throw in various other liquidity injections and a series of government spending packages aimed at ameliorating the effects of measures taken to contain the coronavirus outbreak, and the overall stimulus bill comes to $14th, according to the IMF.

""The Fed has been very clear that it will do whatever it takes,"" said Joyce Chang, chair of global research at JPMorgan. ""The question is whether this will be enough.""

Many investors seem to think so. Technology stocks are once again leading the rally, but even travel and leisure stocks have jumped 24 per cent from the lows, trimming their decline this year to 37 per cent.

Investors appear to be writing off 2020, focusing instead on the prospects for an economic normalisation in 2021, analysts say.

Some of the technical forces that fuelled the sell-off are also helping stoke the comeback. Hedging by banks, trading strategies that automatically buy when volatility simmers down, and thinner liquidity are all now supporting the rally, according to JPMorgan.

History also offers some encouragement to the optimists. Bespoke Investment Group crunched the numbers on every big US stock market slump, and found that once equities had clawed back over half their losses, that had tended to signal that the lows would not be retested.

One notable exception, however, was after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. The US stock market rallied over 44 per cent from the November 1929 low through to March 1930 before sliding another 80 per cent, and did not reclaim its 1929 highs until September 1954.

Some investors think this is a plausible scenario now. Paul Singer, the head of Elliott Management, warned that stocks could easily renew their slide and drop by half from the February peak.

""Despite the massive stimulus moves around the world and the unimaginably large new rounds of money printing, there is substantial uncertainty about the future viability of a large range of businesses,"" Mr Singer wrote, in a recent letter to clients. ""To us there does not appear to be a gilded cornucopia of shining bargains.""

Some nervousness began to creep back into markets this week, triggered by ructions in the oil market crowned by the unprecedented sight of the benchmark US crude price sliding below zero on Monday. Although partly a technical dislocation, it underscored the fragile state of the global economy.

Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season has started to reveal the extent of the revenue destruction hitting many companies. And such grim results may pale next to what is likely to be a

""horrific"" second quarter, warns Karen Ward, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

The message was hammered home by data released on Thursday showing another 4.4m Americans claiming unemployment benefits, taking the total since mid March to over 26m. A potential antiviral drug for coronavirus failed its first randomised clinical trial, further denting sentiment.

Ms Sonders points out that even if equities do not plunge below the lows of March, economic downturns of this magnitude tend to produce a lot of head-fake rallies and stomach-churning sell-offs.

""Anyone who thinks we're going to keep moving up in a straight line is living in la-la land,"" she warned.

\------------

I guess that's what the majority here feels anyways. Doesn't mean you should not be building clever positions at this moment in a few stocks, but these should be true conviction buys based on good entry price, solid company products with longterm growth potential, neat balance sheet and a capable leadership team. Keep 70% to 80% cash."
40,2020-04-25,proprietism,1,"Analysis: ""Big 3 Investing"" has beaten the market the past 25 years","I have done an analysis comparing purchasing the top 3 US market cap companies every year on January 1st and holding until today vs. purchasing the same amount of SPY on January 1st and holding until today (close price on 4/24/2020.)

To determine ""top 3 market cap"" I used the Q1 values in [Financial Times' Global 500 list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization). Since the FT Global 500 list started in 1996, that is where I begin.

In my **Big 3 Portfolio**, I purchase $1000 worth of each that year's top 3 market capitalization companies at their Jan 1st open price.

In my **SPY Portfolio**, I purchase $3000 a year of SPY (S&amp;P 500 tracking index, aka ""the market"") at it's Jan 1st open price.

Thus the total cash basis of 25 annual batches of $3000 is $75,000 for each portfolio.

I found that the Big 3 Portfolio beat the SPY portfolio by about **$34,281.34, 20.75% over the value of the final SPY Portfolio value.**

*IMPORTANT NOTES:*

* *After pulling all the data, I realized the faulty assumption of this study is that the FT500 market cap ranking is posted on January 1st to know which 3 companies to purchase for that year. I have no idea what day it was posted, and if the years before the FT500 went to quarterly rankings were later in the year it might be showing more in hindsight instead of foresight. In hindsight, I probably should have purchased the previous year's top picks those early years and the previous Q4 picks after the survey went quarterly. May do a version 2 along those lines at some point.*
* *I do not reinvest dividends. I may include that on a version 2.0.*
* *I used fractional shares (i.e. however many shares you could have purchased with exactly $1000). That might not have been possible when this started but is possible now.*
* *This assumes no additional buying or selling. Another analysis worth doing might consider selling companies that drop out of the top 3 on the last day of the year and buying the new ones taking their place with the profits you have built up so far. This would keep you from holding companies like GE and Exxon as they decline and likely lead to bigger returns, I'd guess.*

Here are my findings, broken down into combined annual lots of $3000 for each portfolio.

The annual Big 3 lot beat the annual SPY lot long-term 19 out of 25 years. This is very heavily indebted to Microsoft offsetting many years of Exxon and GE being top 3 companies which are now in major decline. On the individual stock side, it wasn't nearly as lopsided: 38 of 75 batches beat $1000 worth of SPY purchased on the same day, 37 did not. As we slip into the past decade, that number drops drastically, with 25 batches outperforming the market and 8 underperforming it.

Microsoft (21 years), Apple (11 years) Amazon (2 years) and Google (3 years) beat the matching SPY lot every single year it made the list.

Exxon (19 years), GE (13 years), Cisco (1 year), Chevron (1 year), Wal-mart (1 year) and Coca-Cola (1 year) lost to the SPY lot every single year they made the list.

Berkshire split, with one year beating the market and one year losing to it.

42,2020-04-23,cmbscredit,1,Credit Market Insight: Blackstone's GSO Hedge Fund loses 30% last month on Distressed Debt,"Blackstone’s GSO Distressed-Debt Bets Post 30% Quarterly Loss

Energy sector investments sour along with oil prices

‘Distress takes time to play out,’ COO Jonathan Gray says  


By Katherine Doherty

(Bloomberg) -- GSO Capital Partners LP reported its worst performance in at least a decade from distressed-debt investments, even as the pandemic boosted potential targets in March to almost $1 trillion.

The credit arm of Blackstone Group Inc. recorded a negative 30.3% net composite return on distressed assets during the first quarter, the company said in a Thursday statement. The losses were driven in part by energy, which hobbled returns and remains a deeply troubled sector, management said during a quarterly earnings call with investors.

The loss compares with a 3.1% gain in the same quarter a year earlier and negative 1.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019, when energy was also a drag. More recently in April, a supply glut and crashing demand sent oil futures prices into negative territory during April.

“We’re already seeing opportunities appearing” from dislocation in the markets, but “distress takes time to play out,” Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Gray said on the call. The firm is “looking for businesses that are cyclically, not secularly, under pressure,” Gray said. “Strong companies and properties recover and flourish” with time.

Distressed net returns for the last 12-month period were also down 35.3%, according to Blackstone’s presentation. The figure measures profit after taxes, fees and carried interest. By contrast, GSO posted a negative 14.1% net return on its performing credits for the quarter.

Investors in distressed debt struggled to post gains last year because low interest rates and frothy credit markets helped troubled issuers find new backers to bail them out. Now the coronavirus pandemic has created new targets for credit investors to buy at steep discounts, with the total approaching $1 trillion at one point during March, according to data compiled by Bloomebrg.

“It’s a better investment environment than it was before both the leveraged loan and high-yield market sold off,” Gray said on the call. Those markets have recovered some ground, “but there are still plenty of names that are trading at big discounts, so for our distressed arm that creates opportunities.”

The firm deployed roughly $3 billion during the first quarter, management said. The amount of assets specific to distressed-debt investing is around $7.8 billion, about 1% of Blackstone’s total $538 billion pool, according to a company representative.

The entire credit unit managed $128.7 billion as of quarter end, a step down from $132.3 billion in the same period last year. Credit remains the third-largest business unit at Blackstone.

Blackstone’s supply of unused capital available to invest in credits of all types and insurance stood at $27.9 billion, down from $28.7 billion in the prior quarter.

Distressed Leader

GSO is watched closely by investors because it’s one of the largest and most active distressed-debt investors. Returns in the field can vary widely each quarter, with results depending in part on when troubled issuers decide to take corrective actions and when deals are completed as well as court rulings.

GSO’s composite gross return for distressed assets before fees and deductions was down 31.8% for the quarter, better than the 41% drop in the benchmark ICE BofA distressed-debt index. The results trailed both GSO’s 3.7% gain in the first quarter of 2019 and negative 0.8% in the fourth quarter of last year.

In contrast to GSO’s recent performance, a Blackstone-backed hedge fund recorded one of its best-ever months with bets in corporate distress as the coronavirus pandemic started taking hold in Europe. Bybrook Capital’s master fund gained about 17% net of fees in March and 19% for the first quarter, Bloomberg reported."
43,2020-04-23,cavemantradez,1,Arista Networks (ANET),"Hi there, long time lurker in this sub and wsb, but figured I need some non-autist brains on this one.

For days, I have been thinking about throwing my entire savings at this bad boy. Here's why:

As far as I know, Arista provides the infrastructure to build software driven cloud networks, partnering with cloud giants like Microsoft.  From the website, quote - unquote,  'Arista Networks is a leader in building scalable, high-performance and ultra-low latency cloud networks with low power consumption and a small footprint for modern datacenter and campus environments. ' I am no expert on this, but for what it is worth, I am pretty certain cloud computing will get stretched as fuck during this coronavirus shitshow, and even more so in the (near) future where we will almost certainly experience a paradigm shift to more remote working, with cloud technologies at the forefront.

On top of that, just yesterday, Arista boasted a Cognitive Wifi solution amongst other things that mean absolutely fuck all to my autist brain. Read it up yourself, but my understanding is that it ""(harnesses) the power of the cloud, big data analytics, and automation"", "" enables higher data rates and increased capacity"" and ""provides customers with enhanced Wifi experience for critical video collaboration applications and the power of cloud-based AI for rapid problem resolution"". We all know what that mean don't we.

Ok, maybe not, which is why I am here. Any experts in this field, or just anyone who knows about Arista here could enlighten me on the potential of Arista technologies?

Moving on to the financials, this boy sure as hell looks juicy. Net income has consistently been in the uptick, with over 830 million last year, more than twice of its net income in 2018. It has 2 billion in cash, in case anything goes south which I doubt they will. Net debt is fucking 0, unlike many other companies which are already positioned far more shittily in this COVID fuck fest. Capital expenditure has also been on  a steady rise, beckoning more technologies that could help position itself as we become increasingly reliant on data networking and cloud computing. Its cash flow has also been nowhere but in the uptick. As of now, Arista hasn't really been a Wall Street's favourite with many anal-ysts maintaining their mediocre ratings. Generally, I don't see a problem with this company's financials, and with a P/E ratio of  18x -20x and its potential in the near/long term, I don't see a reason why this isn't a buy.

Ok now,enough said, I am tired as fuck. Now, roast the fuck out of me and tell me if it is retarded of me to throw money at this shit."

edit:

from the financial times:  
 [https://www.ft.com/content/2669d6de-a381-400b-a678-64506dc60eed](https://www.ft.com/content/2669d6de-a381-400b-a678-64506dc60eed)  


&gt;Investors who have flooded into the oil markets to bet on a rebound in crude prices are risking big losses, say commodity specialists, as the exchange traded funds they use are swept up in the current market turmoil.  The United States Oil fund, the largest oil ETF known as USO, saw inflows of about $1.5bn last week, as US crude prices hit their lowest levels since the early 2000s on plunging demand.   
&gt;  
&gt;Professional traders said retail investors, in particular, were trying to pick the turning point for oil, betting that the market will recover quickly once coronavirus-fighting measures are eased.  But prices had further to fall. On Monday, West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, crashed below zero for the first time in history, dropping as low as minus $40 as traders dumped the contract for delivery in May. The June contract, where most of USO’s investments currently sit, lost 15 per cent to about $21 a barrel.    
&gt;  
&gt;Investors are not just at risk of placing a wrong-way bet, traders say, as oil contracts do not trade like equities. Instead, they expire monthly so the underlying crude can be delivered to buyers — something specialists fear could be poorly understood by greenhorn investors.  “Investment in ETFs currently harbours high risks to investors who might be tempted to passively invest in oil due to ultra-low prices,” said Michel Salden, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Losses can occur when tracker funds have to “roll” their exposure when contracts expire, Mr Salden said.     
&gt;  
&gt;If the oil market structure shifts into “contango” — an industry term for when spot prices are trading below contracts for future delivery — then an ETF might have to sell its contracts at the lower price, then buy the next month’s contract at a higher price just to maintain its holdings.  Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank’s head of commodity strategy, said that the largest long-only oil ETFs had seen their net holdings rise by 400 per cent in the past month.   
&gt;  
&gt;These ETFs, he warned, “are predominantly positioned at the front of the futures curve and will be exposed to rolling losses every month until the market fundamentals eventually stabilise”.  That process “could take several months,” he added.  USO was the fourth most actively traded ETF in the US on Monday morning, with more than half a billion dollars changing hands before lunchtime in New York, as the WTI spot price plummeted.    
&gt;  
&gt;**Investors’ move into USO is reminiscent of 2009, when many investors bought the ETF as crude prices slipped to near $30 a barrel, before almost tripling over the next 12 months as the world economy emerged from the depths of the financial crisis. Investors found their ETF returns did not match the oil-price gains, as they had lost a large chunk of their investment each month through the process of rolling contracts.**  The USO fund, launched in 2006, typically absorbs cash from investors when crude prices hit bottom. Inflows previously peaked in early 2009 and in early 2016, just after oil-price crashes. Since March, the number of shares outstanding in the fund has doubled as new cash comes in.  
&gt;  
&gt;As of Friday, the fund held the equivalent of 146.5m barrels of WTI crude futures for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a division of CME Group. That was more than a quarter of the total open interest in the contract, exchange data showed.     
&gt;  
&gt;Nymex market rules impose “accountability levels” of 10m barrels equivalent for most US crude futures contracts, above which traders can be ordered to reduce their position. CME declined to comment on whether it had communicated with USO.  The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a government regulator, has proposed a 6m-barrel limit on individual fund positions in US crude on the brink of delivery, but refrained from setting caps for positions in contracts for delivery later on.    
&gt;  
&gt;Some traders say the USO fund is big enough to exacerbate price moves between different contract months as it rolls out of one position and into another. “That definitely can put downward pressure on the market,” said Joe Raia, a former senior executive in energy futures at Nymex and Goldman Sachs.     
&gt;  
&gt;USO announced last Thursday that it was moving 20 per cent of the WTI contracts it holds into later months, in a move widely believed to have been influenced by the blowout in the spread between crude prices.  The position “just got to the size where it makes sense to spread it out,” said John Love, chief executive of US Commodity Funds, which runs the USO fund, on Friday.   
&gt;

This is a proxy trade on private equity via a publicly-listed BDC with RIC treatment.

**Underlying:** 

Palantir (Peter Thiel's Big Data snooping company, estimated valuation 20bn)

Coursera (Standford alumni online education startup seeded by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and New Enterprise Associates, valued at over 1bn in 2019).

**Proxy/Fundamentals:**

Sutter Rock Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: SSSS) is a business development company with market cap around 100mn with the following exposure (largest components):

|Portfolio Investments | Shares/ Principal|Cost  |Fair Value| % of Net Assets|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Coursera, Inc.| 2,961,399 |$ 14,519,519|$ 33,569,902|16.79%|
|Palantir Technologies|5,773,690|$ 16,189,935|$  31,582,084|15.80%|

**Technical:**

Current share price: $6.12

52-week Low/High: $3.60/$7.17

Price action indicators: [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-SSSS/technicals/)

**Catalyst:**

Insider buying activity: [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ssss/insideractions)

Narrative: Mr. Richard Salisbury Birch is a Wall Street veteran (55-year long career according to FINRA) who owns over 18% of Sutter Rock following his recent stock purchases worth cca. $3m only since March 2020 (his stake is up 18.2% this year, most recent purchase on April 9th).

News reports show Palantir on track to surpass $1bn in revenue this year, winning corporate deals and being awarded public contracts as well. The London office is actively expanding and their specialty is extremely sought after by both governments and medical organisations (national healthcare providers, medical companies) to help combating the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coursera also have positive news since April - new plans and expansion in new teritories.

&amp;#x200B;

**Time frame:**

The upcoming recalculation of NAV in either Q2 or Q3 will very likely reflect the expected performance from the two largest assets. The 10k reflect Sutter Rock's portfolio composition as focused on data plays and education, all receiving favorable impact from the lockdown/pandemic measures.

&amp;#x200B;

**Execution:**

The stock is optionable but not very liquid. The optimal execution appears to be a long stock position coupled with a call option with September expiration.

&amp;#x200B;

**Target price:**

12.35usd/share by October 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

It appears this could be a simple trade with 80-140% net profit annualized.

I welcome your thoughts.

48,2020-04-18,cashforstonkers,10,Tesla Long Term Bear vs Bull Thesis,"With Tesla moving back towards its ATH, I thought I would provide my perspective on the supreme-meme stock. Before the Tesla cultists jump on me and spam ban requests for my account, I want to give a bit of background. I bought Tesla 10 years ago when it was less than 1/10 of todays price, and sold a few years ago for a profit. I love Tesla's products and would gladly buy one of their cars myself. However, this is strictly about the value of their stock which I feel is very overvalued right now. Those of you who think you are visionaries if you are just now buying this company in 2020, lol. You are very late to the party and at this point are being spoonfed a lot of ideas by the new mainstream that are not supported by deductive reasoning or data.

Before I go on, I am aware that Tesla does not follow fundamentals nearly as well as other stocks. The wild speculations and cult-like following make the short-term prospects for this stock very unpredictable. I am just attempting to make an educated guess about the long term performance of this stock.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bull Thesis

1. Tesla's cars are the best thing since sliced bread or the first iPhone. They have the highest owner satisfaction of any car, and will become the most prevalent car on earth in the future and monopolize the market
2. Tesla is not just a car company, they are also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company. Thus they are a premium, innovative technology company more comparable to Apple than GM. They will monopolize several of these different markets
3. The company is not profitable now, but its income will continue to grow exponentially in the future due to our society's moving to green technology, and Tesla's prime position to capitalize
4. One fund manager (Cathy Wood) says she expects the stock to hit $7000 in the next 4 years (lol!)
5. New factory in China = \~1.5 billion Teslas sold (I'm being facetious)

The Bear Thesis

1. Not much of a point in focusing on current fundamentals or TA, since based on its current stock price Tesla's market cap is larger than the 3 major US automakers combined. Everybody knows their current sales are nowhere near justifying this valuation
2. We are on a 12 year bull run that many (most?) are predicting is over. In a recession/depression, the animal spirits that kept Tesla flush with cash despite their losses will fade away
3. Also in a depression/recession, less people are buying expensive electric cars or new cars period
4. Tesla investors want to believe it is a tech company, but a car manufacturer's profit margins are highly unlikely to ever match traditional ""tech companies"" (software &amp; electronics) in the future. There is a ton of competition, large overhead costs to produce and ship these products and the auto industry as a whole has been declining for years.
5. Electric vehicles are limited by infrastructure. The world's population is mostly urbanized and increasingly so. Where do you charge an electric car for an hour+ if you live in a small apartment, as is the case for nearly the entire millennial+ generation?
6. Tesla will suffer due to rock bottom oil prices. Going green is nice but ultimately economics are the strong guiding hand towards electric cars. It appears that oil will be cheap for at least a few years. Additionally, Trump is likely to win the next election (I don't like him myself, but I think this is the harsh reality). His presence will not benefit green companies like Tesla for the next 4-5 years
7. Government incentives that helped a lot with their early growth are drying up
8. Tesla has never paid a dividend and the company is very leveraged. Comparing it to other brand-name tech companies is silly based on this fact alone. Just look at their 10-k history, without the dreamer aspect it just looks atrocious. There is a reason this 17 year old (they are 17 years old and still not profitable!) company's debt is still junk rated by the major credit rating agencies. In contrast, Apple has had a net income of well over a billion dollars since 2005, before the iPhone even came out. Pretty much every other big tech company is the same, massive sustained profits for a long time.
9. By the way, since they were rated junk prior to March 22 Tesla does not qualify for Fed bailout money if things start to look bad
10. Tesla is seen as a leader in a few green fields right now largely *because they are allowed operate at a loss.* Other companies do not have this same luxury and are expected to return big profits. Toyota can't just go full electric and operate at giant losses, their shareholders will go nuts. Tesla has been allowed to do this for a surprisingly long time because of animal spirits. As soon as these green energy fields become profitable and the infrastructures start to take shape other companies will immediately jump aboard in droves. GM already has the Bolt which is actually a great electric city car. Volkswagen has spent tons of cash on EV development. I am sure as soon as total EV sales numbers become more than just a small niche their EV portfolio will take off, along with many other manufacturers
11. ""Tesla is also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company"". I see this quote nearly everywhere Tesla is mentioned. None of those are profitable for Tesla and all of them have major competitors. I think it is unlikely for Tesla to be a monopoly in any of these fields. Facebook/IBM/Nvidia/Google/Amazon are way ahead of Tesla in anything AI related, they are all filled with Stanford/MIT/Berkeley etc. graduates with 6 figure salaries. Similar statements can be made for autonomy, in which Tesla is also not the leader. Ford and GM are doing surprisingly well in autonomy, arguably they are outpacing Tesla  [https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery)
12. There are competing core car technologies. Hydrogen fuel cells, while inferior at the moment, have had several breakthroughs that may propel their green technology further in the next 10 years.  See here:  [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786). A lot of Tesla's value is hinged on their absolute dominance of their type of electric vehicle technology in the long term future. Challenges to this thesis substantially hurt their valuation
13. ""The future is self-driving taxis everywhere, and they will all be Teslas."" Another common point that is made, which is quite unlikely due to existing competition. Uber has a big leg up already. But also, going back to fuel cells: fuel cells recharge in the same time as gas, a couple min. Tesla's batteries take well over an hour to fully charge. Time charging is time not spent driving, which is lost revenue for a taxi. For now electric batteries are the winner, but it is not certain that in the long term future this will be the case
14. Many Tesla cultists think the growth will be exponential and soon their cars will be in every driveway. Just like when the iPhone came out, it grew exponentially for a long time. This thinking is flawed. For one thing, the iPhone has saturated in market share. At this point in time almost everybody who wants a smartphone has one and the phones are starting to blend together, we are entering a new period for the phone industry. Tesla will saturate the same way, their market isn't even a new field like the iPhone's was since people already have good cars. Once the early adopters have their cars, Tesla becomes less of a novelty. You are already seeing this in rich neighborhoods in California. If 3 of my rich neighbors have Teslas I want something unique. This is one of the main reasons no car company has ever been totally dominant.
15. Covid-19 will likely change the world, telecommuting will likely become much more of a thing. Jim Bianco talks about this a lot  (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M)). Historically a lot of people have never telecommuted and didn't know how to do it. Businesses needed to figure out how to structure themselves to operate in such a manner. Now that they have overcome this hurdle, telecommuting will become much more prevalent. Less driving to work = less need for an expensive car like a Tesla. For my weekend car, I'll stick with the manual transmission Porsche which is much more fun to drive for a couple miles
16. China. They opened up a factory in China, great. China has never stolen anybody's technology before (/s). The iPhone, made in China but its sales there have always been crap. They only recently hit single digit millions in a country of over 1b since the government actively promotes domestic brands, and strongly takes their side in courts. If a Chinese company makes a ""Resla"" that is an exact copy of the Model 3 and then sues Tesla for IP violation, you better believe they will win in China. China is experiencing massive GDP losses right now and an uncertain future, both politically and economically. There are many talks right now of reducing our reliance on China due to Covid and punishing them. IMO this all does not bode well for future sales of Tesla's pricey electric cars

TLDR:

Overall, I think that Tesla is a great company that will do amazing things in the future. We just have a lot of ""dreamer"" investors right now who think Tesla has some kind of infinite magic sauce. People who bought the stock early did well. And in 8 years, I think you will probably be able to buy their stock for $500 and enjoy a decent dividend and some more steady growth to follow. I think the people buying and holding at today's prices will see more crashes and no/low profits for a long time. I can see it retesting and crossing the limits that were hit in the crash a month ago, as Covid is far from gone at this point. I would only buy this stock if it goes below $200, and definitely would sell right now if I was holding."
49,2020-04-18,chatwithcanada,1,How to profit while others panic in a post-pandemic market,"## Introduction and Core Arguments

Stocks are down across the globe, save for a select few who directly profit from an unprecedented global pandemic.  [AMZN ($2369.00) ](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn)was surging at the time of writing, while the greater [s&amp;p remains highly volatile](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx). It is clear to some that we are on the very cusp of a Great Recession, similar to that of 2008 but unprecedented in scale.  Many stocks can be bought for a very low price at this time, and some will survive (or even thrive, like Amzn) and many may lead to massive profits for the long term investor.

If you bought before the 2008 financial crisis, you would have experienced tremendous short term losses.  Many people panic sold their assets because they needed the cash.  

You should try to remember that the **stock markets are always a gamble.**  

**Never gamble anything that you are not 100% willing to lose.** 

If you had held on to your assets, however, you would have experienced massive gains in the years to come.  If you had invested in NASDAQ right before the crash, you would still be up 20%. Don't attempt to time the market at a time like this, you are only increasing your risk significantly, and stand to lose more in opportunity cost than you might gain from acting now.  Understand that this virus has triggered widespread sell offs in the market.  People are starting to liquidate their portfolio, either for insurance purposes, or because they need the cash now.  

This is a deeply **worrying global trend towards a recession of unprecedented scale**. 

## The opportunity proposed

It is my opinion that it is possible to predict with a reasonable degree of accuracy, which companies will survive the implications of this recession.  The only variable that should influence your portfolio holdings and decisions should remain your risk-tolerance relationship.  **If you are the risk adverse type, please** **do not follow** **the advice below.** How the markets will react, or which companies will survive *massive* short term losses, is anyone's guess right now. Nobody giving you financial advice can predict the future, as there is always an element of risk in investments.  Again do not gamble anything you are not 100% willing to lose if your investment goes unfavorably. 

It is clear that there are currently a lot of buying opportunities in certain sectors that are effectively “on sale” at the time of writing. Various organizations in Canada’s Oil Industry, which have [recently been granted money by the Canadian Government](https://globalnews.ca/news/6833230/trudeau-coronavirus-arts-business-oil/) to weather both Covid-19, and the greater [state of the current Canadian oil economy](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/5-Crude-Could-Put-Canadas-Oil-Sands-Out-Of-Business.html), can still look dire to investors. 

Not all will survive, but there are many that will.  It is important that you decide for yourself which organization’s shares you will invest in.  Do your own research on which companies are most likely to weather the current situation.   Consider its lasting impact on a global economy which already had[ 3x more debt than it’s global gdp](https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/global-debt-to-gdp-ratio-hit-an-all-time-high-last-year) well before the pandemic triggered the recession it is now due.  Many investors argued that this was imminent long before the pandemic shuttered doors, and led to the lay off of incalculable millions. 

## The global response

Countries appear to be taking widely-varying stances on their exchanges, and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to whether or not their efforts will be beneficial in the long run.  France, Greece, Belgium, Spain, and Austria are all part of [a greater European movement to ban the short selling of it’s stocks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/european-regulators-extend-short-selling-bans-frustrating-investors-11587046533) in the hopes of maintaining their value.  Others, like the United States are taking a more aggressive approach.  In 2008 the US Government spent [$831 billion bailing out big banks, businesses, and the american consumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009). 

The rules have changed since then regarding bailouts, and just how far the US [Government is willing to go in order to maintain their own equity](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-data-shows-biggest-hit-to-business-activity-since-records-began). If anything they have relaxed restrictions, and there is much skepticism over the concern that certain big players have become all too familiar with the bailout process.  While the legal and political ramifications over the ethics of the bailout process are important to highlight how the rich actually do get richer, they are of little concern to someone looking to invest right now.  The damage the US Government has done, if any, has already been done.  

They are not likely to stop printing money and handing out bailouts to big businesses.  

## The impact of endlessly printing money 

It is all too familiar to some, to witness the degree to which the US Government is"" handling"" this crisis's impact on its markets. If you paid attention in 2008, now is the time to apply that knowledge today.  Hindsight is 2020, yet here you have an opportunity to take advantage of this huge upside potential, already equipped with the knowledge gained from close attention paid in 2008, and the following recession.  

If you are considering withdrawing from the market at this time, remember that the consensus among financial advisers was that if you had held assets before the 2008 financial crisis, and held through the following recession, you would still likely experience massive long-term gains. 

Pick which stocks you want to invest in, if and only if you plan to hold them through the recession and are comfortable with the risk involved.  

Nobody knows how or when the recession will end, or what implications it will have on the greater global economy.  Nobody knows how long the lock-down orders will last, or if there will be a second wave affecting certain countries perhaps relaxing social-distancing restrictions too early.  

Nevertheless, there are buying opportunities for savvy investors who wish to benefit from the long-term holding of their assets, assuming that the world doesn't end in its entirety, and that the short-term bailouts by the US Government can weather the dip or disappearance of revenue for some organizations for the foreseeable future and beyond. 

Vary your investments and strategy, and don’t put all your eggs in one basket.  In a bull market you might get lucky and win big, but in today's volatile bear market you are essentially playing the lottery betting on one specific industry, sector, or company.  Don't do that.  Diversify your assets over a selection of sectors posed to survive the ensuing Post-Covid Recession. 

It will be a recession of massive unprecedented scale, a Great Recession of the decades to come in the information age for all to experience globally in real time.  We are currently enduring a situation making history, and will be widely revered as an explanation to the world's massive over-extension of credit, improper and greedy over-leveraging of assets, and a multitude of various lessons that the ensuing recession will highlight for decades. 

## How to win more than you lose 

Smart money is made over time, with relative ease.  Buying dividend paying shares while they’re down so low in some cases, over 60-90% ; This can mean a lot of passive income for a long term investor.  There is also profit to be made on the simple price drop of some stocks which were admittedly over-inflated, but still are currently massively undervalued.  

The buy and hold strategy will prove incredibly profitable after the pandemic is lessened, and the recession runs its course.  It will take indeterminate time, and along the way may lose significant value before recovering.  It is also worth mentioning there is not much value attempting to time the market while it's low.  The often touted saying comes to mind, that nobody ever goes broke while turning a profit.  

Even if the market suddenly crashes the day after purchasing an asset, **time has proved that these investments saw massive gains the next decade.** 

## Conclusion and the Great Recession of 20-21

**If you take any lesson away from my thoughts on our current state of affairs, let it be to never sell when you're down unless there is a really good reason to.  Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose, but if you suddenly find yourself seriously cash strapped, it might make sense to liquidate rather than be evicted.**  

**If you can afford to lose in the short-term, and are prepared to hold through the recession, it is possible you stand to profit a great deal from the market's response to Covid-19.**

Nobody can say for certain what the future holds for the world.  It is most likely that this recession-to-come will be catastrophically large in scale. The most recent examples of great economic recession in today's economy are what we are expecting this upcoming recession to look like.  The ways in which the market reacts are similar but the situation is vastly different and can't be compared in complete parallel.  

The variables are very much not the same, but the underlying behavior both from the people affected, the businesses in need, and the governments printing endless cash are similar by nature. They serve as prime examples of human behavior, and global government's efforts to curb societal collapse.  

They **may** offer valuable insight into how the market will react to the ensuing recession.  It is up to you whether or not you would like to participate in the highly volatile, high risk markets of today.  If you do decide to buy and hold, make sure you are prepared to hold for the long term even when times get tough.  There are no gains unless realized, and the inverse holds truth as well.  

**Do not deposit** **anything** **you need to withdraw in the near future.**

50,2020-04-17,ArsMedMD,28,"Covid-19: Hydroxychloroquine, Remdisiver, IVIG, Vaccines oh my.","Reposting an udated brief review on treatment options for COVID-19 for those that have been interested in the new/non-news on remdisivir lately and noticed how little information caused a large speculative bump in Gilead. Original Post here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ftrd4w/thoughts\_on\_covid19\_and\_current\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ftrd4w/thoughts_on_covid19_and_current_market/) 

From an MD helping treat COVID-19 Patients (Initial post on 4/2/20) with a background in molecular biology to help preface what people should be reasonably expecting from these treatments in logical/mechanistic terms:

(-) *Hydroxychloroquine*: (Sanofi/SNY) It doesn’t work as a treatment in my opinion. It is a classic petri-dish versus human problem. It stops/reduces cell virus entry, which is great if you use it as a prophylactic as it will increase the required viral load needed to become infected. As a treatment though, when you have 50,00,000 copies of virus already, reducing the spread isn’t the same as treatment. I believe unfortunately by the time the virus is showing symptoms, a person has too many copies of virus so slowing the rate of repeat cell entry does not make a clinical difference. 9If you were going to die from the virus, you still will and HCQ won't make a difference) Further paper have demonstrated no real clinical difference from HCQ/azithromycin combinations and medically we have moved past using this as it just exposes patients to risks of side effects. The theory behind it is founded on a laboratory model that cannot be necessarily safely replicated (due to dosages) in humans. Would you rather die from COVID-19 or from HCQ overdose stopping your heart?

Overall: cheap medication with limited clinical benefit. Most upside has already been unraveled, greater risk than reward at this point in my opinion investing in companies behind this. 

\[ HCQ: Don't expect much going forward. \]

(+) *Antivirals (Gilead*): Possible area of research, but generalized research into antivirals as a broad class leave a lot to be desired. Used in combination with other medicines target other mechanisms of action they seem to work (HIV treatments) but in isolation they limit reproduction of virus. At &gt;50,000,000 copies the damage might be done though. The thought is the same to “flattening the curve” / slowing down virus replication to give your body time to fight it off. I think this will be an adjunct to treatment long term but given production constraints of remdisivir I don’t think the swing will be that large. (/”priced in” at this point from an actual bottom line to companies standpoint) This is like a hydroxychloroquine idea that actually likely works but even then has likely limited benefits just thinking mechanistically. Long term, I think the studies will show that people that get remdisivir early do a little better when controlled trials are released. (On the order of, 20/50 critical patients die without remdisivir versus 15/50 critically ill COVID-19 patients die with remdisivir. Useful as a drug, but not a game changer for COVID-19 at all)

Overall: expensive medication with possible clinical benefit. Long term will add to Gileads portfolio but seems somewhat ‘priced in’ at this point. Speculative play against COVID19 only.

\[ Remdisivir: Could have limited benefit, but absolutely not a silver bullet for COVID-19 even in the most rosy of speculations. \]

(+) *Tocilizumab (Chugai, La Roche/RHHBY*): An IL-6 blocker, one of the important co-factors in the cytokine storm which is likely the factor that kills people. IL-6 is something cells release to tell the body to ‘release the bombs’ which can unfortunately end up killing a patient before the virus can be cleared by said bomb.  Limiting its potential upside is the fact that it’s immunosuppressive and we don’t have a lot of long term data on how COVID-19 interacts with immunosuppressed people. I have become less bullish on this from my previous post given production constraints and cost of the medication (to produce and deliver)

Overall: expensive medication with likely clinical/mortality benefit but severely limited by production constraints. Limited background market outside COVID19.

(+) *Sarlimumab* (Sanofi/SNY, Regeneron/REGN): Similar to tocilizumab, also an IL-6 blocker.

Overall: expensive medication with likely clinical benefit but almost too expensive and hard to produce to really make a big impact. (like tocilizumab)

\[IL-6 blockers: Could be beneficial, but limited by production constraints and costs, baseline limited market outside COVID-19\]

(++++) *IVIG* (Grifols/GRFS, CSL Behring AG/CSLLY, Baxter/BAX): This is other people's plasma. Like vaccinating someone else, pulling out the antibodies they made against the virus, and injecting them into someone else. At baseline  has a good market (CAGR \~7.6% estimated over the next 4-5 years prior to covid) for multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders that 'flair'. The theory being that injecting other peoples premade antibodies to the virus will kill the virus in a targeted way while also mitigating the immune reaction and keeping your body from killing itself. Personally I’m extremely bullish on this and Grifols in particular as that is the product most hospitals seem to use around my area. CSL Behring also has a reported subcutaneous formulation which could keep people out of the hospital for infusions, limiting exposure/spread of virus as well.

Mechanistically this is the closest thing to a vaccine we can have short of the vaccine itself. It is less promising than a vaccine because its time/labor intensive to collect (you have to suck out other peoples blood) and doesn't stop the spread of the disease, unfortunately, but can be useful to stop people dying from it. 

Overall: Involved process of colelction with baseline shortage (mitigated by the fact that people donate more plasma during economic downturns, the financial crisis of 2008 was associated with an oversupply of plasma). Likely to have a large clinical benefit (From a clinical and mechanistic standpoints) and may become a mainstay of ICU treatment prior to more directed therapies/vaccines. Has a baseline market (other disorders) that will only increase in the background long term. Safety of a stable market/demand with upside as a massive treatment for COVID-19, and easing of a previous shortage due to increased plasma donation as well as a future market growth. 

\[ In my opinion the safest long term bet with also the highest upside of clinical benefit to patients short of a vaccine. You get the benefits of a good baseline market that requires repeat doses over their lifetime (multiple sclerosis, other autoimmune diseases), plus you have the upside of increased revenue streams from COVID-19 associated treatment, and you turn from a shortage constrained market to healthy supply of market as people rush to give up their plasma for an extra $500/month in their pocket, in which the company turns around and sells said plasma to the hospital for $10,000\]

(++++) Vaccine: A vaccine is the ultimate treatment, unfortunately there’s no way to pick which company will be most successful. I expect the first vaccines to not be very effective. All this to say, picking a vaccine company is impossible at this point with the available literature base currently. You could try to assemble all of the companies working on a vaccine that have a separately good pipeline to try to play the eventual massive swing when a vaccine is announced and limit downside when it’s not the company you picked.

51,2020-04-17,Last_Jedi,13,"Knowing what we know, what could make the market go back down?","We know about unemployment levels. We know that there is very likely a big recession coming. We know about how much Q1 earnings were hit. We know Q2 earnings will be worse. We know that plans are being made to re-open economies around the world.

Knowing all of this - what news could make the market actually trend downward from here? To me it looks like we're going to be in a sort of bubble pushing equities towards pre-Covid levels until Q3 economic data (unemployment and earnings) turns out to be lower than expected. But until then I don't see what worse information can come out that make investors run for the hills other than the Fed raising interest rates or stopping QE.

52,2020-04-15,truthhurtsman1,1,Debating between Oil ETF vs Oil Stock Company as at Today,"Preface: I am in the UK and looking at GBP denominated assets. 

In ""normal"" market conditions, say bull for the sake of discussion, with healthy economic data and no concerns for a ""correction thats incoming"", my quick (and I mean quick - 5 minute analysis) suggests to me that in the long term, Oil Companies (Shell, BP etc.) are outperforming both Oil Futures (current month) and Oil ETFs with exposure only to Oil Futures.

Now I know when it comes to Oil Futures theres the whole Contango effect and I also know with Oil Companies you have more than just the oil price impacting the price.

Let's say today I wanted oil exposure for a long period -&gt; Say 1-5 years. My main concern in getting to an oil company such as Shell, are they not exposed to the added downward pressure of Equity Market Downward trend we are currently in? i.e. assuming oil prices go up from here (and yes I KNOW this is an assumption), whilst Shell/BP may benefit from the prices going up, what if say the FTSE - 100 (of which they are big constituents) proceeds to drop to 5000 (roughly a 20% drop) and the Oil Prices go up by 20% in the same time frame (which translates to 20% increase in Shell/BP revenue for sake of argument) -&gt; do we not end up in the same position?

Would be we not be better then to invest in the Oil ETF, which should more closely match the movements of the future in the short term?

I'm just blurting out a lot of stuff and need an expert to swoop in and correct me to be honest. Hope this makes sense?"
53,2020-04-14,Davidkingq123,1,Industry Investment Preference - Now and Post COVID-19 Outbreak and Diversification,"I welcome everyone to share their thoughts are the specific industries that you have a preference amidst the current COVID-19 outbreak and the industries that you believe that will experience the largest rebound in terms of price and strong fundamental recovery post-COVID-19 outbreak.

**My thoughts:**

The best sectors to invest during the COVID-19 are those which are benefiting from the COVID-19 (i.e. those industries which they are gaining more revenue due to the COVID-19 outbreak:

* Internet &amp; Direct Marketing Retail under Consumer Discretionary, which is **up to +12.2% against last year.**
* Multiline Retail under Consumer Discretionary, **+1.4% up against last year**
* Food &amp; Staples Retailing under Consumer Staples,**+13.06% against last year**
* Household Products under Consumer Staples, **+8.33% against last year**
* Health Care Providers &amp; Services under Healthcare, **+14.54%** **against last year**
* Biotechnology under Healthcare, +10.60% **against last year**
* Health Care Technology under Healthcare, **+4.65% against last year**
* Semiconductors &amp; Semiconductor Equipment under Information Technology,**+7.73% against last year**
* Software under Information Technology,**+23.64% against last year**
* Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals under Information Technology,+30.38% **against last year**

\*Although the return below is against last year, it is also extremely indicative which industries have performed well during the recent COVID-19

**Why I believe that there are still at least 1-2 months to go for these industries:**

* Major economies such as UK and US death tolls are still trending upwards
* Death tolls still trending upwards in most of the countries
* Some countries turned the corner, with new cases in decline

**Sector preference once the market normalizes and COVID-19 is in a downward trend in all major countries:**

* Automarket
* Airlines
* Hospitality industry
* Consumer cyclical and Financials

I track daily **the development of the COVID-19.** Financial Times gives a daily update of the COVID-19: [Coronavirus tracked: the latest figures as the pandemic spreads | Free to read](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest).

**Diversification**

I am a fanatic of diversification and cross-asset correlation. I know that I can put a thousand 60 percent-correlated stocks into their portfolios and it wouldn’t provide much more diversification than if they’d picked only five. This is consistent with the **Holy Grail of Investing. How you guys are diversifying your portfolio**

**5. Recommendations amidst current market uncertainties**

* **Stocks:** Undervalued and quality stock: They have strong relative outperformance during all past 10 market crashes. You can track undervalued stocks on Bloomberg recommended by the best professional. Steps: **Bloomberg**, available in Lippincott Library or Huntsman Hall, contains some analyst **reports**. Type your company's ticker symbol, then hit the yellow &lt;EQUITY&gt; key, then type BRC and hit the green &lt;GO&gt; key. You can track the industries you want to search on stocks that are overweight by most of the investment banks.
* **Alternative assets:** For hedge funds outperforming the markets I use the Daedalus Investment Platform. [https://daedalus.investments/](https://daedalus.investments/). For gold, I use Goldhub available here [https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data)
* **Options and derivatives:** I like tasty trade, as it provides daily live discussion about the market and gives statics about real trades that they make. They are also live discussion with professionals PMs and rising stars traders....[https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/company-info](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/company-info)

54,2020-04-14,jedisneverdie,25,The Great Market and Data Divergence,"The data is being fed to us endlessly so I am not going to repeat most of it. But I do want to point out a few things that I think are incredibly important, things I have pointed out before in some form or fashion, but many still seem to be ignoring.

The S&amp;P was up 13% from the beginning of Nov 2019 to mid Feb 2020, in just 3.5 months. Prior to that it had traded between 2,500 and 3,000 for about 2 years on a very slight upward trend, but with a 20% drop at the end of 2018, hitting 2,350. The world wasn't shut down then. There was no virus. The economy was still ""healthy"".

As of this writing, the S&amp;P is down just 6% from November 2019 at 2,830. Yet almost every economist and analyst in the world expects a contraction materially larger than the great recession.

Going back to 1937 (these are recessions following the Depression, which lasted 43 months), the average length of the 14 recessions since then has been 11 months. Dotcom was 8 months and housing was 18 months. Dotcom S&amp;P peak to trough was about 24 months, 16 months longer than the official recession. Housing was 18 months, matching the recession itself. 

We are coming up on the two month mark from the 3,400 peak in mid-Feb, yet the recession is not yet official. We're still locked down. People are still dying. Emerging economies haven't yet been fully hit by the virus, where we could reasonably expect hundreds of thousands to die due to their incompetent governments, poor living conditions, and inadequate medical care.

The big difference this time is that central banks have been much more aggressive much more quickly to prop up financial markets and increase transfer payments to households, measures supported by trillions in new debt. Socialism has saved capitalism yet again. The greatest bubble in modern times is alive and well so the financial markets say. Stock markets are still bubbles, bond yields still assume there is no risk in the world.

Q1 earnings are coming out and they look terrible, with more to come in upcoming quarters, and yet we're down 6% from November. It seems the greatest economic contraction in modern times is worth about 6%. It was worth over 50% for both dotcom and housing. I guess this time it's different. We should applaud central banks the world over for making our economies risk free."
55,2020-04-13,cooleddy89,1075,"Market Analysis: Focusing on what is ""baked into"" the future with high probability","Hi All,

Like many other investors, I rapidly became overwhelmed with the uncertainty in the future. Consequently I decided to focus in on what we know now with high probability. Essentially this is assuming all fiscal / monetary policies as currently enacted and consensus estimates on COVID-19 mitigation (i.e. gradual resumption of normal commerce after mid to late Q2). See more detailed assumptions later. 

&amp;nbsp;


Some facts going into the analysis:

* 2019 saw a ~30% gain in the S&amp;P 500, however corporate earnings were nearly flat. Consequently, the 30% rise in the S&amp;P 500 was due almost entirely to increases in valuation, i.e. stock investors paying more for future earnings
* The OECD had projected in September 2019 3.0% Global GDP growth and 2.0% for the US. This was already a deceleration of global growth from 3.6% worldwide in 2018 and 2.9% in the US.
* US Manufacturing, according to the ISM and IHS Markit surveys, weakened through most of 2019 (although showed a slight rebound near the end of year)
* US Business investment also declined through much of 2019, potentially due to the ""trade war"" between the China &amp; the US
* US Consumer spending remained robust throughout 2019, although also appeared to decelerate near the end of 2019 / early 2020. 
* US households had modestly de-leveraged as a % of GDP since 2008, and the debt servicing costs (due to lower interest rates) were at historic lows at the end of 2019. It’s worth noting the changing composition of household debt, with strong increases in student loan and auto debt while mortgage debt decreased. Housing debt peaked at ~$10 trillion in 2008, compared to slightly less than ~$10 trillion at the end of 2019. However, non-housing debt peaked at ~$2.7 trillion in 2008, while by 2019 non-housing debt stood at $4.2 trillion
* US Corporate debt stood at record levels as compared to GDP: ~75%. This debt had also deteriorated in ratings with the largest percentage in history rated as slightly above junk (BBB)
* The US deficit for fiscal year 2019 was estimated at ~$1 trillion pre-COVID
* The bulk of net inflows from 2016-2019 into US equities have been driven by stock buybacks. Since 2009, companies have spent ~$5 trillion in share buybacks

&amp;nbsp;


In short, my analysis is that the US economy entered 2020 with modest to low growth prospects. While consumer spending and household debt servicing costs remained bright spots, modest wage gains coupled with high housing, education, and healthcare costs presented a mixed picture. Both business investment and manufacturing activity were subdued, although hopes for a ""Phase 1"" trade war seemed cause for modest optimism. 

&amp;nbsp;

With those facts as background, here are my baked in assumptions for the following analysis:

* The OECD nations + major developing countries (China, etc.) modestly resume normal economic activity in mid to late Q2

* There is no vaccine or ""miracle drug"" until late 2020 / 2021
* Stimulus from major central banks globally prevents an immediate financial crisis or severe market distortions (e.g. the corporate credit market seizing up)
* Additional fiscal stimulus measures, while substantial, do not exceed the original stimulus bills (e.g. the $2.2 trillion US bill)
* The COVID-19 lockdown contributes to a severe recession in Q1/Q2 2020 in most countries, but the easing of lockdown measures + stimulus leads to modest to substantial recovery in Q3 2020. 

&amp;nbsp;


Alright, onto the main event. Here is what I think is ""baked"" into the future assuming the above events:

* Dramatic increases in sovereign debt levels. The US alone is estimated to run a deficit of ~$3-4 trillion depending on the severity and duration of the recession. With global debt levels already at records highs, it is unclear what effect these substantial debt levels will have (deflation, inflation, stagflation, no effect?) 

* Severe budget deficits in US state &amp; local governments. Increased spending on unemployment insurance and healthcare expenditures coupled with decreased revenues will force states to significantly cut their budgets. These cuts will include layoffs of non-essential employees. 
* Increased pressure on Euro zone economies, particularly Italy. Italian economic growth remained anemic in 2019 at 0.3%. With the complete lockdown of the Italian economy (which began in the economic engine of Northern Italy), Italy will likely face dramatic declines in GDP and correspondingly large government deficits. Northern Eurozone countries will be faced yet again with difficult choices with regards to Italian debt. Pressure from northern Eurozone countries on Italy risk furthering inflaming public opinion and leading to a separatist backlash. 
* Negative to zero growth in US consumer spending in 2020. Despite the enhanced unemployment insurance, stimulus checks, and corporate / small biz loans I believe it is unlikely that consumer spending will rebound in 2020. Consumers will prioritize on paying off debts, rebuilding savings, etc. due to the economic uncertainty. Furthermore there is permanent demand destruction in certain sectors, e.g. consumers are unlikely to replace all of their canceled vacations, restaurant visits, shopping excursions, etc. The ""wealth effect"" will work in reverse as many high income households see drops in both their investments accounts as well as variable compensation: bonuses, pay raises, RSUs, stock options, etc. 
* Unemployment will remain substantially elevated over its early 2020 low of ~3.5% through 2020. As in 2009, many corporations will ""do more with less"" in lieu of hiring during uncertain times. Small and medium sized businesses will face substantial revenue losses in 2020 and will focus on cutting costs to remain solvent. 
* Manufacturing and business investment will remain weak in 2020. Manufacturing will continue to stagnant due to sluggish demand for automobiles, aircraft, and other durable goods. Businesses will focus on preserving cash, paying down / refinancing debts, etc. due to weak global demand
* The US Federal Reserve will continue to support markets with QE and other monetary policy measures. 
* Increased likelihood of a change in US presidential administrations. In early 2020 the Democratic party appeared poised to nominate a progressive, divisive candidate in Bernie Sanders. By April 2020 Joe Biden, a center-left candidate, had secured the nomination. At the same time, the US economic outlook had substantially deteriorated. While the economy is likely to improve in the June-November timeline, it is unclear if this recovery will be substantial enough to allow President Trump to run on a message of economic recovery. The increased likelihood of a Democratic presidential administration is a corresponding decreased likelihood of further US corporate tax cuts.
* Dramatic decrease in stock buybacks in 2020. Companies will focus on preserving cash and reducing debt levels. 
* Significant deployment of ""dry powder"" from cash rich corporates and private equity firms (which have ~$2+ trillion in unallocated funds). These funds will look for opportunities in distressed credit, M&amp;A, and other opportunistic areas
* Continued low oil prices in 2020. While a modest recovery is possible, the magnitude of demand destruction for oil, the unraveling of Opec+, and the continuing impact of American shale drillers will contain price growth. 
* Continued China - US tension. There is little sign of a thaw in relations, and a hard line against China is one of the few popular bi-partisan issues in US domestic politics. Initial discussions to suspend Chinese tariffs during the crisis seem to have stalled.
* Emphasis on supply chain resiliency / diversification. Between the US - China trade war and the COVID-19 outbreak, OECD companies will face both investor and political pressure to diversify their supply chain away from China. This will bolster the slow and gradual shift that was already underway due to increasing Chinese labor costs and the perception of an opaque, unfair legal regime. In the short term this will drive up costs (China is a manufacturing hub for many reasons beyond cheap labor) which will either compress corporate profits or raise consumer prices.  
* Unlike 2009, there does not appear to be a new global engine of growth. China seems justifiably concerned about exacerbating their debt situation with massive fiscal stimulus. India was already experiencing a recession, and other major economies like Nigeria, Indonesia, etc. do not have the per capita purchasing power to stimulate global growth. Many of these countries are also suffering from the collapse in commodity prices and the flight from emerging market bonds / equities. 

&amp;nbsp;


I hesitate to forecast the future, because obviously there is significant uncertainty. However, my personal base case is that an immediate ""V-shaped"" recovery in asset prices is unlikely. For asset prices to reach or exceed 2020 levels would require corporates to either substantially increase earnings in mid to late 2020 AND investors to value future earnings at the same high levels of 2020. However, it is worth noting that the record low interest rates (and corresponding bond yields) and monetary easing could in theory drive investors into equities, real estates, private equity, etc. as the only option for positive returns. My personal base case is a sluggish recovery in mid to late 2020 with asset prices remaining volatile to shifts in sentiment. With the Fed stabilizing markets, a widespread global depression seems unlikely but could occur if high global debt levels trigger widespread corporate bankruptcies or some form of ""stagflation"". Another unlikely, but possible case is that the world emulates Japan after the early 1990s and experiences a long period of slow asset price decline as corporates deleverage, credit availability declines modestly, and no new global engines of growth emerge. 

&amp;nbsp;


Thoughts?

&amp;nbsp;


Edit #2: Adding in how to know I'm wrong


One thing that occurred to me is that since this analysis is slightly bearish, I should proactively offer some data points that would indicate I'm wrong / overly pessimistic:

* Rapid recovery in US consumer spending in Q3 / Q4 2020 to pre-COVID levels
* Rapid return to pre-COVID employment, ~3.5%, by Q4 2020 
* Increased US business investment / manufacturing activity in Q3 / Q4 to supplement or replace consumer spending
* The rapid return of the US corporate debt market which enables large stock buybacks in Q4 2020 onward
* Corporate earnings growth compared to late 2019 (i.e. not simply quarter on quarter comparisons against the likely awful Q1 / Q2 numbers)
* Massive US government infrastructure projects / other stimulus programs that generate demand and boost US household incomes 

Edit #3: Some people have correctly pointed out that India was not in a recession in 2019. Apologies, I should have said that growth had decelerated over 2019, with Q4 2019 growth estimated at ~4.7% compared to GDP of ~7% in 2018. I think my larger point stands that India's economy did not appear to be trending in a positive direction, and given their per capita income of ~$1700 4.7% is not sufficient to dramatically improve global growth.

3. fake news debate - FB and GOOGL have been proactively taking down false info during COVID-19, which appears to be helping their case to policy makers.

What will cause the next chaos in the market will be something which is currently unexpected and which might emerge.

Examples that are plausible tail-end risks to the virus:

1, Italy goes broke and cannot service its debt or will not service its debt. Possible as eurobonds aren't going to happen and they have a huge debt mountain. This would cause a debt spiral which would engulf the entire world and be an absolute financial disaster which dwarfs 2008. Italy could also trigger trying to leave the EU if eurobonds don't happen - public opinion has shifted due to the virus.

2, China vs the west break down of trade/relations. Company valuations are often based on global supply chains. If these break down (which could happen) it means all these blue chip multi-nationals that make up index-trackers suddenly lose a huge amount of potential value. This would cause a stock market collapse. This is possible as the west might hold china responsible for killing millions of people here. There will also be a movement against globalisation with countries being unable to source things from abroad in a crisis. Protectionism and pulling back from globalisation would devastate big multi-nationals.

So stop expecting bad unemployment numbers to cause a stock market decline when central banks and governments are pumping in trillions of dollars, pounds, yen and euros. It will be one of these new things which causes the next crash in the market."

While the direction of the market still hinges on when the coronavirus outbreak is slowed, some signs are emerging that the bulk of the selling in stock and corporate bonds is behind us, according to Bank of America’s Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett.

First is the sheer magnitude of the pullback. More than $20 trillion in U.S. stocks value was wiped out during the pandemic-induced sell-off, and investment-grade credit spreads have widened to 400 basis points from 100 basis points, Hartnett said.

“Tough for asset prices &amp; volatility to subside until human beings can safely leave their homes; that said ... lows on corporate bond &amp; stock prices are in,” wrote Hartnett, whose straightforward and data-filled notes are popular on Wall Street.

Secondly, a powerful contrarian “buy” signal for the market has been triggered. Bank of America’s proprietary “Bull &amp; Bear” indicator, which looks at recommended positioning of Wall Street, points to “extreme bear.”

The past four weeks have seen a record $284 billion outflows from bonds and $658 billion in to cash, Hartnett added.

The indicator shows investors’ recent exit from stocks and corporate bonds is overdone, Hartnett said, adding the extreme bearishness always leads to big bounces.


The strategist also predicted that “peak negativity” for the coronavirus will be upon us in April. As of Friday, confirmed cases of coronavirus have reached one million globally. 

Hartnett added the oil price war that roiled the markets earlier may be coming to an end. Oil posted their best week on record after President Donald Trump told CNBC that he expected Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to announce a deal to cut oil production by 10 million to 15 million barrels.

Still, Bank of America as a firm doesn’t see a big rebound. The bank cut its year-end target on the S&amp;P 500 to 2,600 from 3,100, which would translate into a nearly 20% loss for the full-year 2020 and is only about 4.5% higher from current levels. The new outlook represents the most bearish view on Wall Street, according to the CNBC Market Strategist Survey that rounds up 16 top strategists’ forecasts. 

The outlook reflects the bank’s U.S. GDP forecast of a 7.7% drop this year, which would mark the worst post-war recession in history. The firm also expects the S&amp;P 500 earnings per share to tumble 29% this year as the pandemic wreaks havoc on corporate profits."
63,2020-04-02,AloneForever,1,Reasons why markets aren't falling farther,"Some of you might be as perplexed as I am as to why the markets didn't fall farther, and why we saw that recent huge rally. I was holding some puts in anticipation of a bigger drop, and they lost about 90% of their value. Over 2 weeks (I've cut my losses).

Let's collect and list some of the reasons why markets aren't continuing to fall. I there's something missing, comment and I'll add it to the list. Here's the list:

* There's an expectation of a speedy recovery
* We only have 2 months to go until the shutdown ends (according to [this model which projects April 15 as the peak](https://covid19.healthdata.org/)), assuming the shutdown remaining in place through May
* Bailout bill is large enough to keep businesses afloat for the next month, maybe two
* The recently unemployed are mostly service industry people who will be hired back quickly once businesses reopen
* Oil price war may be over soon
* Tons and tons of cash has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for a good time to buy, now it's flooding into stocks
* The Fed's QE program means it's a good time for large funds to rotate out of bonds into stocks
* ETFs are the preferred investment vehicle for most people through their 401k or IRAs, and people are trying to ""buy the dip"" or just buying on autopilot
* Automatic rebalancing from balanced funds and roboadvisors
* Liquidity lifeline for banks and hedge funds and relaxed reserve requirements means fewer margin calls, less selling pressure
* Big funds, HFTs, and maybe even some MMs are waiting on the sidelines for things to settle down (which might be why volume dropped a bit recently after a huge surge)
* There isn't enough economic data yet
* Earnings reports haven't come out yet

My thoughts: I expected markets to drop another 30-40% a couple weeks ago, but instead we saw a big 20% jump. I'm still skeptical of the current situation, but if the virus growth continues to slow we might see that V recovery after all. I'm holding some bonds and a few call LEAPs for QQQ (tech will do well no matter how things go, IMO) and USO, as well as October VIX puts. I'm considering buying some RUT puts 3-6 months out to hedge against another big drop."

**Biotechnology in the COVID-19 Crisis Environment – “We are our worst enemy” Theory**

Hi all, I’m a neurology resident physician with a masters degree in molecular biology with a bit of extra time for the moment so wanted to share some personal opinions on areas that COVID-19 might push us towards.

Overall I believe the markets are emotional AF and are panicking currently out of line with reality. Panic looks for a cure, so having some insight into where that ‘cure’ might come from may be highly profitable to some.

**Thoughts On COVID-19**

For some reference and to possibly assuage your fears that the world is ending; as of 4/1, there are a reported 45,000 deaths worldwide related to this new virus. Worldwide, the #4 cause of death is a lower respiratory infection, accounting for 2,957,000 deaths/year (Not including #10, tuberculosis at 1,293,000)\^1. As a factor of mortality, COVID-19 should not be too scary to the average person (You’re still more likely to die from driving to work than from COVID-19, so staying at home really is saving lives!).\^2

This is not to say you should not be taking precautions. All of medicine is predicated on a cost versus benefit calculation. The benefit of being alive, versus the current cost being social distancing and hand washing. An easy calculation for most I hope.

My basic overall model for the future is underlined by the thought that we will not get rid of COVID-19. After this initial wave, we will continue to be hit with pockets of virus off and on. The virus itself will bounce up and down in years to come becoming part of our usual environmental anti-biome. A vaccine will eventually come around to synchronize with herd immunity and depress the virus to levels that people will return to their usual activity levels and every few years we’ll hear about a COVID-19 outbreak. Using this as a theoretically realistic model of what to expect, below are my thoughts on companies that may interface with this virus long term.

**First the Science-y stuff on COVID-19 that guides my assumptions (Simplified/Skippable)**

**Death by Cytokine Storm**

Though this virus is ‘new’, coronaviruses and similar viruses have existed for a very long time. Other subtypes of it are known as the common cold. We are almost all exposed to it in childhood without many hiccups. Similar to how many kids seem to be exposed to COVID-19 but don’t seem to be suffering nearly as much as adults.

This is likely because children’s bodies are trained to see new viruses and react to them in measured ways (Their immune system is tilted towards a **T-cell response**, which takes longer to respond, but responds in subtle ways to slowly tilt the battle against an intruder).

Imagine the T-cell(child) response as a coordinated intelligence program that takes time to learn about a threat and find a precise way target and kill it. It takes time in comparison to our **adult (B-cell) response** (why kids can be sicker for longer versus adult ‘day colds’).

The **B cell (adult)** response is like we kept all the intelligence information we got as a kid and kept the bombs, but fired the intelligence personnel. Why should we pay (calories) to you T-cell people if you’ve already figured out all the targets our body will need to fight in this life? So the T-cell producing organs shrivel as we get older and our immune system is mainly predicated on our B cells response.

But now, we’re exposed to a new virus. Our body turns to the old plans and bombs. The bombs fall, but the targets aren’t right. We hit some virus, we hit some of our cells, collateral damage may be more dangerous than the virus but the body doesn’t know that. We try to rehire old intelligence personnel to try to get them to figure out this new thing attacking us. As we await the hiring process, our body continues to drop bombs trying to destroy everything that might be infected, without knowing what the infection looks like. Eventually, our response is too much, we just dropped bombs on what is ostensibly \~80% of our own lung tissue and now we need a ventilator but there isn’t one available, so we 'suffocate' and die. The virus didn’t kill us, we did it to ourselves. In a storm of rebellion against an invader, we triggered a **cytokine storm\^5** and burned down the whole building to keep the virus from getting in. The B cells had one job, kill virus. Well the virus can’t survive in a corpse for long. Mission accomplished.\^3

(If you’re interested in this model, read about IRIS in HIV/IADS patient for an analogy. To put it simply, when we fix peoples immune systems they can die due to said immune system.)\^4

There is a growing bed of literature concerned about the role of **cytokine storms** in mortalitiy issues ie; this is the thing that kills people. This is the thing we can save people with if its prevented, below is some discussion on options to prevent it. \^5

Viruses in general, are not that prone to innately killing people. They want to keep you alive so they can reproduce more. Unfortunately, our immune responses to viruses can likely be more of an enemy than the virus itself. The biggest thing we want to prevent is death, so with the goal of reducing said endpoint of death, this are my thought on current treatment options and future avenues that could financially benefit.

The thoughts below are from my education in medicine and molecular biology and what I’ve seen from treating COVID-19 patients.

**General Medical Algorithm in treating any contagion:**

1. Prevent it. (Failed)
2. Mitigate it/Prevent Spread (Failing/Ongoing- Role for HCQ and Antivirals/remdisivr)
3. Treat it/Decrease Mortality. (Role for IVIG + Tocilizumab/Sarlimumab)
4. Cure it. (Vaccine)

I think we are ripely between #2 and #3 currently and the next big spike in equities will be in companies positioned to leverage #3. #4 unfortunately is too unpredictable at this point for me to comment on.

**Interface of treatments and finance options:**

More + = Greater Reward/Risk considerations.

(+/-) *Ventilators* (BDX, Phillips, etc) : Short term, essential to limit mortality. As COVD-19 hits hospitals hardest, it will drive up need for ventilators massively (already seen). Outside of the lethality of the virus, the biggest threat to mortality is a lack of ventilators. Initial demand will greatly increase. Unfortunately, once made, ventilators will likely remain long after this virus, depressing the market long term. As we get better treatments that work, ventilators will likely be needed less. Currently all we really have that we know helps is the throw someone on a ventilator and let their immune system kill the thing while we support them.

Short term outlook (&lt;6 months) Positive.

1-2 year outlook: Neutral.

(-) *Hydroxychloroquine*: It doesn’t work as a treatment in my opinion. It is a classic petri-dish versus human problem. It stops/reduces cell virus entry, which is great if you use it as a prophylactic as it will increase the required viral load needed to become infected. As a treatment though, when you have 50,00,000 copies of virus already, reducing the spread isn’t the same as treatment. I believe unfortunately by the time the virus is showing symptoms, a person has too many copies of virus so slowing the rate of repeat cell entry does not make a clinical difference. A few papers have now shown this but not in statistically reliable ways (Not enough patients, an expected limitation at this point). The closest analogue to this is amantadine with its prevention of the flu (which also, doesn’t really work because by the time you have symptoms the virus has spread too much to be clinically blunted). Also the theory behind it is founded on a laboratory model that cannot be necessarily safely replicated (due to dosages) in humans. Would you rather die from COVID-19 or from HCQ overdose stopping your heart?

Overall: cheap medication with limited clinical benefit. Most upside has already been unraveled, greater risk than reward at this point in my opinion.

(+) *Antivirals (Gilead*): Possible area of research, but generalized research into antivirals as a broad class leave a lot to be desired. Used in combination with other medicines target other mechanisms of action they seem to work (HIV treatments) but in isolation they limit reproduction of virus. At &gt;50,000,000 copies the damage might be done though. The thought is the same to “flattening the curve” / slowing down virus replication to give your body time to fight it off. I think this will be an adjunct to treatment long term but given production constraints of remdisivir I don’t think the swing will be that large. (/”priced in” at this point)

Overall: expensive medication with possible clinical benefit. Long term will add to Gileads portfolio but seems somewhat ‘priced in’ at this point. Speculative play against COVID19 only.

(++) *Tocilizumab (Chugai, La Roche/RHHBY*): An IL-6 blocker, one of the important co-factors in the **cytokine storm**. This is something cells release to tell the body to ‘release the bombs’. I’m hopeful for this as a treatment. If we go back to the original hypothesis, the bodies response to a ‘new invader’ is a large part of what causes the end point of death. Multiple studies have now launched across countries as this seems to be clinically effective. Limiting its potential upside is the fact that it’s immunosuppressive and we don’t have a lot of long term data on how COVID-19 interacts with immunosuppressed people. Personally I’m very bullish on this.

Overall: expensive medication with likely clinical benefit. Will likely become a key part of long term management of this disease as it will target the mortality causing part of the disease. Limited background market outside COVID19.

(++) *Sarlimumab* (Sanofi/SNY, Regeneron/REGN): Similar to tocilizumab, also an IL-6 blocker.

Overall: expensive medication with likely clinical benefit.

(++++) *IVIG* (Grifols/GRFS, CSL Behring AG/CSLLY, Baxter/BAX): This is other peoples plasma. Like vaccinating someone else, pulling out the antibodies they made against the virus, and injecting them into someone else. Targeted treatment that also blunts peoples own inflammatory response, limiting the effect of a **cytokine storm**. It is used as an immune-modulatory agent (not immunosuppressive) at baseline and has a good market for multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders that 'flair'. The theory being that injecting other peoples premade antibodies to the virus will kill the virus in a targeted way while also mitigating the immune reaction and keeping your body from killing itself. Personally I’m extremely bullish on this and Grifols in particular as that is the product most hospitals seem to use around my area. CSL Behring also has a reported subcutaneous formulation which could keep people out of the hospital for infusions, limiting exposure/spread of virus as well.

Overall: Expensive medication, already in shortage (increased demand/decreased production over the past few years) prior to this, with limited companies able to produce it. Likely to have a large clinical benefit and become a mainstay of treatment prior to more directed therapies/vaccines. Has a baseline market (other disorders) that will only increase in the background long term. Safety of a stable market/demand with upside as a massive treatment for COVID-19.

(++++) Vaccine: A vaccine is the ultimate treatment, unfortunately there’s no way to pick which company will be most successful. I expect the first vaccines to not be very effective and will unfortunately likely give the virus an opportunity to morph. All this to say, picking a vaccine company is impossible at this point with the available literature base currently. You could try to assemble all of the companies working on a vaccine that have a separately good pipeline to try to play the eventual massive swing when a vaccine is announced and limit downside when it’s not the company you picked.

(--) Hospitals in general: Will be hit fairly hard, most reimbursement for hospitals comes from elective procedures, self funded payment or payed with private insurance. COVID19 represents a glut of patients that are likely to not be able to pay, being shoved into expensive ICUs that the hospital will have to front unfortunately. On top of this are costs to retrofit hospitals for the increased burden. At the same time hospitals are needed to hire more people, cover shifts, and go without their main source of income dependent on a low government reimbursement rate. (Almost any US hospital would go under if it depended only on government reimbursement as of this moment so there is a very real risk to hospitals.)

From a financial standpoint, I think the IVIG market stands to benefit the most from all this long term with the least amount of initial risk though the research is still lacking in the field. This is the closest to a crystal ball prediction that I have given my education and experience with these patients.

Overall, things will hurt, in the short term and in a human term. People who could have been alive given proper government action will not be by years end regrettably. As it has though, the global markets will continue in their indifferent churning ways and in the end we will be preparing for the next downturn. We have gotten past many different pandemics before.

In the end, this too shall pass.

Also, thank you to all those that are washing their hands and trying their best to self isolate. I know it's a massive pain but it really is saving lives."

The **B cell (adult)** response is like we kept all the intelligence information we got as a kid and kept the bombs, but fired the intelligence personnel. Why should we pay (calories) to you T-cell people if you’ve already figured out all the targets our body will need to fight in this life? So the T-cell producing organs shrivel as we get older and our immune system is mainly predicated on our B cells response.

But now, we’re exposed to a new virus. Our body turns to the old plans and bombs. The bombs fall, but the targets aren’t right. We hit some virus, we hit some of our cells, collateral damage may be more dangerous than the virus but the body doesn’t know that. We try to rehire old intelligence personnel to try to get them to figure out this new thing attacking us. As we await the hiring process, our body continues to drop bombs trying to destroy everything that might be infected, without knowing what the infection looks like. Eventually, our response is too much, we just dropped bombs on what is ostensibly \~80% of our own lung tissue and now we need a ventilator but there isn’t one available, so we 'suffocate' and die. The virus didn’t kill us, we did it to ourselves. In a storm of rebellion against an invader, we triggered a **cytokine storm\^5** and burned down the whole building to keep the virus from getting in. The B cells had one job, kill virus. Well the virus can’t survive in a corpse for long. Mission accomplished.\^3

(If you’re interested in this model, read about IRIS in HIV/IADS patient for an analogy. To put it simply, when we fix peoples immune systems they can die due to said immune system.)\^4

There is a growing bed of literature concerned about the role of **cytokine storms** in mortalitiy issues ie; this is the thing that kills people. This is the thing we can save people with if its prevented, below is some discussion on options to prevent it. \^5

Viruses in general, are not that prone to innately killing people. They want to keep you alive so they can reproduce more. Unfortunately, our immune responses to viruses can likely be more of an enemy than the virus itself. The biggest thing we want to prevent is death, so with the goal of reducing said endpoint of death, this are my thought on current treatment options and future avenues that could financially benefit. 

The thoughts below are from my education in medicine and molecular biology and what I’ve seen from treating COVID-19 patients. 

**General Medical Algorithm in treating any contagion:**

1. Prevent it. (Failed)

2. Mitigate it/Prevent Spread (Failing- Role for HCQ and Antivirals/remdisivr)

3. Treat it/Decrease Mortality. (Role for IVIG + Tocilizumab/Sarlimumab)

4. Cure it. (Vaccine)

I think we are ripely between #2 and #3 currently and the next big spike in equities will be in companies positioned to leverage #3. #4 unfortunately is too unpredictable at this point for me to comment on.

**Interface of treatments and finance options:** 

More + = Greater Reward/Risk considerations. 

(+/-) *Ventilators* (BDX, Phillips, etc) : Short term, essential to limit mortality. As COVD-19 hits hospitals hardest, it will drive up need for ventilators massively (already seen). Outside of the lethality of the virus, the biggest threat to mortality is a lack of ventilators. Initial demand will greatly increase. Unfortunately, once made, ventilators will likely remain long after this virus, depressing the market long term. As we get better treatments that work, ventilators will likely be needed less. Currently all we really have that we know helps is the throw someone on a ventilator and let their immune system kill the thing while we support them. 

Short term outlook (&lt;6 months) Positive.

1-2 year outlook: Neutral. 

(-) *Hydroxychloroquine*: It doesn’t work as a treatment in my opinion. It is a classic petri-dish versus human problem. It stops/reduces cell virus entry, which is great if you use it as a prophylactic as it will increase the required viral load needed to become infected. As a treatment though, when you have 50,00,000 copies of virus already, reducing the spread isn’t the same as treatment. I believe unfortunately by the time the virus is showing symptoms, a person has too many copies of virus so slowing the rate of repeat cell entry does not make a clinical difference. A few papers have now shown this but not in statistically reliable ways (Not enough patients, an expected limitation at this point). The closest analogue to this is amantadine with its prevention of the flu (which also, doesn’t really work because by the time you have symptoms the virus has spread too much to be clinically blunted). Also the theory behind it is founded on a laboratory model that cannot be necessarily safely replicated (due to dosages) in humans. Would you rather die from COVID-19 or from HCQ overdose stopping your heart?   

Overall: cheap medication with limited clinical benefit. Most upside has already been unraveled, greater risk than reward at this point in my opinion. 

(+) *Antivirals (Gilead*): Possible area of research, but generalized research into antivirals as a broad class leave a lot to be desired. Used in combination with other medicines target other mechanisms of action they seem to work (HIV treatments) but in isolation they limit reproduction of virus. At &gt;50,000,000 copies the damage might be done though. The thought is the same to “flattening the curve” / slowing down virus replication to give your body time to fight it off. I think this will be an adjunct to treatment long term but given production constraints of remdisivir I don’t think the swing will be that large. (/”priced in” at this point)

Overall: expensive medication with possible clinical benefit. Long term will add to Gileads portfolio but seems somewhat ‘priced in’ at this point. Speculative play against COVID19 only. 

(++) *Tocilizumab (Chugai, La Roche/RHHBY*): An IL-6 blocker, one of the important co-factors in the **cytokine storm**. This is something cells release to tell the body to ‘release the bombs’. I’m hopeful for this as a treatment. If we go back to the original hypothesis, the bodies response to a ‘new invader’ is a large part of what causes the end point of death. Multiple studies have now launched across countries as this seems to be clinically effective. Limiting its potential upside is the fact that it’s immunosuppressive and we don’t have a lot of long term data on how COVID-19 interacts with immunosuppressed people. Personally I’m very bullish on this.

Overall: expensive medication with likely clinical benefit. Will likely become a key part of long term management of this disease as it will target the mortality causing part of the disease. Limited background market outside COVID19.

(++) *Sarlimumab* (Sanofi/SNY, Regeneron/REGN): Similar to tocilizumab, also an IL-6 blocker. 

Overall: expensive medication with likely clinical benefit. 

(++++) *IVIG* (Grifols/GRFS, CSL Behring AG/CSLLY, Baxter/BAX): This is other peoples plasma. It is used as an immune-modulatory agent (not immunosuppressive). The theory being that injecting other peoples premade antibodies to the virus will kill the virus in a targeted way while also mitigating the immune reaction and keeping your body from killing itself. Personally I’m extremely bullish on this and Grifols in particular as that is the product most hospitals seem to use around my area. CSL Behring also has a reported subcutaneous formulation which could keep people out of the hospital for infusions, limiting exposure/spread of virus as well. 

Overall: Expensive medication, already in shortage (increased demand/decreased production due) prior to this, with limited companies able to produce it. Likely to have a large clinical benefit and become a mainstay of treatment. Has a baseline market (other disorders) that will only increase in the background long term. Safety of a stable market with upside as a massive treatment for COVID-19. 

(++++) Vaccine: A vaccine is the ultimate treatment, unfortunately there’s no way to pick which company will be most successful. I expect the first vaccines to not be very effective and will unfortunately likely give the virus an opportunity to morph. All this to say, picking a vaccine company is impossible at this point with the available literature base currently. You could try to assemble all of the companies working on a vaccine that have a separately good pipeline to try to play the eventual massive swing when a vaccine is announced and limit downside when it’s not the company you picked.  

(--) Hospitals in general: Will be hit fairly hard, most reimbursement for hospitals comes from elective procedures, self funded payment or payed with private insurance. COVID19 represents a glut of patients that are likely to not be able to pay, being shoved into expensive ICUs that the hospital will have to front unfortunately. On top of this are costs to retrofit hospitals for the increased burden. At the same time hospitals are needed to hire more people, cover shifts, and go without their main source of income dependent on a low government reimbursement rate. (Almost any US hospital would go under if it depended only on government reimbursement as of this moment so there is a very real risk to hospitals.)

From a financial standpoint, I think the IVIG market stands to benefit the most from all this long term though the research is still lacking in the field but this is the closest to a crystal ball prediction that I have given my education and experience with these patients. 

Overall, things will hurt, in the short term and in a human term. People who could have been alive given proper government action will not be by years end. As it has though, the global markets will continue in their indifferent churning ways and in the end we will be preparing for the next downturn. We have gotten past many different pandemics before.

In the end, this too shall pass.

67,2020-05-13,feelthebenn,1,Why I think the market is headed downward. Would love to hear some counterpoints,"I sold about half of my portfolio in early/mid February, a move that saved me a bit of pain. I didn’t sell it all, and still haven’t, because I’m young and trying to build good habits by investing long-term and avoiding trading. However, I’m considering selling the rest of my long positions now, because the market simply seems to be defying reality. I know a lot of posts like this have been made, but I haven’t seen a super in-depth analysis of anyone’s thought process yet. If I missed it, I apologize.

**Coronavirus is not going away, and will continue to destroy the economy**

* We have flattened the curve, but we have not dramatically decreased the number of new cases. After increasing exponentially throughout the month of March, new cases [peaked](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-cases-covid-19?country=USA) at the beginning of April, plateauing at about 25,000-35,000 new cases daily. Since then, new cases have trended down, but not dramatically. We are still reporting 18,000-25,000 new cases daily. This is a bad sign. Social distancing orders have clearly stopped the exponential phase of the virus, but they haven’t been able to fully contain it. Which brings me to my next point.

* Social distancing cannot last forever. It has been deteriorating for a while, and will continue to do so. People are able to tolerate staying at home and avoiding activity for a few weeks. After a few weeks, though, they get antsy. The biggest problem with social distancing is that when it’s successful, it will have felt like a waste of time. People see that a few hundred, maybe a couple thousand people have died from coronavirus in their state. That’s obviously bad, but is it really worth destroying small businesses and sending unemployment skyrocketing? Why should I be staying inside when this coronavirus isn’t that dangerous anyway? This seems like an overreaction, they will think. The problem is that the reason coronavirus isn’t killing huge numbers of people, is because stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures have prevented it from doing so. If the cure is successful, it will have seemed unnecessary. 

* Political pressure builds on governors to ease lockdowns. We have seen this in Georgia, Texas, Florida, and many other states. It is political suicide to maintain lockdowns perpetually; governors are forced to at the very least loosen them. Even if governors maintain strict social distancing orders, people will begin to violate them more and more as they grow impatient. This is borne out in phone data, which [shows](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/01/849161820/mobile-phone-data-show-more-americans-are-leaving-their-homes-despite-orders) people have begun to spend less time at home recently. 

* It is clear that people social distancing autonomously as well as stay-at-home orders are what decreased the virus’ R0 and stopped the exponential phase in early April. As people begin to take more risks and as social distancing measures are lifted, it seems obvious to me that the R0 will increase. Even a small change in R0 has an enormous effect on the course of the virus. If decreased social distancing raises R0 from 0.95 to 1.2, the virus goes from dying out to growing exponentially. I see almost no way that the US doesn’t begin to see an increase in the number of new cases daily over the next month or two, given that our current measures are having a disappointingly small effect and that these measures will only become weaker as time goes on.

* It seems obvious to me that we are headed for a return to the exponential stage relatively soon. This second wave makes logical sense, and [appeared](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif) during the 1918 flu pandemic. If anyone can provide a counterargument, I would love to hear it. 

* Now, some of you might say that this is actually a good thing, because coronavirus really isn’t that dangerous, so the young and healthy should get back to work. There are problems with this. The [New York antibody test](https://www.livescience.com/covid-antibody-test-results-new-york-test.html) suggested an infection fatality rate of about 0.5%. This has two big implications. Firstly, the virus is less deadly than we initially thought. However, it isn’t drastically less deadly. If 250 million Americans contract the virus and 0.5% of them die, that’s about 1.3 million dead people. That is a lot of people. I know some people believed that the virus was far less deadly than we thought, with an IFR of .1% or something, but that unfortunately isn’t true. Secondly, this study implies that there is no degree of herd immunity in the United States yet. Some coronavirus optimists have suggested that a large portion of the US may already be infected. It is certainly true that there are more people who have had it than our official case numbers indicate. But if we divide our 83,000 deaths by this 0.5% death rate, we get 17 million cases--a lot, to be sure, but only about 5% of the US population. If R0 is 1.5, the inflection point will come when 33% of the population is infected; if it is 2, 50% must be infected.

* This post is way longer than I intended it to be. My basic point is that the coronavirus outbreak will worsen. As a result of this, our economy will continue to hobble along at reduced capacity for far longer than anticipated. We can’t just go back to normal as long as COVID threatens us. [More than half](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/upshot/pandemic-economy-government-orders.html?rref=upshot&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=The%20Upshot&amp;pgtype=Multimedia) of people would not eat at a restaurant, go to a mall, or ride an airplane. The phrase I’ve heard most these past few weeks is “the stock market is not the economy.” That is true, but the stock market does not exist in a vacuum. It is tied to fundamentals, and as the fundamentals worsen, the stock market will go down. I expect a major drawdown to begin sometime in the next month or two. I don’t know how long the market can stay irrational. In the interest of space, I cut out my thoughts on the connection between a worsening outbreak and the economy and the market, so the lack of analysis on that is intentional, not an oversight. If people disagree with this, I would love to hear so I can confront flaws in my thinking.

TL;DR The market will go down, unless I'm wrong, in which case it will go up instead"
68,2020-05-12,Saturnvistas,1,Scandinavian/Nordic Amazon,"The case for shorting Scandinavian retail companies when Amazon finally moves into the Scandinavian/Nordic market. 

Amazon is barely active in Scandinavia but it's just a matter of time before they will go full force. They have already shown interest, they built 3 big AWS data centers in Sweden and started with some logistic centers outside Stockholm. Amazon's job listing in the region has also increased.

69,2020-05-11,StoicGrowth,1,"Just a few words about ""smart money"", don't mind me","In every universe known to man, ""smart money"" wins because smart money *is **what moves** the markets*, not in words like the news or politicians, but in actual mass, worth, mathematical impact. It's a machine, sort of a hydra, so many heads they might as well be hair. I don't know who said that the kinetics of smart money are basically gravity in the universe of *valuation*. Not just stock markets, valuation entirely, because the very idea of value tends to be subjective like that. It's gravity, it's everywhere, it pulls every atom in the universe. There's no ""counter"" force, it doesn't exist. There's no ""shield"" either, it just is.

That's why you never defy smart money, if you know where it stands (that's the hard part, and no it's not a ""secret""). That would be the equivalent of jumping over a cliff to prove something (*spoile... oh come on.*). That's why contrarians still hedge, on the side of caution. That's why people still buy houses or gold or invest in education even at the worst of depressions —if they can, after they feed themselves. That's why governments know they can pile debt like there's no tomorrow because effectively, if smart money says ""there's no tomorrow"" then the sun don't shine that day and it's all there is to it. Netflix still rolls as usual (arguably more, even). That's why wages can't rise too high but bonuses will.

It's the ultimate absurdity of it all: we can say just about anything like kids do in games, and it happens. We just seldom do, not really, not like that. *End wars?* Done. *End hunger?* Done. End disease? Nope, nobody can do that, so collectively saying so doesn't matter. When can vaccinate, but then it's a conspiracy to sell Windows. This absurd insight is one of magnitude, not a generalization that mankind could do wonders by wishful thinking, make magical unicorns self-multiply every 2 hours (that's not absurd but nonsensical). 

But neither wars nor hunger will end, today or tomorrow, because we won't say so, not really, not like that. Because it's still absurd, even if it's not nonsensical, if it has meaning.

So let's revel on what we said already, what we have right now. It's already quite a lot, when you stop and ponder versus anyone just a century ago and forever before. And let's push the envelope where it matters, baby steps.

World finance is a big *non*-zero sum game, it's literally the blood of modern times, because we say so, and until we make it otherwise (for instance back to a zero-sum game, where your loss is definitely the only way to my win), and shoot everybody else in the foot and heart, like madmen. I'm all for positive pacific revolutions, whether *occupying the 1% of bitcoins in Spring for global healthcare* or whatever. But don't fight smart money. Don't think anyone can wish gravity away like it's some sort of choice, like it's anyone decision. It's not, not really, not like that. 

Lean into it. Learn to appreciate what it means to have smart money versus every single last century in history for the real masses of people (because an alternative world without smart money but without the past is unknown as of yet). You find it awful that it keeps some parts of the world in poverty, but it's so much more complex. It's by definition not a first-world problem and can't be wished away by first-world solutions. Scholars can't solve this one from the comfort of an office in Penn because they're not *over there* changing behaviors.

On the field, it's people like you and me just taking the money because they can, just because we say so. Spend a month, a year in Africa, in Asia, and not just the fancy cities. See the life of ""you's"", there, relatively. See why things are the way they are, and how they could be much worse, and how it's not all related to some wall in some street whether German or American. Removing the blood system for everyone on Earth would be a critical suicide case of ""this is why we can't have nice things"", because some would have drunk the blood when they were not supposed to (*see how all the common imagery fits nicely together? Not me, not my doing, for truth is built-in language so often...*) 

Responsibilities must be enforced however, individually as in any organization, and that is a topic for this century due to inter-dependency.

In principle, smart money is everything but ""people"": smart money never was ""someone"" or ""someone-s"". It's a collective, like the invisible hand of Adam Smith, but less magic, many more hands, and one shady legal persona nonetheless. And hands do *transfers of money*... yes, *that* drift (implicitely so, to keep it civil below). Smart money is why this world can breathe even when it physically can't, as 60% of the world's population is at home and yet the world still keeps happening to a shockingly good extent (all things considered). At any other time in history, it would not have been an option (it is still not, as we speak, in many countries, because people would simply starve in weeks), and that is a testament of some economic might, that I want to consider globally as a species (think less geopolitics and more Kardashiev/Sagan in this perspetive), whatever we politically feel about it, whatever we'd say in a debate of ""should we and how?"", this episode 2020 is definitely a major feat of the human race.

And that was in urgency. Now give it 10 years, and if we do any sort of decent preparation, in terms of infrastructure and knowledge, we could pretty much operate the world while most of us work from home, given the level of technical progress we've achieved. This was the promise of mechanization and machinery all along, right? To be able to just press a button? And wherever that button is, post-internet? (*self-censored bad javascript joke*)

But this event is also proof that some of the richest countries on Earth right now ""can't have too many nice things"" because their economy is profiled in such a way that does not allow for it, even if (some of) their life depended on it (quite literally so I'm afraid). It's a choice, at the very least, to continue in that direction, or not, and the reasons, the hierarchy of values that defines each of us individual and collectively, is much wider than this topic. But ""smart money"" **will be right about it however**, because smart money is what will make ""it"" happen, whatever it [the next new world] happens to be. You don't want to be on the wrong side of that, it's a bit of a historical fork. 

You also should know that in consumerism, voting with a wallet is what ultimately drives smart money;  
that in investing your wallet has 100× more impact on your values regarding the world and moving needles;  
and that in post-internet times your very behavior online is part of that equation as the human kind gets abstracted in big data. Whether your behavior (bots/AI of tomorrow) or your browser history (rest assured that sentiment is meaningful however, it's normal to visit things we have negative feeling about, know thy enemy and all that). The world is nothing but what we make of it, online or not.

Now to address the elephant in any room with ""smart money"".

There never was any formal conspiracy, it's all an informal convergence of interests, no more no less. (not a cataclysm yet, no joke either). Face it, Adam Smith won that battle, because the thing is now so massive and so complex that nobody has a god damn switch to really move it at will (those who do are regulated but in the grander scheme of things... nobody can give ±100% to the S&amp;P over the next 10 years, nobody has that kind of power anymore even as a collective. Kings are truly gone). The invisible hand was a self-fulfilling prophecy, is all. 

It's a form of collective agreement (true, *though distorted*) quite special to our modern era. It's sensible because it empirically prevents upheaval, promotes growth, progress and stability, *within the context of its existence* (no way to affirm this would be true in all external conditions). We learned however that it's important to promote a system that doesn't generate as much inequity, that's apparently the only real cataclysmic part everyone and their mother should be worried about (because it tends to be proven in other sciences that it decreases life expectancy globally, and a slew of other social problems do worse). 

Smart money is all these things, and more. You may have a specific definition today— I'm eager to read some in the commentary —but smart money is a more general idea that predates and outlasts most particular historical snapshots we use to describe it (cue rolling eyes on claims that ""it's all because the Fed"" or this person did this thing with gold... *it matters, a lot* in the short-term, don't miskate my words; but it matters not when you try to navigate this historical period versus *other* historical periods, not knowing what this one actually is but in hindsight, thus the ultimate significance of events).

You don't know that gold will triple in the next 8 years and 10× before 2040.   
You don't know that my predictions are as good as my love for science-fiction (definitely lacking and I blame time). Our knowledge will always be partial, so it's sane to focus on what we know. Smart money knows:

- Reforms will be needed fast before more dire circumstances remove the ""business as usual"" card from the hands of decision-makers (it will happen, whether a really bad virus, a war, natural catastrophe, terrorism.. still 80+ years to go for this century, we've not completed 20% so far). So we have 6-12 years to do the job give or take, and the best will be there by 2023. 

- UBI is basically the conclusion of the Tobin tax that never was, and seems like a decent approach to me (but muh opinion, who cares), if it can be indexed to the financials of its region (fact however, inflation is the big enemy of redistribution, more so than otherwise). I have no idea what smart money thinks, no one does remember, but it's already what European countries do in monetary mass redistributed /GDP per persona, only framed in a much more ""universal"" fin/math way indeed.

- Pushing on virtualization and ""remoting"" humans to increase worldwide collaboration is also a great avenue of improvement (for quality of life, anti-fragility of society, etc) that's been demonstrated as totally feasible within 5 years or so. Collaterally automating big logistics/production centers with non-biologicals (robots, self-sanitizing buildings, etc) is a strong path to a few decades of economic prosperity as we transform infrastructure and eliminate all menial jobs of the 20th century and transition to the next paradigm. Not what I intend to discuss here, it's another topic, but it's really just the right part of the S-curve for this domain now 80 years in the making (see, again, sci-fi for references, if Boston Dynamics isn't enough).

So, smart money. Talking to you know, whether a cog, a hair in the machine, or more figures than my hand has fingers happening to read by. Know what you built, others before you, previous versions of the machine; and know what's left to do, find the best makers of that, and invest on. 

The rest of us, the ""less smart"" I guess, it's pop-corn time for the next decade. Please mind the reapers though, they announce fortunes to be made but tend to leave a lasting mark if you touch one. Happy r/investing.

(but I had moved almost all-in cash *before* the pandemic hit, so I guess I'm not that un-smart after all, I suppose I'm not alone sitting this one out. Such is my skin in the game if you want to weigh this view, as I'm really not just talking). Speaking of which, gotta head back to work.

* Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction
* How to **not** make a buying decision
* Why covid is not that horrible

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Why we won't see a new low in the stock market**

Will start of by saying that comparing this crisis with 08/09 doesn't work due to the key difference of the core problem. In 08/09 it was a core problem of the financial system, now its a virus. The business were working just fine before covid.

We will not see a new low due to a platitude of reasons. We have the Fed which backstops everything, we have unemployed people getting more money now than when they were working and basing on recent examples we also have a lot of people that can't wait to go out and do stuff. See Disney park in Shanghai being instantly sold out. See Carnival cruises getting booked like crazy and a plethora of other examples where we see people don't care about covid.

The market is driven by the Tech companies right now which we see that are doing really good in this environment.  The slow and steady re-opening will bring business to every other company affected. This is a strong argument for the stock market to go up. Gas will be needed for cars so companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell will see their demands go higher, pushing the oil price higher and therefore the revenue will be higher.

We will see a bounce back for companies like Realty Income or Simon property Group once people will slowly start to use gyms, go to the malls, getting their jobs back and brining back the normal flow for rent payments.

We will see companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T push higher due to 5G implementation.

We are already seeing healthcare companies going higher and higher based on the situation. A lot of them will start going back down but the big dogs will stay where they are or will push higher.

And so on.. every single industry has strong arguments to go higher and higher by slowly re-opening the country and things normalizing.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction**

&amp;#x200B;

Here we need to talk about the elephant in the room, covid. The first and the most obvious reason would be covid doing a spanish flu style rebound and start being a real killer. This is not something that we can debate since its unlikely to happen just because a different disease did this 100 years ago.

Going with more real possibilities, the Fed could be a real reason if they start backing off to soon. I don't expect this to happen but its a possibility and we should take it into account.

The majority of people actually changing spending habits, being fearful of leaving the house or going to work.

The news. Now this one is a big one. If we take a deep dive into audience data for TV news we see that not a lot of people are actually watching them. This is also valid for Twitter, although the margins are a lot tighter. In a theoretical world this would mean that the news are not a huge influence. But they are. Not the TV news. Does are just for ratings. Almost everybody who has a decent chunk of money in the stock market does at least 1% research on their own. Now we expect the data to be bad, that's why we don't see the market going down. But if the data changes and starts coming worse than expected the market will react in accordance. A perfect example is the unemployment news. Right now we all expected it that's why the market didn't go down, but if this situation keeps going and once the country is open the numbers aren't correcting themselves its going to be a huge problem.

Inflation/Deflation numbers can also be a big influence. This is the only topic that I have an understanding for my own but a limited capacity to actually go in depth and explain if for someone else so I will just mention it and leave it here.

China trade war. If Trump cancels the agreement we are going to see a reaction for sure in the market, the only question remaining is how bad?  

&amp;#x200B;

**3. How to not make a buying decision**

&amp;#x200B;

Do not base you decision of buying a company, or anything for that matter on what some random persons says on reddit. Never! Even if that person is a super expert and he wants all the good in the world for you, once you buy something that you, personal have no clue about its going to be a source of anxiety because you don't know what happens. Its not worth it.

Do not buy just because FOMO (fear of missing out) - if you do not feel comfortable with the price before you buy, you will definitely not be comfortable after. Just be calm, controlled, do you research, make up your mind about a price, wait for it.

Do your due diligence. No matter the company. You want to buy Apple? Check their balance sheet, check their prospects, look at their future. Ask yourself questions: Will people need this company in 10 years? Will people still buy their products? Can they adapt to new markets? Can they grow their business? Make a list before looking at any company with the things that you care about, note your responses before investigating and then see if its a right fit for you.

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Why covid is not that horrible?**



Ah.. the downvoter topic. I was thinking not tackling this one but, whatever.. my opinion.

I want to start out by looking at Sweden. Do not start comparing the total numbers with the US because that is ridiculous, their population is much smaller.  Start comparing the per million numbers, there things get interesting: Deaths per million: 319 (USA is at 242), Cases per million: 2567 (USA has 4070), test per million: 14704 (USA has 26943). You can see the similarities. They have half the cases but also half the testing power so we can make an educated assumption and put them close to USA.

Sweden measures when comparing with USA are zero. They have very limited measures in place yet the case numbers evolves really similar. This is a case as to why the country should open.

The death rate is 100% overblown. Recent studies in Europe but also in USA start showing that the rate of infection is 20 to 100 higher than the official numbers. Even if we go with the low number of 20, that would put USA cases at over 25 million. This again proves that Covid is not that bad as we expected.

The majority of people that died (over 90%) are people over 65 with underlying conditions. Healthy, young people are just not affected nearly as bad some predicted. 

Do not interpret my words on this topic as taking in lightly. I am not. But in a healthy society we need to be able to debate both sides of the story and not only the one pushed in the media.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, hope you have a nice day/night (depending where you live) and thank you, danke, merci, multumesc, kiitos, efharisto!"

At the end of the day, like I mentioned in all my other DDs, this is just all the information I dug to find with legitimate &amp; cited sources. I do this so you can make the best possible well informed decision before you decide to make a purchase. 

As I've mentioned to most of you, I'm well into the cancer companies/industry because of my father's illness. This ""Liquid Biopsy"" is seriously amazing and as soon as it catches on it will tap into a market that other companies aren't in.

Like I mentioned in this post, with traditional biopsies, it is invasive &amp; depending on the location of the tumor, some patients can't even get a biopsy. Plus with a traditional biopsy, you run the risk of aggravating the cancer &amp; accelerating it's growth. With the liquid biopsy, it changes all that and it allows for the oncologist to plan the best form of treatment since they'll have all the knowledge possible of the cancer prior to making the treatment plan.

Anyways, hope this DD can provide you the best knowledge possible so you can make a well informed decision before deciding to purchase stocks. I have tomorrow and Sunday off of work, so I will be posting more DDs on companies I feel will have positive growth this year.

Take care Everyone &amp; have a good weekend!! :)"
72,2020-05-05,MinerExperience,1,A Placer Gold Conundrum," ​I find myself in the unusual situation of advocating for a gold project that, as a client’s representative, I would recommend my client not invest in! A real conundrum. Let me explain.

  
Full disclosure, I have a pecuniary interest in the financing of this project. If the project gets financed, I get paid for work already done and will have an income stream into the future. If not, I must write it off to experience.  


In November last year, I was approached by a loud American from Colorado, who was looking for help in raising finance for his placer gold project. For those that have the Discovery Channel, it is the type of mine featured in the series Gold Rush.  


I initially dismissed his approach believing him to be a scammer trying to extract money out of me. But he persisted and I eventually realised that he was genuinely looking for help, not dollars. He had been sending out information to potential investors without gaining any interest. He provided me with the scant few pages that he had been sending out to would-be investors and it became immediately apparent to me, why his efforts were not gaining any traction.  
Long story short, I prepared a 44-page Information Memorandum on the project and a financial model. We began approaching potential investors, attracting some interest along the way but, as yet, no offers of funding.  


My client has been a placer gold miner for about 10 years, having operated a mine at Manley Springs, about 85 mi (135 km) out of Fairbanks in Alaska, until the resources on that property were depleted. In the process, he has purchased approximately USD 3.5 M worth of plant and equipment, which will be transferred to the new venture.  


In looking for a new project, he spent USD 3.5 M and acquired 2880 acres (1165 ha) of tenements on the Kahiltna River, approximately 56 miles (90 km) north-north-west of Anchorage, an area that has only seen limited, small-scale mining historically, due to the difficult access to the area up until the 1960s when the George Parkes Highway was constructed. Even now, access to the river is only possible by clearing vegetation from old seismograph tracks, although an airstrip was constructed on one of the southern tenements in the 1990s.  
​  
The tenements: 72 in total, are in two groups, one to the north near Shulin Lake, the other to the south near Black Creek. It is proposed to commence operations on the southern tenements.  


My client is one of life’s Chameleons, able to adapt to changing environments. Because placer mining in that part of the world is seasonal, he spends the rest of the year running a construction business back in Colorado. His background is as an earthmoving plant operator and he has, in the past, worked on some hard rock goldmines.  


On acquiring the Kahiltna River tenements, his experience in the hard rock goldmines gave him enough insight into the way that mines operate, for him to engage a driller to RC drill the first 10 acres (4 ha) that he planned to mine. Whilst the idea was solid, the execution was an unmitigated disaster. What should have been between 500 and 600 data points, ended up being one. Decisions regarding the drilling were left up to the driller who decided that compositing all the samples generated by the 105-hole program into a single sample, was a good idea! That sample yielded 16.32 ounces of gold, which, based on the diameter of the RC hole drilled equated to 0.88 oz/BCY (35.8 g/m3). Certainly, an impressive grade, but lacking in detail about its areal and vertical distribution.  


The grade, though high, is not inconsistent with grades reported historically from the limited workings that were present on the river in the early part of the last century. Allowing for perhaps 20% swell on excavation, grades to a wash plant would potentially be of the order of 0.73 ounces per yard (29.7 g/m3).  


John Beaver Mertie a geologist who spent 30 years mapping Alaska in the early 1900s for the US Geological Survey (USGS), stated in a 1917 publication, that small mining operations were scattered up and down the river.  


In 1907, Mertie reported on a party of four men working a bar near Leslie’s Bar by hand methods who were producing about 2.75 oz/day (86 g). Estimates place their daily movements at around 4 LCY/day, suggesting a grade of around 0.69 oz/LCY (28 g/LCM).  


Mertie also noted placer production from several other sites upstream, such as at Round Bend Bar; just upstream of my clients project, where “about $1500 in gold was rocked out by two men from about 100 yd³” in 1908, indicating a grade of around 0.79 oz/LCY(32 g/LCM), based on the gold price at that time.  


Sholan Bar, near Shulin Lake, was reported by Mertie to have hand mining that had been carried on intermittently for a number of years with “some fairly rich spots”, “particularly on bars projecting into the river at the sharp turns”.  


Mertie also reported that gold was distributed from the mouth of Peter’s Creek downstream to almost the mouth of the river.  


Most tenements that form the project package were pegged between 1974 and 1980. Some of these tenements were leased to various other companies including St Joe Minerals and Alvon.  
St Joe engaged a mining engineer from British Columbia, who collected seven samples, each of 3/8th of a cubic yard (0.287 m3) from the Camp Bench (MC 303145). These samples averaged around 0.03 oz/LCY (1.22 g/m3) but ranged as high as 0.077 oz/LCY (3.13 g/LCM). The gold from this sampling program had a fineness of 871[\[1\]](http://file///C:/Users/nevil/OneDrive/Neville%20Bergin%20and%20Associates%20Pty%20Ltd/MB%20Mining%20Alaska/LinkedIn%20Article.docx#_ftn1).  


Under Alvon’s ownership of the lease, Union Carbide undertook testing near the airstrip (MC 303145) as well as near Black Creek (MC 303259). Alvon also undertook a very small-scale test of 2500 loose cubic yards (LCY) (1912 LCM). This yielded 45 ounces of gold, indicating an average grade of approximately 0.018 oz/LCY (0.73 g/LCM).  


Whilst there have been several sampling programs since the late 1970s, only the work undertaken by St Joe was conducted by knowledgeable placer professionals. To date, no data has been discovered that indicates the exact coordinates that samples were taken from, nor from what depth.  


For the purposes of the financial model, I used the St Joe grade of 0.03 oz/LCY (1.22 g/m3), as this seemed an appropriately conservative approach.  


Work undertaken by other mining companies elsewhere in the state indicates that the successive advance and retreat of glaciers and reworking of the glacial moraine by meltwater has resulted in discrete pay zones being developed within the gravel profile containing significant accumulations of gold, whereas the intervening material can have much lower grades.  


Whilst there appears to be no publicly available geological cross-sections of the Kahiltna River deposits, insight into how successive advances and retreats of glaciers can result in multiple pay zones within a sequence can be gleaned from work undertaken on other placer gold deposits in the state including Little Squaw Creek, in the Chandalar district, which was drilled in 1997 for Daglow Exploration, Inc. and reported in a professional publication of the time titled “Placer Gold and Evaluation, little Squaw and Big Squaw Creek, Chandalar Mining District, Alaska”  
The drilling program undertaken for Daglow, included two lines of RC drilling across the stream channel, Line 2, being 500 feet (152.4 m) downstream of Line 1.  
Line 1 indicated a single pay zone that varied in thickness from 4’ (1.2 m) to 32’ (9.75 m) and at depths from surface varying from 8’ (2.4 m) to 50’ (15.2 m).  
Line 2, on the other hand, indicated two pay zones in two of the holes and a single pay zone in the third. The pay zones varied from 4’ (1.2 m) to 28’ (8.5 m) in thickness again at varying depths.  
The work on Little Squaw Creek also referenced the Carlson &amp; Buckley Shaft, a hand-dug shaft excavated in 1925, approximately 1850 feet (564 m) downstream from Line 2. This reported three pay zones varying in thickness from 5’ (1.5 m) to 9’ (2.7 m) at various depths.  


My subjective examination of the topography of the 72 tenements that make up the Kahiltna River project suggests that perhaps a little over 50% has terrain that has the potential to host placer deposits. These being either abandoned oxbows of the river, current riverbanks/terraces, and terraces of higher drainages. Even at the conservative grade utilised in the financial model, this potentially amounts to a significant amount of gold. At the grades indicated by the RC drilling and JB Mertie’s visits in the early part of the last century, the quantity of gold becomes extremely significant. Although such high grades are likely to be outliers, with reality most probably somewhere between the two.  


Until I started doing work on this project, I had not appreciated how low-cost placer mining was. The breakeven grade on this project is around about 0.003 oz/LCY (0.12 g/m3). I have also learned that those that undertake this type of mining have a different mindset to those of us who have worked for listed mining companies big and small. It has a history of being far more “agricultural” than most hard rock mines, although there are some major equipment suppliers such as MSI Mining Equipment, who supply some sophisticated plant to this sector of the industry. Perhaps fostered by the low breakeven grades, that limit downside risk, there is greater inclination to base decisions on limited information and just “give it a go”, especially as the upside can be spectacular. 

I was once told never to fall in love with the project so much that you could not let it go. Sound advice. However, this project has got under my skin, perhaps because of the amount of time that I have invested in it, but also because it intrigues me and because I would like to bring some of the discipline and procedure from my experience to bear on it.

As I indicated at the beginning of this article, if I were acting for a client, I would certainly advise them not to invest due to the lack of the level of data that we expect to see in the mainstream industry. However, understanding now, how placer gold miners think, there is certainly enough information on which to “give it a go”.

If this article has sparked even a modicum of interest in finding out more about the Kahiltna River Gold Project, then please PM me.

​1 Fineness is a measure of the content of pure gold as a proportion to the total weight which includes alloying base metals and any impurities. Fineness is often expressed as parts per 1000. Thus, a fineness of 850 means that the nugget or doré contains 850 ÷ 1000 = 0.85 or 85% pure gold."
73,2020-05-04,SafetyDictator,1,Rate these 2 Portfolios: Actively managed vs Passively managed,"Hello all, I would appreciate any of your inputs. I've done quite a bit of research and arrived at these portfolios for long term dividend growth + yield.  I have a pretty long investment time horizon so there's essentially no bonds, and I live in Canada, which is why my portfolio is Canadian focused.

Due to recent events and quantitative easing by the Fed, I am worried about the stock market trading sideways for a long time similar to the Nikkei 225 in Japan. Therefore, I believe a dividend/yield focused portfolio provides a steady source of growth in the absence of capital appreciation.

One of these portfolios seeks higher yield using actively managed strategies (such as artificial intelligence via HAL.TO), while the other portfolio seeks to minimize MER. I will list them below and briefly explain my rationale:

# Portfolio 1 (Actively Managed):

* CI First Asset Canadian REIT ETF (RIT.TO) - 40% allocation
* Horizons Canadian Active Dividend ETF (HAL.TO) - 30% allocation
* BMO Global High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.717%

**Rationale:** 

I know the management fee is high, but if you check the annualized performance since inception of RIT.TO and HAL.TO, they are 9.20% and 7.27%. I know passive management generally beats active management, but in this case it might be different. Real estate is generally a sector where active management can provide more value than in stocks, due to more inefficiencies to exploit. HAL.TO uses artificial intelligence and big data to predict dividend yield and sustainability, which seemed to have provided superior returns so far. 

Plus, the real estate market might be in big trouble, so the active management of RIT.TO might be useful to implement proactive/defensive plays. It's also interesting HAL.TO positioned it's allocation to utilities as its top sector allocation, since utilities tend to perform the best during a market downturn.

In terms of BMO covered call ETF, I see it as a pseudo-bond that provides good yield even in economic downturns. I chose ZWG.TO because it is geographically diversified compared to the other BMO covered call ETFs. I've heard good things about ZWH.TO (USA only), because the covered call premiums are higher in the US (though ZWG.TO is almost 60% US). 

# Portfolio 2 (Passively Managed):

* Vanguard FTSE Canadian Capped REIT Index ETF (VRE.TO) - 40% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDIV.TO) - 30% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Global Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.258%

**Rationale:**

These are the lowest fee ETFs I could find compared to similar competition. I personally really like REITs which is why I am so heavy in real estate, and VRE.TO is the cheapest compared to other REIT etfs like XRE.TO and ZRE.TO. I also like the MSCI High Dividend Yield Indices that XDIV.TO and XDG.TO tracks, which uses smart beta methods (Tangerine's high dividend mutual fund also tracks this index). 

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate all feedback, looking forward to learn from you all, thanks."
74,2020-05-04,pingnpong,1,daily swims during crash/historical data,"I'm sure the landslide from Feb 20 - March 23 this year is still fresh in everyone's mind. 

I sat that one out because i was still working during that time and knew even less about stocks/trading than I do now(still new to this and learning), but I saw the profits you can make by buying puts at the right time. 

one of the strategy I saw some people using during that time was buy puts on the green days and take profit immediately the day after. I still remember the market was ""predicable"" in the sense that everybody know it's crashing, and those greens days are almost guarantee to be followed with bloodbath red days after. That pattern repeated over the course of bit over 3 weeks.

Now my question is : is this a common characteristic for a steep market drop? I'm only taking about the big plunge here. In the past historical charts when you see the market take a nose dive, it's basically a straight line heading down, but I can imagine it wont red days for weeks straight, it will probably have some strong green days mix with every 2/4 red days? 

anybody here is old/experienced enough to remember the crash during 2008? or even black monday back in 1987 ?

75,2020-05-03,rennocsemaj,1,Message to other new investors,"Hello, as a beginner investor myself i thought this message might make you think before making rash decisions you may later go on to regret.

About 2 weeks ago while the markets were down i thought great, what a good time to invest. So i put some of my money onto a trading212 account and without even doing any research I bought contracts on crude oil without even knowing what the contracts meant. I did however, thanks to a reddit post realise my stupidity and got out of that quickly. 

I then thought right well i'll do some research and then re-evaluate. Now in my mind at this point doing research was simply browsing reddit, looking at what the general consensus was, seeing others portfolios and going off analysts. However, after doing that my portfolio was around 25 stocks big not even checking if they were overvalued or had a large amount of debt i just went for them because they were good companies imo. People commented say that this was way to many for a low amount of investment money (£5000). So i sold all the ones i could but i had to leave some that were in the red hoping that they recover.

This is where i really did my research. I wanted to invest long term so i was looking for profitable companies, with a decent dividend and large growth potential and preferably little debt. For me I much prefer comparing number but i found flicking through webpage to webpage was hard to keep up with especially when comparing multiple companies. So i decided to create my own google sheets page, which imported companies data depending on the ticker and i did calculations to get other values (this took some time). This allowed me to get a much clearer picture of what the different companies futures were like. It looks at their margins, ROI, ROE, ROA, EPS (tts), 1 year EPS, D/E, trailing P/E, forward P/E, P/B, P/C, P/FCF, PEG, dividend information, stock information as well as graphs to see which way the market is going (roughly, i know it unpredictable). I also looked and thought about the future of the companies and how it might affect their price e.g. Sony and Microsoft with the new generation consoles.

After doing all this i have to say i found myself addicted to analysis, i **LOVE** it, i've managed to narrow down my stocks to 9 so they are easily trackable and i only plan to invest small amounts at a time (around £500 a week) until a clearer idea can be gathered amount the current market.

I would encourage any of you new investors to do the same, it may take some time but it is worth it in the long run. You will also feel much more confident in your picks once you have done this.

Stock Picks:

VUSA - 25%

MA - 10%

JNJ - 10%

MSFT - 10%

CSCO - 10%

ABBV - 10%

PEP - 10%

LOW - 10%

RTX - 5%

(There are others that i'm watching that are currently overvalued imo so waiting to see what the month brings)

Please let me know what you think, if you have any questions or have any advice for me.

Thanks!:):)"
76,2020-05-02,speaknovel,5,1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments going into the COVID-19 crises.,"I think a big assumption in the V-shaped recovery theory is that the U.S. economy was relatively healthy going into the crises. And that once demand returns to normal, businesses will continue to post record high profits. 

This idea couldn't be farther from the truth. [Data published in the WSJ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/coronavirus-markets-economy-corporate-debt/) on March 10, 2020 showed that: 

* 1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments before the COVID-19 crises. 
* In the first half of 2019, 40% of all leveraged loans went to companies with a debt-to-earnings ratio of 6:1 or higher. 
* [the IMF conducted a stress test](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/investing/corporate-debt-coronavirus/index.html) that showed an economic crises half the size of 2008 would put 40% of corporate debt at risk of default in the 8 of the largest world economies.

I find it very odd that stories like these were EVERYWHERE in March, 2020. Then as stocks began to skyrocket and firms started making back losses, they practically vanished from the media. 

If you are comfortable with these debt levels and believe we can keep increasing debt without a market contraction, then by all means continue to invest. Just wanted to get the information out since I haven't see much of this lately."
