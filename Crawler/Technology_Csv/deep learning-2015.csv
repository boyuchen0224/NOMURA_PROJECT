I've been looking around about infos on this topic for a while here and in other subs. Trying again.

Lurking on the web, I've found a guy claiming to be able forecast with a really good accuracy if the brent oil price will go up or down in the next x H1/M15 bars thanks to deep learning algos.

He sells an indicator (which I won't link even if you request it and which is very expensive) adaptable for basically any platform. My question is about this indicator.

I've seen it and it looks good. I've asked to watch it live through a remote control software called TeamViewer and the guy traded live with it in front of me. I still didn't trust it (maybe a programmer can ""edit"" the video-streaming?) so I just opened my mt4 platform whilst he was streaming the screen and the prices were real, almost the same.

Which -not legit- tricks to predict the market prices could have he been using?

He gave me a free 3-days trial version of it in order to test it, unfortunately without source file; how can I test it further to see if it plays ""right""? Which things should I take into account? And what are the no-no signs I should be aware of?"
