0,2015-01-15,HearToLearn,3,How can I find and track companies that are working on Virtual Reality? Ideally ones that are pre-seed or have just received seed funding.,"Strong belief in future of VR as disruptive technology. Looking to really immerse myself in the space and learn about all the startups out there, as there are so many interesting uses for VR that just about anything seems possible.

I have been scouring news articles and blogs, but this is very time consuming and I'm wondering if there is some aggregator out there I should use. Thanks in advace."
1,2015-03-19,JediAmerican,0,Is Virtual Reality the next big investment for gaming?,"I have had a friend tell me for several months that the next big push for gaming is going to be VR.  Anybody have an opinion on the validity of this?  If so, are there any companies I should keep my eye on for long term investments as this progresses?"
2,2015-04-29,theonly101,15,Let's talk about GPRO.,"My last post about GPRO for reference: http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2ypv72/gpro_lets_hear_it/cpbxujm

- Q1 Non-GAAP EPS .24 vs .18 estimated(up 140% yoy)

- Q1 Revenue 363mm vs 340mm estimated (54% yoy)

- Q1 Gross Margins 45.2% vs 41.1% last year. Keep in mind Apple has 40% gross margins. This company has insane pricing power.

- Q2 EPS guidance .24-.26 vs .16 estimated (up 150% yoy)

- Q2 Revenue guidance 380-400mm vs 334mm estimated (up 59% yoy)

- Entering VR space with acquisition of Kolor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMBDA-Our4w&amp;feature=youtu.be (need Chrome)

- Video may be hinting at their own spherical camera and management on conference call thinks they can be a leader in the area 

- Management did not see any pricing pressure

- International expansion is heating up (50% of revenue currently compared to 47% last year)

- ~40% short float
 
- Moat is growing. Media side of company is beginning to take shape. HeroCast can allow them to enter space quickly

- Near 500mm of cash (about 1/12 of Market Cap; no debt on company)

- PE is reasonable given current growth estimates

Things to consider:

- Limited visibility in their ability to monetize media content
- Upgrade cycles - how long are they? 

Always do your own due diligence, but the future seems bright for GPRO. What are your thoughts?

Shares are up ~10% after hours. I am bullish."
3,2015-05-09,[deleted],0,Thoughts on OCLS (Oculus Rift VR)?,"(OCLS) Oculus announced their consumer model virtual reality headset to release in early 2016.  
Stock price is low, and news hint that they're going to be competing stronger in the coming year."
4,2015-07-29,GumbaOi,1,Investing in Virtual Reality?,"What do you guys think about investing in the virtual reality space?  
I know companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Sony have all acquired or been working on Virtual Reality Hardware, but has anyone thought about other investing avenues for VR? Small software/hardware companies? The components that go into making headsets?  
But also what do you guys think about the VR industry in general? Any investing opportunity, too early, anything else? I'm an engineer myself and VR has me incredibly intrigued and excited!"
5,2015-07-17,Witcrew,0,Facebook. It's not too late,"$93 is still cheap. They will be the leaders of VR and look to establish their own marketplace to compete with Amazon. Let me remind you people don't log into Amazon on their phones, they log into FB."
6,2015-07-13,ToddMcNab,2,Let's talk about Virtual Reality and investments in lieu of the upcoming VR explosion.,"Have any of you thought about investing in the various companies that are creating VR technology. Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, Microsoft Hololens, etc. This technology is obviously going to rewrite gaming and entertainment forever. I can't even fathom playing GTA with a headset on, or feeling like I'm at a basketball game in the front row, etc. So that said, who and when will you invest in and why?"
7,2015-08-06,Squishy_Vengence,6,"If I want to invest in the Sony PS4 ahead of the morpheus launch, but I don't believe in Sony as a company do I have any options? Is their a publicly traded vendor they are using for the morpheus?","I think that VR is going to be HUGE, but I think Sony's other divisions will drag down the stock.

Edit:  There"
8,2015-08-01,wtf_rainbows,3,What companies will rise together with VR?,"I'm confident in VR as ""the next big thing"" and I would like your opinion on what type of (or specific) companies that will profit from the potential rise of VR"
9,2015-09-14,UteRaptor,1,Advice for stock purchases - check on a quarterly basis,"I asked on the daily advice thread, however doesn't seem to be too much traffic or I am posting in the wrong area.

I'll be 30 next year and my wife and I make enough to not worry too much. We have a house and we are in debt 180K with 70K paid off. I am completely happy with volatility. We have no other debt (car or student loans). The money I invest will be 11K (two roths every year) and will never need to touch it. I do NOT want to vanguard or target fund this money as our maxed 401ks are doing this already. I will check these accounts maybe every 3 months? I'm specifically interested in dividend and long term for example maybe P&amp;G type stocks or RDS (although oil I feel will eventually phase out, but i'm an idiot in that sector). I'm also very interested in upcoming technologies including VR and robotics. Sorry for the text. Thank you for your time.
Also if you would like to comment on my other pitiful holdings. I'd be happy to listen. BMY (6 years now), PBR (3 years now feel free to give me shit will probably sell and write off this year) BCS (2 years now, dividend is fine) IT (less than a year, my friend works here and I missed regeneron)"
10,2015-09-13,BloodInOurWells,4,Investing in VR technology: who's gonna jump in the bandwagon?,"Though i enjoy my gaming and ""gadgeting"" i'm not extremely tech-savy. I think, however, that virtual reality hardware (VR headsets) demand will experience a very interesting growth in the medium term, lets say 5 years.

Oculus VR may be the most talked about at the moment, but i'm very interested in the Morpheus headset by Sony: i'm guessing the ps4 users won't hesitate much in buying.

Which companies you think will become the most popular manufacturers? Where are you aiming your money at?

11,2015-10-22,mcafc,1,Opinions on Nvidia?,"Thinking about going long on Nvidia. It has been growing fairly steadily(a couple down years, but large growth this year). It seems like they could be big with VR and cars. What do you guys think? I'm fairly new to investing, and looking at a few smaller companies to go long on.

Also, as a totally unrelated question(I don't want to spam posts) what do you guys think are the best quantitative indicators of whether a stock is a good buy? I look at earnings per share, growth, and profit.

Edit: Just to add in, I know their products are top notch. I have owned 3 Nvidia GPUs and all worked exceedingly well. Also, with the distinct possibility of AMD dropping out or even being bought by Nvidia, it seems they will have less competition as time goes on."

14,2015-11-20,vincefutr23,1,Thoughts on VUZI?,"Rallying recently. Its positioned in a trendy area (AR/VR), but its products, revenue seems awful. Thoughts on the current valuation? Is it the closest thing you can get to a pure VR play in the public equity markets? "
15,2015-12-27,NovercaIis,0,Newbie looking to play,"Hello everyone, im a low income student who works for SBUX. Recently I learned I have stocks with SBUX and an account with Fidelity. 
As far as SBUX stocks is concern, I don't need any. I am not touching and will hold onto these unless I see a reason to sell.

But because of this, being a Gamer, PC enthusiast and VR enthusiast I am looking to purchase from AMD and another company in mind.
My question is - should I use Fidelity or can I Robinhood them? I do not know what the fees, cost, pros, cons of Fidelity. Today I learned about Robinhood.

Also, because I am new at this, I was thinking of putting $50 a month into investing. The first $100 probably in ""penny stocks"" so I can learn. I acknowledge I may lose it all, it's a scam, etc.. but it's a learning experience that I think will benefit me. I assume, penny stock is more akin or needs more attention (ala daytrader??) In order to make any profit. Buy at .50 and sell at $1.
How quickly can I buy X Stock and re-sell X stock?

any others tips/suggestion?

I know my long term is to have a short / mid and long term stocks.
Long term being in the realm of tech/pharma
mid being retail/entertainment/food
short - yolo blind bids, things I read / hear on reddit multiple forums.

Am I getting into this foolishly?
Like I said, I am a low income person, I could invest in 50 a month to play around and my guts is telling me to get into the VR related stocks asap"
16,2015-12-06,canoned,74,"Fellow investors, what are you thoughts on investing in VR and augmented reality tech in 2016?","FB and Oculus? Google? Sony? HTC/Samsung? Other players less known?

I've tested several devices - and it feels like the future. I know this is ultra-cheesy. But I honestly think it just... works. It's here. Oculus is astonishing, cheaper Samsung headset is also great even if it's not as mind-blowing as Oculus. Lot's of future and lots of growth."
