 **Bitcoin** 

It’s rumored that institutional investors are accumulating Bitcoin through OTC markets despite bearish market sentiment. Whilst retail investors are panicking, institutional investors are said to be acquiring Bitcoin – an assumption that leaves many wondering as to why markets have not yet shown many signs of recovery when a.k.a smart money is flowing into the space.  

Professional traders and institutional investors are highly cautious about accumulating new assets and are experts at acquiring them without affecting the market. There are a variety of hedge funds that are solely focused on investing in Bitcoin and venture capital funds that have begun to provide the necessary financial support for upcoming startups that have dedicated themselves to building applications and services for the Bitcoin ecosystem.During bear markets, institutional investors prefer bitcoin over altcoins due to positive sentiment and because BTC is the most established cryptocurrency.

The SEC has denied multiple Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications as cryptocurrency enthusiasts eagerly await the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF. Many are betting on the institutionalization of Bitcoin once new yet traditional investment vehicles are made available to investors.

 

**Ripple**

Unlike most decentralized projects, Ripple is focused on connecting banks, payment service providers, digital asset exchanges and corporates through blockchain technology. Although XRP, the cryptocurrency used by Ripple’s xRapid, is accused of being centralized, it remains popular due to the fact that investors recognize the compelling value proposition of connecting existing financial institutions and remittance services using distributed ledger technology.Originally released in 2012, Ripple has managed to build up an extensive list of clientele that consists of public banks, central banks, tech companies and corporations. The value here is the Ripple network that provides a reliable solution to moving assets quickly around the world, which is being utilized by banks to shift money between different foreign countries.

**Ethereum**

By far the most utilized blockchain protocol for businesses to issue their own native digital currency token, Ethereum allows smart contract functionality that has managed to get the attention of large institutions and corporations. Whilst Ethereum is classified as a decentralized project, it has managed to attract companies like Microsoft, Samsung, LG, Intel, AMD, BP and financial institutions like JP Morgan, CME group, Scotiabank and Commerzbank.

Due to the sheer popularity of the project, Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA), consisting of over 300 members, was formed to help connect established organizations with blockchain developers interested in building applications on top of Ethereum.

**Aergo**

An upcoming fourth generation blockchain project that plans to help enterprises make use of distributed ledger technology, Aergo is based on the proprietary software known as Coinstack.

Aergo is a hybrid blockchain that is open to the public and designed to help large-scale enterprises deploy their own preferred blockchain. Renowned VC fund Sequoia Capital, known for focusing on the technology industry and backing Forbes 500 companies, is one of many VC firms investing in Aergo, along with FBG, GBIC, Arrington XRP, Dekrypt, Rockaway, Neo Global and Divergence Digital.The project will help enterprises adopt blockchain technology by making it easy to design and build decentralized applications on private or public chains or a mix of both. Aergo plans to provide Blocko, Korea’s number one blockchain infrastructure provider, with a more decentralized solution to service its existing clients including Shinhan Bank, Samsung, Lotte Card, KRX and the South Korean government.

**OmiseGo**

A decentralized payment solution provider as well as a bank, exchange and blockchain gateway for businesses, OmiseGo was created by parent company Omise, a venture-backed payment service company operating in Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand.Omise is a popular payment gateway solution in Asia, well-established in Thailand and backed by large corporations such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Allianz, Axxa and SCG. The company has been showing impressive growth since its inception in 2013. It’s expected that once OmiseGo is fully operational with its mainnet release, Omise merchants will switch over to the decentralized blockchain network

**Vechain**

A project aiming to disrupt the supply management industry by leveraging a blockchain-based platform that digitizes the supply chain and tackles goods counterfeiting, Vechain is essentially a Blockchain-as-a-Service company that plans to build a trust-free network for businesses to collaborate and track inventory in a decentralized ecosystem.By deploying a public distributed ledger, Vechain hopes to enhance supply chain management by combining the ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** with blockchain technology. Manufacturers can easily track and manage supplies, as all the information is made available on Vechain’s public blockchain. Consumers will also have the ability to determine the quality and authenticity of the products sold. The project has secured a few high-level partnerships with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the government of Gui’an, Shanghai Waigaoqiao’s Direct Imported Goods Sales Centre, DNV GL, BMW and China Unicom.  


**Icon**

A project dedicated to helping enterprises deploy their own distributed ledgers, ICON is an independent chain that connects multiple community sidechains, enabling cross-platform data and value communication.Positioned in South Korea, a country that is considered to be the most crypto friendly nation in Asia, ICON has established a variety of strategic partnerships with large corporations such as Line, Samsung Electronics, Smilegate and SK Planet. The project is diversifying its reach by collaborating with the Korean government on numerous initiatives in the healthcare, education, insurance and customs sectors.Vasilios FilipVasilios Filip got into Bitcoin back in 2015, believing that distributed ledger technology will disrupt traditional financial services and banks. With a background in law and economics, he has since kept his eye on blockchain applications whilst dedicating his time writing about anything crypto-related.

**Viewpoint - Indraprastha Gas Ltd: Well positioned for growth**

· **Strong volume growth tailwinds:** Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) is likely to see volumes continuing to grow in double-digits led by multiple tailwinds. These include favourable economics of CNG/domestic PNG, given their prices are at a steep discount to petrol/domestic LPG prices; the government’s focus on curbing air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) and expansion in new geographical areas (GAs) of Rewari, Karnal and Gurugram. A ban on use of fuel oil and petcoke in the NCR on concerns of rising pollution could add 0.8-1 mmscmd to IGL’s volumes over next 2-3 years, which is not included in our assumption. Overall, we expect the company’s CNG/PNG volumes to clock a CAGR of 11%/15% during FY19-FY21E, driving up total volume to 7.4 mmscmd by FY21E. IGL has pricing power in CNG/domestic PNG, as it is given priority in allocation of cheap domestic gas. Thus, we expect the company to sustain EBITDA margins at Rs. 5.9-6/scm over FY20E-FY21E. IGL’s joint ventures are also performing well, clocking a combined PAT growth of 21% y-o-y in FY2019.

· **Valuation - Maintain Positive view with 10-12% upside:** We have increased our FY2020 and FY2021 standalone earnings estimates for IGL to reflect our assumption of higher volumes (CAGR of 12% versus earlier assumption of 10% CAGR for FY2019-FY21E). We stay positive with regards to strong volume growth prospects that will be supported by robust gas demand led by regulatory push in the NCR to control pollution. Hence, we expect IGL’s earnings to clock a CAGR of 14% during FY2019-FY2021E along with a healthy RoE of 20%. **We maintain our Positive view on IGL and expect a 10-12% upside for the stock from current levels.** At CMP, the stock is trading at 26.5x its FY2020E EPS and 23.1x FY2021E EPS.

· **Key Risks:** Change in domestic gas allocation policy and depreciation of Indian rupee could affect volumes and margins.

**Persistent Systems: Analyst meet update: Ongoing new initiatives to drive growth**

· **Change of guard, new initiatives to drive growth:** The recently-appointed CEO Chris O'Connor has impressed with the company’s progress with addition of new logos, broad technology partnerships and leadership positions in certain industry segments. The CEO also sees an opportunity to improve revenue by higher account management, acquisitions and leveraging the domain expertise for improving revenue from independent software vendors (ISVs) and intellectual property (IP) portfolio. To accelerate revenues growth, the new CEO has laid out some initiatives — cross-selling and up-selling to existing clients, geographical expansion especially in Europe, re-branding, balancing large client accounts and people augmentation to increase re-seller revenues — that seem to have a good chance being successfully executed execution. The management also indicated that it is building certain capabilities within three industries (BFSI, healthcare and lifesciences and industrials).

· **Valuation – Maintain Hold:** The new leadership team requires some time to execute its strategies and the success is yet to reflect in numbers. However, high cash &amp; cash equivalents (25% of market capitalisation) and a reasonable valuation (11.9x of its FY2021E earnings) would shield any downside in stock prices. **Given a lack of growth triggers in the medium term, we maintain our Hold rating on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 720.**

· **Key Risks:** Any slowdown in non-IoT revenues/delay in product launches/rupee appreciation or/and adverse cross-currency movements would have negative impact on its revenues."

Considerations:

\-Given the genesis of US space-faring, almost all US companies involved in space travel have extensive operations in defense or weapons manufacturing. This presents certain ethical questions that an investor must consider.

\-Space travel is not profitable. Nearly all profits generated by these companies for their efforts in space came directly from government contracts. There are at present very few profit-motivations in outer space. An investor should be aware that the companies above act very differently from the widget manufacturers of Economics 101.

\-The allocation weightings above are based on my own inferences. I considered each company's market cap, as well as the proportion of space-related revenues to all revenues, but ultimately the allocations above are totally made up.

5,2019-08-23,onecentwater,0,Looking for stories about great research,"I was watching the Showtime show Billions last night and in one of the episodes Taylor has a great IoT play, which they found by taking apart a bunch of different devices and comparing the chips inside. There's another scene where Ben Kim finds an alcohol distributor play by tracking airport activity around the major brewing company headquarters. Another story that I find inspiring is that of Lumber Liquidators,  and all of the on the ground work that was done in order to uncover all of that fuckery. I was wondering if anyone knows of any resources where I could find stories about some really good research that was either creative or out of the box like these were? I don't really know what to call this type of research but maybe investigative?

Mainly just looking for entertainment purposes."
6,2019-12-18,Reverenter,1,"""During a gold rush, sell shovels.""","As the old saying goes, the most surefire method of profiting off of an emerging market is to enable others to seize the opportunity rather than trying your luck yourself. So in that spirit, I wanted to open up a discussion about emerging markets and the companies that enable them in hopes that our collective insight will point us towards profitable investments that we can all benefit from. 

Below is a list of the emerging markets that come to my mind. This certainly isn't exhaustive, so input of additional upcoming markets is appreciated. Just to reiterate, the goal isn't to speculate which companies will be the leaders in these areas (ex. NFLX for Streaming Services), but rather identify the companies who are best positioned to enable these industries as a whole (ex. ROKU for Streaming Services):

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) &amp; Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
* 5G Wireless Networks
* SmartHome Devices &amp; IoT
* Meat Substitutes / Lab-grown meat products
* Satellite Internet
* Virtual Reality
* Cloud Infrastructure and Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)
* Drone Technology
* Streaming Services
* Electric Vehicles (EVs)

So what are some other markets you believe will explode over the next several years? What companies do you think are most likely to empower them?"
