0,2018-01-29,btbrian,4,Leaked memo indicates that Trump administration is considering nationalizing 5G mobile network. What does this mean for telecom industry?,"https://www.axios.com/trump-team-debates-nationalizing-5g-network-f1e92a49-60f2-4e3e-acd4-f3eb03d910ff.html 

""The documents say America needs a centralized nationwide 5G network within three years. There'll be a fierce debate inside the Trump administration — and an outcry from the industry — over the next 6-8 months over how such a network is built and paid for. 

Two options laid out by the documents:

* The U.S. government pays for and builds the single network — which would be an unprecedented nationalization of a historically private infrastructure.
* An alternative plan where wireless providers build their own 5G networks that compete with one another — though the document says the downside is it could take longer and cost more. It argues that one of the “pros” of that plan is that it would cause “less commercial disruption” to the wireless industry than the government building a network.""

2,2018-01-02,Premotive,7,How would I invest in 5G being implemented everywhere?,With CES coming up and a lot of talk about 5g becoming a big thing in the future I want to be able to invest in 5G.

3,2018-02-08,askprog,0,Comcast License Issues and Systematic Criminal Fraud Liability,"Comcast is criminally fraudulently billing its customers in order to fluff its company. It does this with smaller fees often but they have failed to understand that even if their support reps are minimum wage their call times are routinely longer than 1 hr. This means not only are you causing your shareholders scaled liability due to criminally fraudulent business practices you arent even making actual money doing that and isnt what would indicate a viable business. Imagine you screw over several hundred thousand people on a broad basis. What are the odds that even one of those people, because almost everybody gets some type of internet or cable service, has the influence to cause the company problems in some way, bring a lawsuit, get the correct investigators attention, etc. What about if everybody who has ever been screwed over by comcast just decides to screw back in the ways they can? I would say, especially given the service % access in washington DC as though it were targeted that it is a high probability.

It is also worth noting regardless of your political stance that several of the properties (media) have drawn the ire of people in positions of power at this point across the isle. Could a company lose its license for telecom because of willful criminal behavior thats readily documented?

More than 30% of Americans cant afford even a one time incidental of $10. They are doing this type of stuff habitually as though they were an active threat against the American people.

Comcast broadly doesnt have a positive brand and thats thoroughly earned.

5g is coming online, bringing cable speeds to wireless drastically increasing the likely competition and ease of market entry in some respects.

So how can you profit from a companies systematic criminal negligence and years of bad business practices?

You can fairly easily take scaled bearish options positions if you time your entries. Instead of paying the $5 and $10 criminally fraudulent charges you can invest that money.

This company could be worth more as a reverse merger but regardless the current price likely isnt reflective of its actual value.

It would also likely be worthwhile to ""raise awareness"" regarding current shareholders of the criminally negligent manner of its handling of their investment capital because I wouldnt want to be the last one out the door. Btw if I'm a company egregiously fraudulently billing customers for $5 and $10 charges every month when it costs hours of multiple support desks time who are paid more than that, how do you think I do my books? Quality of earnings, undoubtedly. Surprisingly criminally defrauding customers creating shareholder liability and class action liability at a minimum might be a bad idea.

Any thoughts and opinions about this I would appreciate."

8,2018-04-21,InterestingNews1,3,5 great long ideas that you should know about,"**Growth Stocks**

Cognex Corp Cognex Corp (CGNX) stock price has dropped 30% over the past six months largely due to a once off tax charge that meant earnings increased by “just” 19% in 2017. However analysts looking beyond that non-recurring charge would see Q4 revenue increased 39% and adjusted net income rose 46%. That follows years of strong 30% earnings growth.

The company, which makes machine vision systems to capture digital images that can be processed by computers, has a bright future. The business is driven by automation, production lines and robotics and there is huge potential. Management project sales from areas such as 3D products and logistics will grow 50% annually. After the recent drop the stock trades on a TTM PE of 35. Given the fantastic prospects that looks cheap.

Spartan Motors Speciality Vehicle manufacturer Spartan Motors (SPAR - beware small cap stock) has had a good year in 2017 with revenues up 20% and earnings up c.86% (fourth quarter earnings more than doubled). The CEO said that the performance will ""provide a sound foundation for future long-term growth, increased shareholder value and an acceleration of earnings growth in 2018"".

The company has a rosy outlook with significant opportunities from entering the fragmented commercial and retail market, from an expanding e-commerce delivery business that supports the growing number of retailers entering the home delivery segment and from its optimal position to serve the growing alternative fuel market for the large fleet operators.

That's a lot of positives driving recent growth and enabling the company to guide for revenue growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 39% in 2018.

Given all the good news its no surprise the stock price has doubled over the past year. But with a price/sales of 0.83 and a 2019 forward PE of 15 the stock still looks good value.

Please be aware that with a market cap of $600 million Spartan Motors is a small cap stock with elevated risks and little liquidity.

**Value Stocks**
Rocky Mountain (RME) agricultural dealerships trades on a pretty cheap valuation (TTM PE 10.5) and pays a decent dividend (3.7%). For a cyclical dealership that would suggest that its nearing the end of the upcycle, but the outlook for Rocky Mountain looks positive for a number of reasons.

Steep manufacturer price increases in 2016 and 2017 have held back demand and a jump in sales is expected. Farmers incomes are faring reasonably well and farmers can only hold off upgrading tractors in the short term -- eventually pent up demand returns with force.

If that demand is coupled with multiple expansion to a reasonable PE of 12 or even 14 investors would see significant upside of 40% or more.

**Insider Buying**
At Ryman Hospitality Properties (RHP), the hotel REIT, CEO Colin V. Reed purchased $487,291 of stock on Tuesday. It was his second purchase year having purchased $450,000 in January. It comes after a very strong performance in 2017 with net income increasing 10.5 percent to $176.1 million for the year.

Mr Reed said at that time “With limited new supply coming online for the foreseeable future, and our own high-return capital projects scheduled to open throughout 2018, we believe we are in a prime position to benefit from this unique opportunity in both the near and long-term.” In guidance Mr Reed said he believed 2018 was shaping up to be a strong year and that the forward book of business was as strong as it has ever been and guided for adjusted EBITDA to increase 8.3%.

That positive outlook is supported by Citi analyst Michael Bilerman who upgraded RHP earlier this month due to its promising growth outlook. With a yield of 4.3% and decent growth prospects other investors may want to join Mr Reed.

**Microcap**
RF Industries Limited (RFIL) is a high risk microcap with a market capitalisation of just $50 million. That said it has seen a remarkable level of growth in recent quarters with revenues increasing 56% year on year in the first quarter and a loss of $339,000 became a profit of $454,000. The company provides products and systems for radio frequency (RF) communications and wireless with notable applications for mobile networks.

Growth was reported across all divisions and management said they were beginning to see very early preparations for the roll out of 5G for which RFIL produce the cable, the connectors, the jumpers, all the equipment to allow the radio systems to function. That’s going to provide huge growth over the next two years and RFIL is already seeing the benefits.

The company reported an increase in backlog to $20.2 million as of January 31, 2018 compared to $4 million at October 31, 2017. Thats huge growth for a company with annual sales of $30 million. It’s more notable given RFIL has historically not had a large backlog and indeed it’s rarely ever been disclosed.

The stock price has increased 266% over the past year but with revenue growth of 50%, the company’s return to profitability and a valuation of 1.25 times annualised sales -- that looks cheap.

**For the record, I don’t own any of these stock. I am not being paid to write this. I am not a bot. I just found the ideas interesting.**

16,2018-09-27,eslerjm,1,Facebook as a Sales Platform: The case against everyone else," 

Written September, 2018 by James M. Esler

Before you read this, please visit [This Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf2W9PferpA)

The following relates to Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries. This article is not designed to recommend a buy/hold/sell position on the company.

**By the numbers**

The company currently trades at about 11 and 22 times its Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) sales and revenue over the last 12 months (respectively). From 2013 to 2017, Facebook revenue and earnings grew about 51% and 81% on average, per year (respectively). From the perspective of discounted cash flows, if the market price was static (or worse dropped) over the next three years and the company achieved a 50% CAGR, the 22x earnings multiple will be reduced to 6.5x. If the company achieved a 30% CAGR for the following 3 years after, the multiple reduces to 3x. However, that’s simply 6 years of cash flows discounted, and for a company that will be around indefinitely, the current price-to-earnings multiple is determined more than 90% by the earnings *after* the first 5 years. This is factored in to the price target (not included in this article). Additionally, the revenue per global user is about $5.97 per user currently (not including Instagram, Whatsapp, or Oculus VR). The current revenue heavily leans on Facebook’s controversial Pixel feature, though as you will see below, the revenue structure is likely to change significantly in the near term.

**Capital Structure and Expenses:**

The company’s capital structure has been very consistent since its IPO in 2012. Facebook hasn’t used bank money – only $2 billion of long term debt in the past 3 years (paid off almost immediately). Assets have increased about 48% on average every year for the past 5 years. The capital structure relies on the retention of internally generated profits. The only other deviation from the capital structure was a stock issuance for the Whatsapp acquisition (2014) – since then, the company has consistently bought back every year, including over $5 billion in Q2 2018.

With a TTM profit margin of nearly 40%, the company should not pay a dividend to shareholders. Facebook returns 25% per year to equity holders, and has increased free cash flow 51% on average each year over the past three years. The business model does not have any inventories (ex-Oculus), so cash generation is simpler and purer than many other businesses (including Amazon) – this is the reason accounts payable is an insignificant figure (&lt;$400 M). SG&amp;A at 18% of revenues in 2017, from about 23% in 2015. R&amp;D at 19% of revenue, from 27% in 2015. These are the main drivers of current bottom line growth and will likely continue to be. Margins will like continue to improve as Facebook continues to automate processes. The decrease in labor costs maybe from programs being able to replace employees.

**Regulation:**

Many investors believe regulation will compress Facebook’s margins, saying that litigation on grounds of data practices and even antitrust will erode earnings growth. Such positions are hard to justify, since Facebook competes in many circles, most notably against Google, Twitter, and Amazon.com. Further, the company does not charge users any fees, so it does not have the ability to ‘fix prices’. Litigation would be protracted if it did occur, though simple fines are much more likely. The Justice Department likely will not step in here for high profile trials. As you will see below, Facebook Inc is taking large steps to enhancing Pixel and encrypting data points to secure user data.

**Facebook and the future of shopping**

***In the near future, Facebook will be a leader in e-commerce globally.*** This will manifest through use of both Business to consumer (B2C) marketing and Rich Communication Services (RCS). Facebook consistently is making the buying experience easier, more secure, and less expensive (both monetarily and psychologically). We are in the early days of Facebook being a dominant business.

At this time, Facebook has a total of 1.47 Billion daily active users (DAU) using only Facebook (not Instagram, Whatsapp, or Oculus). Whatsapp has about 1.5 Billion daily active users, and Instagram has about 0.6 Billion DAU. On all of their platforms, Facebook Inc has about 2.5 Billion Monthly Active Users (MAU), and there is very little penetration in China at this time. Considering these numbers, about 40% of the world (ex-China) is on Facebook. For another reference point, Amazon has about 30 Million MAU (0.5% of global population). Facebook has created a social experience that does not cost anything and users receive tremendous value every single day from Facebook.com, Instagram, and Whatsapp. The users are generally able to make significant purchases, do most shopping online, and will shop at the market with the best prices/products. Thus, if Facebook can prove to its users that it can provide a better shopping experience than other online stores (Wal-Mart, Amazon, Etsy), it will be able to better connect businesses and consumers on the platforms. The better shopping experience will likely come from knowing the customer in depth, using prescriptive analytics to enhance the sales process for millions of goods and reducing the potential stresses of purchase decisions. Once achieved, Facebook will monetize by charging businesses a small markup on each customer interaction, though users will likely never pay a fee for the service explicitly.

**Main Ecosystem**

To the untrained eye, it would appear that Facebook acquired Instagram, Whatsapp, and Oculus for more users and possibly synergies. A commonly held belief is that Facebook made these acquisitions to harvest user data to sell to advertisers. Seems that very few people are unsure what Facebook has planned for these acquisitions currently, let alone in the future.

**Whatsapp** – how does it fit in? Whatsapp is the largest rival to traditional SMS texting that comes standard on mobile phones (ie Android SMS, Apple chat). Whatsapp currently supports Rich Communication Service (RCS, see generations summary below), which allows large files to be sent seamlessly without compromise. Whatsapp also uses end-to-end encryption over wi-fi so no one can see the message outside the sender and recipient (not the service provider or Facebook either). The end-to-end encryption will soon prove to be the largest competitive advantage for Facebook as an e-commerce company and also will give users confidence that Facebook Inc is a good steward of their data. Businesses selling to Facebook users need to ensure that the sales process is protected from malicious actors (ie hackers) because sensitive information will be sent over Whatsapp, including forms of payment from the user, and products from vendors (such as airline tickets). At this time, there are 1.5 Billion DAU on Whatsapp, and many of them business owners, making a strong case for B2C marketing. Whatsapp for business simply changes your Whatsapp account to a business account and now you can begin marketing with all of your original Whatsapp contacts. Your contacts can then share all of your business information with others very easily and in one place. From there, Whatsapp provides you free chatbots to communicate with clients. Facebook Inc’s Messenger App has very similar features to Whatsapp, though Messenger has only about 1 Billion MAU since spinning off just before the IPO.

**Facebook** – how does it fit in? Facebook is a leader in data aggregation, analytics, and prediction mostly on consumers, but increasingly on businesses. The longstanding idea has been to be able to ***prescribe*** what users want before they even know, based on data from its massive user population. This is prescriptive analytics, and it is the holy grail of advertising – with the potential to revolutionize the shopping experience. To be brief, prescriptive analytics in the 3rd (and final) level of data analytics, allowing for conditional probabilities to determine each step in a given process. Thus, machines will put users in touch with businesses based on the users’ preferences, and in theory, the buying process should be very easy based on millions of iterations of the same transaction.

The two drivers of purchasing on Facebook: Facebook Market place and ads in the news feed. The market place (which launched October 2016) will allows consumers to search for products specifically and the feed allows vendors to push to consumers. In both cases, the consumer will click the advertisement and begin a Whatsapp chat (see link at the beginning of this article).

**Instagram** – how does it fit in? Very similar to Facebook above, while also using RCS very efficiently. Vendors show up with images and video advertisements in the feed and also in the ‘stories’ section. Users click on the vendor and can now communicate directly to the vendor. With Instagram TV (IGTV, launched July 2018), Instagram is attempting to add a YouTube mimic. YouTube currently has over 1.8 Billion MAU and has a large head start on IGTV, though YouTube is generally a destination for users, rather than a social square. Facebook Live is a very similar product: both of these ventures will be expensive in the short term as the company pays influencers to attract users away from YouTube. Interestingly, Instagram still has room to grow, since it is increasing market share every year from its rival Snapchat, which still has 188 Million DAU.

**Oculus** – how does it fit in? Hang out with your friends virtually. This brings a new dimension to ordinary conversation. The long term goal of the acquisition is *most likely* to have the experience of trying products before you buy them. Also, VR gives a stronger attraction to users getting on Facebook’s platform, since users will find it even more convenient to know what peers and influencers are doing. The VR market has not taken off– Oculus likely has years of sunk R&amp;D and talent acquisitions costs ahead of it until costs scale down. 6g has been rumored to support peer-to-peer AR/VR.

**Summary of network communication types (ie generations):**

SMS (1g, 2g)– short messaging services, analog and digital. This service represented the entire mobile phone market from around 1980 until the early 21stcentury, and still is dominant in developing countries. The 3rd generation of mobile networks allows for much enhanced Multi-Media files to be transmitted user to user.

MMS (3g, 4g)– Multi-Media Services for the transmission of images and videos. This has been prevalent in developed economies for just over a decade, and was made possible by larger network infrastructure that led to expense scaling. While this service is an upgrade to SMS, there are still shortcomings, including file size limitations. Often, images and videos must be compressed, which is becoming more common with continuous mobile phone camera improvements. 4g allows for improved wi-fi connectivity.

RCS (wi-fi, 5g)– Rich Communication Services for easier transmission of very large files. This generation was first created in 11/2016 and is very limited currently. Many network providers do not support RCS for problems with expense scaling (AT&amp;T and Vodafone do). At the end of 2018, beginning 2019, this service will become much more ubiquitous in developed nations, allowing for quicker, larger messaging capabilities. Thus, vendors will find it much easier to send “push” advertisements, products, receipts and consumers to “pull” large files from sites, vendors, and peers seamlessly. 5g may advance to make peer-to-peer AR/VR less expensive and attainable.

**Current sales cycle (in general terms):**

Suppose you are interested in buying a bed. You research online about beds.

The micro-decisions to make:

·  Where do you do the research and is it valid?

·  Price

·  Payment method

o  Cash

o  Credit

·  Sizes,

·  Interior design styles to match the rest of your home

·  What your friends have bought

·  What store to buy from

o  Online

o  Physical Location

§  Drive time

§  Sales pressure

·  Method, timing and cost of delivery

·  Complementary pieces (for each of these, repeat all above micro decisions)

o  Mattress

o  Sheet sets

o  Blankets

o  Bedside tables

o  Dressers

The current sales process (above) includes over 60 micro decisions for simply buying a bed. This raises a few very important points:

1.  Many consumers will avoid buying a bed and keep what they have, even if they are uncomfortable

2.  Mistakes can happen at any of the decisions.

3.  Psychological stress can arise from buyer’s remorse if mistakes are made. Also stressful if there was a missed opportunity (FOMO)

4.  Psychological stress can arise from avoiding the purchase and living uncomfortable

Machines can make the buying process easier by way of prescriptive analytics. Consumers will soon understand this is true because the true costs are the time these decisions take and also (most importantly) the *stress* of making all of these little decisions. The stress may come from inability to make decisions (paralysis by analysis) and/or living with poor buying decisions (buyer’s remorse and FOMO).

If you research beds online, Facebook (through its “Pixel” feature) will have popups for stores you can buy from almost immediately after you research . This technique is called ‘retargeting’ and is one of the largest competitive advantages of the Facebook platform. At this time, retargeting is very awkward and unwanted. Retail stores (and Amazon) get the majority of all traffic because it feels natural to pick something on your own.

The general idea of machine learning is to help us make all decisions easier. We are still at the beginning of machine learning – only a small fraction of buying decisions (both residential and commercial) around the world are handled by machines currently. *However*, as new generations find that all decisions can be made by machines, and that by this, the consumer has a more convenient, more efficient, and overall less expensive shopping experience, sales traffic will only be online. We are likely a long way off from this, though e-commerce growth numbers clearly show we are moving in such a direction.

**Future of sales:**

If you are considering buying a bed, you search the Facebook marketplace for vendors. When you find one you like, you can begin discussing the options through Whatsapp directly (as detailed in above segment). With its Pixel feature, Facebook Inc. will maintain advantages over competitors by providing the vendor with troves of information about you as the customer. There are hundreds of quantitative data points and several qualitative data points at the disposal of vendors and users right now, though the growth of these data points will rise logarithmically until a plateau stage (several years away). Vendors are strongly encouraged to make their offering as detailed as possible so that Facebook can create better, more personalized user audiences, and visa versa.

In the near term, the consumer will become more confident that his/her data is being properly secured (ie end-to-end encryption) and will enter the sales process increasingly from social media platforms/RCS providers where they visit each and every day. Prescriptive analytics will guide the consumer toward a fitting product; however, this sales process may not be prescriptive enough until the longer term. The coordination of quantitative and qualitative data points across millions of products will eventually lead to better fitting product recommendations.

**E-Commerce example: Amazon vs. Facebook**

Whichever company knows more about you will have an easier time getting your business. This includes your friendships, your family members, your socioeconomic status, your state of health, your demographics, your personality etc. Users go on Facebook to understand their world and friends better, which is a very strong value add that is showing increasing strength year over year.

Users go to Amazon for the sole purpose of shopping, which will likely be harder to maintain because users do not get anything out of the platform outside of purchases. This traffic-generation model may not be as sustainable as that of Facebook Inc. Amazon does, in fact, have many bolt-ons like Whole Foods, Twitch, Music, Alexa, etc. so that users are stickier. Currently, very few of Amazon’s potential sales centers make a durable profit margin over 3% (ie Whole Foods is still losing money). Based on many commentaries, users are indifferent to *where* they buy something, as long as they have the most convenient, least expensive shopping experience.

Facebook’s product has durability since the user’s peers and influencers (Instagram) are constantly posting things of interest to that user. Case in point: Amazon has 30 Million Monthly users, while Facebooks platforms have estimated over 2.5 Billion. To put that in perspective– monthly, for every 1 visitor to Amazon, there are over 85 visitors to Facebook platforms. Facebook currently has a 41% net profit margin (Amazon \~ 5%) with about $22 Billion in earnings (Amazon \~ $5.5). A big advantage for Facebook from a financial perspective is that it controls no inventories, preferring to act as a toll road for B2C transactions. Amazon, however, has distribution facilities, warehouses, and many low-level employees that have the potential to reduce long term profitability.

Amazon does not have a messaging application or social media platform yet. Facebook can meet the consumer where they are rather than having the consumer come into the Amazon store. Importantly, many vendors are not comfortable yet listing on Amazon, since Amazon owns the client, essentially, and can (not to say it would) cut the vendor out of the sale. Facebook allows vendors to simply have access to consumers and data to improve the sales cycle.

In summary, the purveyor that knows more about the consumer and can execute at the lowest applicable prices will win.

18,2018-09-21,EasyMoneyGuy,23,5G Rollout,"Hey I'm new here. Does anyone have any ideas on investing in the 5G technology? I'm asking because a U-verse tech guy was out yesterday fixing my internet connection, it's like the 4th time this year, and he told me that AT&amp;T knows about the problems with there internet service in my area but they're not going to put $ in fixing it because they're concentrating on the new technology, 5G rollout. AT&amp;T wants to start getting customers on the new network. I guess one of the problems with 5G is that there isn't a universal standard for the technology, I guess there's basically two. Anyway, does anyone have a homerun stock(s), say like an Amazon, Facebook, Apple, you know what I mean?   "
19,2018-09-14,grendel54,2,5G race,"I just learned that 5G is rolling out and because the Asian market is leading the race the US is putting the gas down and rolling out 5G as fast as it can.  I know that Verizon is leading the race rolling out 5G in October and AT&amp;T is right behind in December.  What I am looking for is infrastructure plays.  Who are the major players in the roll out of 5G in hardware installation everywhere.  I am already invested in VZ but am looking for a growth stock that will benefit from this 5G roll out.

Any thoughts?

20,2018-09-12,seekingtheta_shoes,4,[Serious DD] on TSMC,"Ok guys, so my weekly 2-day WSB ban has expired and I am back. I want to share with you some very autistically intelligent DD about this large company called TSMC. TSMC has become the most dominant semiconductor player that not many people have talked about until recently. They create the most advanced, production-ready node (mobile 7nm and HPC 12nm) and will soon create the 7nm HPC with AMD CPU/GPU and Nvidia GPUs.

The 3 largest foundries are TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and Global Foundry. Out of these, only TSMC is 7nm capable with 5nm w/EUV scheduled for next year. Samsung said they will have 7nm EUV by 2nd half of next year, and Intel's 10nm (equivalent to TSMC's 7nm) is nowhere to be found...

Here is the recent timeline of events:

1) AMD switches over from GlobalFoundry after GF shuts down 7nm.

2) GF is out of 7nm.

3) Samsung and Intel having problems with EUV migration. Intel has a boat load of other concerns (including getting large datacenter chips to get good yield as compared to AMD's multi-die approach - very smart Lisa! ).

4) Rumor has it (https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/11/intel-allegedly-outsourcing-some-14nm-orders-to-tsmc-as-mac-chip-maker-struggles-with-die-shrink) that Intel will outsource some 14nm to TSMC after 50% shortage of supply. That is completely unacceptable. In my opinion, I think big players such as Apple who needs these chips for their macbooks demanded this be done with a reputably consistent supplier.

5) a couple days ago, TSMC reported August earnings that were better than expected, as TSMC was hit with a computer virus (https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20180910PD212.html).

6) TSMC may acquire a memory company (either Nanya or Micron, https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/mannerisms/dilemmas/tsmc-looking-buying-memory-company-2018-09/). The motivation is to develop better integrated solutions that contain both memory and logic/compute. I would really like TSMC to buy MU but it is most likely not going to happen due to US regulations. On the other hand, Nanya has somewhat outdated memory (~DDR3). Maybe some business agreement with MU instead of full on acquisition?

7) Apple will continue investing and using time-tested TSMC 7nm/5nm chips over Apple-rival Samsung, which already supplies OLED and DRAM to Apple.

8) Qualcomm/Huawei exclusively using TSMC's 7nm (recent news).

9) Xilinx (in 5G) using TSMC exclusively.

10) ARM using TSMC exclusively (https://www.anandtech.com/show/11832/tsmc-teams-up-with-arm-and-cadence-to-build-7-nm-chip-in-q1-2018).

8) Future 7nm customers include: AMD, NVDA, Apple, Xilinx, ARM, GraphCore (potential), Qualcomm and other mobile players, custom solns from: Google (TPU), FB, etc.

8b) Future 14nm: Intel

EDIT:

Furthermore, the foundry industry is now looking like the memory industry when only a bunch of players could survive. As a result, margins will naturally grow with lack of competition.

TSMC will own 5G+AI. If you are playing semis, I would overweight TSMC in that basket. Disclosure: I am long TSM

2nd EDIT:

My gut feeling: *EUV (Samsung/Intel) will be very cost-prohibitive (very low yield) till early 2020. EUV (soft x-ray at 13.5nm light) is extremely different than 193nm+double patterning litho (which has been time-tested for a decade+). It is the single greatest change in process technology since the patterning of FinFets. As such, the yields will be extremely poor. TSMC's website slated for risk-production of 5nm w/EUV in 2019, which puts 2020 in production target. TSMC however said that they will likely introduce 7nm FF+ w/ EUV in 2019. * Therefore, I bet Samsung and Intel will have to fall back to non-EUV in 2019 for production, giving TSMC a 1-2 year head start... Of course EUV will be refined but it will take till 2020 to improve yields to production standards. TSMC was very smart in being conservative with their nodes while Intel is cannibalizing their own fabs.

22,2018-09-04,Daddyku,0,Nvidia and Qualcomm are 2 of the best tech stocks,"Nvidia is going to replace Netflix in the FAANG stocks. 

Netflix focuses on digital movies and tv shows and their original content has been great. I think their stock will continue to go up in the near future, but without other innovation I think the big hitter is going to be Nvidia.

Their Hardware (GPUs) and software (Cuda) come at a perfect time when machine learning, AI, Pc gaming and crypto mining are literally at the early crescent stages of popping off. 

Qualcomm is working on next gen chipsets compatible with AI and VR and is making waves with 5G LTE which will further enhance smart cities and The IoT experience. 

These stocks are highly undervalued trailblazers and there has never been a better time than now to be All In tech stocks. "

24,2018-10-11,uy6637,1,verizon restructuring the entire company for 5G,"This story completely baffles me. How can a company lay off literally 1/3 of its workforce and still expect to be innovative and relevant long term? If 5G fails to compete with cable, which that is a very huge possibility as cable already has the plant ready for things like docsis 3.1 and they can also offer 5G, where does that leave verizon and shareholders? They failed to compete with DSL and FIOS and now they're trying 5G which may or may not work depending on how cable responds which I think they're pretty well prepared for 5G competition. 

Also, really shocked it isn't being talked about more in the media.

27,2018-11-14,sockmuffin314,1,Why isn't 5G priced into AAPL's stock price or unit numbers?,"5G is going to be massive and it is either coming out in the 2019 iphones or (more likely) the 2020 iphones.  It makes sense that iphones sales should increase massively with 5G since everyone will want to upgrade.  It also makes sense that people won't upgrade as much this upcoming year because they're waiting for the 5G phone, hence less iphone sales in 2019. 5G is going to be MASSIVE for iphone, but right now everyone's just focused on the short term.  Are people speculating that 5G will fail or not be a big deal?  Why isn't 5G priced in when we all know it is coming and will be massive?"
