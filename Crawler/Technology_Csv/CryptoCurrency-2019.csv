2,2019-01-22,markyu007,1,One of the world's largest crypto exchanges looks to go public in the US through a reverse merger (CNBC),"Blockchain Industries announced it had signed a binding letter of intent to merge with Singapore-based Blockchain Exchange, the majority owner of Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb.

The plan involves the non-conventional route of buying an existing public company, then listing through a reverse merger — which could be much faster than an initial public offering, or IPO.

The deal would mark the first cryptocurrency exchange to be publicly traded in the U.S.

3,2019-01-22,DistinctSkin,1,Stablecoins: A brief guide to invest in 2019 (Hacked),"*Stablecoins are* ***cryptocurrencies*** *with a value pegged to a currency or to exchange traded commodities. Many projects today are researching and developing such technology. Issuers distribute stablecoins to customers in exchange for fiat currency such as USD at a 1:1 fixed exchange rate. USD is a desirable medium of exchange and globally accepted unit of account, making it a good choice for a stablecoin. Stablecoins most often take the following shapes.*

* *Fiat-collateralized: Reserves in a national currency collateralize the creation and issuance of such tokens. The goal is price stability by pegging a token’s value to a reserved fiat value.*
* *Crypto-collateralized: Cryptocurrencies backing cryptocurrencies. That might sound far fetched or futuristic, but it is possible in the present day. Forget the Gold Standard. Now you can hold a cryptocurrency backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies.*
* *Seigniorage: These tokens are not-collateralized. Software maintains the price stability.*
* *Hybrid: When you blend the three basic approaches above – or some assortment thereof – you get a hybrid stablecoin.*

*Let’s go deeper.*

6,2019-01-17,RoyCangjian,1,"Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: The Biggest Crypto Collabs and Partnerships"," 

 **Bitcoin** 

It’s rumored that institutional investors are accumulating Bitcoin through OTC markets despite bearish market sentiment. Whilst retail investors are panicking, institutional investors are said to be acquiring Bitcoin – an assumption that leaves many wondering as to why markets have not yet shown many signs of recovery when a.k.a smart money is flowing into the space.  

Professional traders and institutional investors are highly cautious about accumulating new assets and are experts at acquiring them without affecting the market. There are a variety of hedge funds that are solely focused on investing in Bitcoin and venture capital funds that have begun to provide the necessary financial support for upcoming startups that have dedicated themselves to building applications and services for the Bitcoin ecosystem.During bear markets, institutional investors prefer bitcoin over altcoins due to positive sentiment and because BTC is the most established cryptocurrency.

The SEC has denied multiple Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications as cryptocurrency enthusiasts eagerly await the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF. Many are betting on the institutionalization of Bitcoin once new yet traditional investment vehicles are made available to investors.

 

**Ripple**

Unlike most decentralized projects, Ripple is focused on connecting banks, payment service providers, digital asset exchanges and corporates through blockchain technology. Although XRP, the cryptocurrency used by Ripple’s xRapid, is accused of being centralized, it remains popular due to the fact that investors recognize the compelling value proposition of connecting existing financial institutions and remittance services using distributed ledger technology.Originally released in 2012, Ripple has managed to build up an extensive list of clientele that consists of public banks, central banks, tech companies and corporations. The value here is the Ripple network that provides a reliable solution to moving assets quickly around the world, which is being utilized by banks to shift money between different foreign countries.

**Ethereum**

By far the most utilized blockchain protocol for businesses to issue their own native digital currency token, Ethereum allows smart contract functionality that has managed to get the attention of large institutions and corporations. Whilst Ethereum is classified as a decentralized project, it has managed to attract companies like Microsoft, Samsung, LG, Intel, AMD, BP and financial institutions like JP Morgan, CME group, Scotiabank and Commerzbank.

Due to the sheer popularity of the project, Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA), consisting of over 300 members, was formed to help connect established organizations with blockchain developers interested in building applications on top of Ethereum.

**Aergo**

An upcoming fourth generation blockchain project that plans to help enterprises make use of distributed ledger technology, Aergo is based on the proprietary software known as Coinstack.

Aergo is a hybrid blockchain that is open to the public and designed to help large-scale enterprises deploy their own preferred blockchain. Renowned VC fund Sequoia Capital, known for focusing on the technology industry and backing Forbes 500 companies, is one of many VC firms investing in Aergo, along with FBG, GBIC, Arrington XRP, Dekrypt, Rockaway, Neo Global and Divergence Digital.The project will help enterprises adopt blockchain technology by making it easy to design and build decentralized applications on private or public chains or a mix of both. Aergo plans to provide Blocko, Korea’s number one blockchain infrastructure provider, with a more decentralized solution to service its existing clients including Shinhan Bank, Samsung, Lotte Card, KRX and the South Korean government.

**OmiseGo**

A decentralized payment solution provider as well as a bank, exchange and blockchain gateway for businesses, OmiseGo was created by parent company Omise, a venture-backed payment service company operating in Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand.Omise is a popular payment gateway solution in Asia, well-established in Thailand and backed by large corporations such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Allianz, Axxa and SCG. The company has been showing impressive growth since its inception in 2013. It’s expected that once OmiseGo is fully operational with its mainnet release, Omise merchants will switch over to the decentralized blockchain network

**Vechain**

A project aiming to disrupt the supply management industry by leveraging a blockchain-based platform that digitizes the supply chain and tackles goods counterfeiting, Vechain is essentially a Blockchain-as-a-Service company that plans to build a trust-free network for businesses to collaborate and track inventory in a decentralized ecosystem.By deploying a public distributed ledger, Vechain hopes to enhance supply chain management by combining the ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** with blockchain technology. Manufacturers can easily track and manage supplies, as all the information is made available on Vechain’s public blockchain. Consumers will also have the ability to determine the quality and authenticity of the products sold. The project has secured a few high-level partnerships with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the government of Gui’an, Shanghai Waigaoqiao’s Direct Imported Goods Sales Centre, DNV GL, BMW and China Unicom.  


**Icon**

A project dedicated to helping enterprises deploy their own distributed ledgers, ICON is an independent chain that connects multiple community sidechains, enabling cross-platform data and value communication.Positioned in South Korea, a country that is considered to be the most crypto friendly nation in Asia, ICON has established a variety of strategic partnerships with large corporations such as Line, Samsung Electronics, Smilegate and SK Planet. The project is diversifying its reach by collaborating with the Korean government on numerous initiatives in the healthcare, education, insurance and customs sectors.Vasilios FilipVasilios Filip got into Bitcoin back in 2015, believing that distributed ledger technology will disrupt traditional financial services and banks. With a background in law and economics, he has since kept his eye on blockchain applications whilst dedicating his time writing about anything crypto-related.

7,2019-01-17,Question-Asking_Prof,1,Are futures contracts ever longer than one year in duration? (and other questions),"In my armchair research, most examples of futures contracts are of one year in duration and I want to know whether contracts for multiple years are common? My area of interest is cryptocurrency, and while I'm not confident that prices will increase in the next 12 months, I become increasingly certain that prices will rise over a period of 24 months, 48, 72, etc.  But whether that's a sound intuition or not isn't the thrust of my question. I just want to know if such a speculation can be made or if 6 month/1 year futures contracts are the only opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus question to avoid making another thread: I'm also interested to know how you can measure daily volumes on futures contracts over mid to long term periods. For instance, I'd like to be able to view the average daily volumes of bitcoin futures contracts from July 2018 to January 2019 as a line graph as a means of gauging interest."

11,2019-01-15,cpclos,1,[Hidden Forces Special] ETC 51% Attack and What It Means for Proof-of-Work and Crypto Exchanges | Haseeb Qureshi,"Demetri Kofinas speaks with Haseeb Qureshi of MetaStable Capital about the recent 51% attack against Ethereum Classic, its implications for exchanges that continue to list smaller market-cap cryptos like ETC, Dash, Monero, etc., and what it means for the debate between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.

On January 5th, 2019, the digital currency exchange Coinbase detected a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. In order to protect customer funds, they immediately paused interactions with the ETC blockchain. Coinbase reported the 51% attack on January 7, 2019, but a few people on Twitter had already become aware that something wasn’t right with ETC. Pierre Rochard, an emerging thought-leader in the Bitcoin space, asked ETC developer Donal McIntyre on Twitter:  “Was there a deep reorg on Ethereum Classic yesterday?… 75 blocks deep I hear, with a double-spend.” Donal McIntyre replied: “Well ETC is still small and has many enemies so an attack with sufficient GPU power may be plausible, but I will check with others in the ecosystem.”

Demetri and Haseeb explore the reasons why the price of ETC was largely unaffected, what this latest attack means for the listing (or delisting) of similarly sized cryptocurrencies, and how this is sparking a larger debate about the efficacy of proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake as mechanisms for securing a cryptocurrency.

28,2019-02-11,fgz003,1,"OK, HERE WE GO","Hello everybody. 
I know that all of you are investors and looking for new ideas. 
I am also pretty sure, you all have invested or have heard about blockchain and cryptocurrency , like bitcoin ,Binance, Ethereum, DDPT, etc... and even invested in them as it showed from you users names.
The 1st idea i want to talk about is the decentralized travel using blockchain technology for travel. Maybe you also have heard of it, but I dont know if you do realize its future potential. 
To begin with, Decentralized travel is relatively new, but has a bright future, which makes it a good opportunity for investors. Also, It is growing fast, which is a good sign. 
 It is true that decentralized travel uses digital tokens, but what makes it different from other  currencies is that it provides travel services that we can make use of. Airlines ticket, hotels car rental agencies, etc at lower costs.
I am specifically talking about Xceltrip, the innovator at using blockchain technology for travel. It uses the XcelToken
 XcelToken, a first of its kind utility token, backed by the XcelTrip is listed in LATOKEN Exchange and will be available for trading on 25 March 2019.
LATOKEN is a rapidly growing Top-30 crypto exchange focusing on providing liquidity for new tokens: 
●    $140+ million daily turnover

●    120,000+ registered traders

●   250+ crypto pairs available for trading

XcelTrip also  accepts now  Ethereum and DDPT,  for every hotel bookings. They have over 500,000 hotels around the globe, where you can spend with Binance, Bitcoin, XcelToken and now with Ethereum and DDPT too.
Plus, they are soon releasing Flight Booking collaborating with 150 plus airlines. You can use all these tokens to book hotels and flights.

This is just to give you an idea about the future potential hiding within this company.
 You can have a peek at their website and even register for free. Nothing to loose, right!
It is easy to check it out , and if somebody wants me to give him a link to visit, i would be more happy to do so.
 Hope this 1st idea was helpful to some of you, otherwise i would be very embarrassed if all of you you think it was a waste of time reading this article

Brave is a browser that blocks ads and trackers. Learn more about it [Here](https://vimeo.com/209336437)

**Benefits of using Brave:**

Basically brave is a chromium-based browser. Meaning it looks almost identical to chrome because it is based on an open source project called chromium.

Now with brave, users get around 60 (5 dollars) BAT a month. (BAT is a cryptocurrency learn more [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/basic-attention-token/))

This currency is paid to the websites you visit. (with social media like youtube and twitch it's paid to the content creators)

You can easily import Cookies, Passwords, Bookmarks and other browser info from the most commonly used browsers

Brave is also planning to add a mobile sync with their mobile app so all the websites you visit, saved cookies, passwords and bookmarks will sync between all your devices.

Now this feature is BIG Chromium has TOR built in (Learn more about TOR [here](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en)). In my opinion it's better than the tor browser itself just because the interface is the same as usual.

The brave browser is focused on user privacy and its VERY easy to switch over.

Electra provides the solution for a fast, secure and easy to use currency that cannot be devalued, massproduced or gamed to give anyone an advantage. To achieve this, Electra uses the most secureblockchain technology ever created to ensure impenetrable security and instantaneous access to yourmoney. Electra's core technology is known as the NISTS blockchain which comprises the best advancesfrom the top five blockchain finalists that competed in a five-year long blockchain competition at theUnited States' National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST) between 2007 and 2012. Besidesbulletproof security, other key components of NISTS include a lightning fast algorithm for instantaneousaccess to your money with ultra-low energy consumption making Electra a superior and environmentally sustainable currency.

​

Electra's Supply

Electra has solved currency valuation concerns while ensuring future supply by incorporating a Proof-ofStakesystem that rewards active currency holders (nodes) for participating in a decentralized networkwith other nodes. Together these connected nodes verify and approve blockchain activity and keepidentical copies of all transactions, known as a ledger. Since the ledger is replicated and shared amongall nodes, manipulation is impossible. In return for verifying and approving blockchain transactions, anode is rewarded 2.5% of their respective currency holdings on an annualized basis. Beginning inOctober of 2019, the reward will be halved each year for the next seven years until it stabilizes at 0.02%annually in October of 2025. lt's important to note that the world's population is growing atapproximately 1.1% annually so Electra has ensured, that in time, there will be an appreciation of itscurrency by creating new supplies as a slower rate than world population growth. Oversupply oftraditional fiat currencies like Eurosand UDS's has eroded their buying power by 95% in the last 100 years.

​

Electra's Availablllty

At the time this was written, in December of 2018, there were approximately 29.2 billion Electra incirculation allowing for nearly anyone and everyone interested in investing in Electra's future to acquirethis cutting-edge digital currency of the future. This abundant avairability has helped distribute Electraworldwide and attract many people into the Electra community. At the time of this writing there areapproximately 17,000 Twitter followers, 12,000 Discord followers, and 9,000 Telegram followers and the community is growing rapidly.

​

Electra's Communlty Provides the Power

Electra's community of over 30,000 investors, followers and believers is growing daily and provides thepower behind this amazing currency. Electra was born in summer of 2017 by a developer with a visionof creating a ""safe, long-term, sustainable, self-governing cryptocurrency'' as stated in an interview inOctober 2018. Within the community, Electra's founder is known as EOl and has chosen to remainanonymous to keep the focus on the project and community rather than himself. In a recent interviewwith EOl, he stated that his identity would be revealed in due time. Today, Electra is supported entirelyby its community of volunteers which helps ensure its long-term viability from truly committedindividuals and also conserves valuable resources.

As Electra's community grows so does its potential for mass adoption with merchants, online stores,Point-of-Sale retailers and as a private payment option between individuals.

​

Transacting with ElectraPay

Electra can be used for any financial transactions with an easy to use mobile, web or desktop wallet.Like a traditional wallet, Electra's wallets are applications available for iOS and Android devices thatprovide secure and instantaneous access to your money.

Any merchant with a Magento, WooCommerce or Shopify based website can easily download a simpleplugin to allow them to begin accepting Electra payments. One of the best features of the Electrapayment system, known as ElectraPay, is that each merchant can select the currency they'd like toreceive in exchange for Electra. A merchant's preferred currency will be deposited into their bankautomatically without any effort or cost to them.

As an example, if someone pays a merchant with Electra from their mobile wallet, that merchant canselect to receive Electra, Euros, USD's or any other fiat or digital currency of their choosing. Thisexchange from one currency to another is seamless and costs the merchant nothing. What makes theexchange possible from one currency to another is what's known as an Atomic Swap. When someonesubmits their Electra payment to a merchant, an exchange rate between the two currencies isimmediately established from a public currency exchange and a contract is established between thebuyer and merchant that either can cancel without the need of a trusted third-party. Because of thecontract between the buyer and merchant, transactions are instantaneous and secure.

​

Electra's SocialPay

To allow for easy payments and donations within social networks like FaceBook, Weibe, lnstagram andother social media platforms, Electra's SocialPay is an application that easily allows users to transact anddonate to their favorite charities with Electra. Similar to online merchant payments, social mediapayments and donation recipients can select to receive Electra, Euros, USD's or any other fiat or digital currency of their choosing.

​

Electra's Foundation &amp; Future

On October 12, 2018, Electra's core team members established a legal entity in the Netherland calledthe Electra Project. The Electra Project foundation received 300MM Electra from founder, EOl for thepurposes of developing and promoting this cutting-edge digital currency. Long-term the foundation willbecome the recipient of donations and grants to further develop the world's Fastest, Most Secure and Easy to Use Currency."

## What is a crypto debit card?

A crypto debit card is a debit card that allows you to pay with at least one type of cryptocurrency. With crypto debit cards, you usually have the option to pay with Fiat currency as well.

  

While you'd rather pay with newer payment technologies (such as QR code scans that are automatically deducted from a mobile banking app or crypto wallet), many people may wish to use a card instead. Most, if not all, crypto cards offer the flexibility to pay with either plastic cards or mobile applications.

## Categories

In fact, there are several categories of crypto-debit cards on the market in 2019. Here are some of them:

**Physical crypto debit card:** Similar to a traditional debit card, which you can store in your wallet. The main difference is that you can use it to pay with Crypto.

**Virtual:** Serves approximately the same purpose as a mobile app for Cryptocurrency Wallet, unless it is normally supported by a payment company and can optionally be equipped with a physical card.

**Cards with credits:** Enables you to load the cryptocurrency on the map and automatically convert your crypto to Fiat and vice versa.

**Non-prepaid debit cards:** These are usually associated with your online crypto wallet and convert your crypto with every purchase in Fiat.

While originally used to underpin cryptocurrency transactions, the technology has quickly evolved to serve a wide range of business practices, solving a whole host of previously unattainable challenges.

Aware of this, many businesses are looking to build solutions either internally or by contracting developers. While it’s still possible for companies to build their proprietary blockchain architecture to support the application, that adds time and complexity to the development cycle.

Luckily, there’s a wide range of blockchain platforms available to allow developers to focus on adapting the platform to fit their needs rather than starting from scratch. When deciding which route to take, you’ll want to compare the features of the available platforms in relation to your needs.

The main problem in the modern Russian economy: the population becomes poorer faster than before. The analysis of statistical data shows that the population of the country becomes poorer much faster than in the period of the financial and economic crisis that arose as a result of the US mortgage crisis. It should be noted that by the end of 2018, the number of goods bought by Russians decreased greatly. The current stats significantly exceeds the figure that was characteristic of the Russian economy during the 1998 crisis.

The bad news is that the indicators, which determine future economic growth - primarily investments - have fallen much.  
According to the President of Sberbank, the use of blockchain technology will be an impulse to the development of the high-tech sector of the economy and its development prospects.  
The interest of Russian government in new economic models, capable to shake up the current economy of the country and attracting new investments, becomes quite understandable. The blockchain and cryptocurrency can act as a bridge.  
The general questions, which should be answered:

* Will the blockchain be able to change the current situation of Russian citizens?
* Is the Russian government able to assess Blockchain technology?
* Will the cryptocurrency status be equal to the ruble in 2019?
* Does the Russian government consider cryptocurrency as a solution for improvements or an opportunity to impose new taxes on the population?
* Will Russia start developing new blockchain or consider the possibility of using existing platforms like Waves, Credits or Bitfury?
* Will 2019 be the beginning of new reformations in the Russian economy and the beginning of blockchain use in real life sectors?

46,2019-03-05,Chickentaco123456,0,Binance Said To Be The Best Cryptocurrency Exchange For New Traders.,"There are tons of different cryptocurrency trading platforms available—both online and as an application. Throughout the last years, Binance has remained one of the most important, in terms of trade volume and new coins. For that reason, Binance is the best exchange for new traders, and our recommendation if you’re just getting into crypto trading.

The cryptocurrency exchange has been in the market since July the 14th 2017 and has been offering important services for cryptocurrency users. But is this platform specifically designed for new users or it has more professional features? In this article we will analyse whether this exchange is pretended for new users, more experienced investors or for both.

Is Binance for New or Experienced Traders?
Binance a virtual currency exchange that only works with virtual currency trading pairs. That means that if a new user that does not have any virtual currency wants to enter for the first time to the market, it will not be able to do it through Binance.

To start trading in the Binance platform it is necessary to send some funds in a cryptocurrency eligible for trading like Bitcoin or Ethereum. From there you can trade for several of the hundreds of coins that Binance lists. You can also use Binance’s own coin (BNB) for trading and for discounted fees.

Those experienced crypto traders will discover that this is a very simple mechanism. If they have currencies in any other exchange or wallet, with just some simple clicks they could start using Binance for trading.

For new investors, this may seem like extra steps, but it is commonplace amongst most major exchanges, and to get most coins that are not in the top few in market cap, you’ll need to trade with BTC or ETH. Binance offers the easiest trading experience given these similarities.

Two Different Platforms

Binance displays two different exchanges, one known as Basic and the other known as Advanced. The basic one, as the name suggests, is for users that just want to exchange some virtual currencies for others. In general, these are the users that trade some few pairs and that do it sporadically.

The advanced platform, on the other hand, has been built for more professional traders. That is, users that perform day trading activities, that trade different crypto pairs every single day, or that trade less pairs but very intensively.

The advanced platform has more complex features for traders that need detailed statistics and information. There are some trading pairs that offer graphics with better options and advanced information.

That means that the basic platform does have trading options but not so advanced and detailed as the other platform for experienced users. If you are just starting with virtual currencies the best what you can do is to use the Basic option, you will find it more intuitive and user friendly.

Conclusion

In sum, Binance is a great virtual currency exchange. At the moment it is the world's most used cryptocurrency trading platform. The exchange offers an important number of trading pairs and has added support to hundreds of tokens offered in different ICOs.

Binance strives hard to maintain it's position as the world's most popular cryptocurrency exchange. At this rate I don't think any other exchange will be able to take that spot from them.

51,2019-04-23,kbrower,0,"Inflation and how to diversify ""Money""","About a year ago I started giving myself a financial education. One thing I am trying to do is put my ideas to the test by publishing them online and taking feedback. I just finished my 2nd post:

&amp;#x200B;

Investing it all about the future. It's about ensuring you have the real resources to provide for a healthy and happy life. As life expectancies increase, wealth inequality increases, and asset prices increase, this becomes an increasingly difficult task for a majority of people. It's easy to lose the forest through the trees, so in this series of articles, I will put to paper how I think about the topic.

**Inflation and Money**

Let's say you are very fortunate and you have saved $10 million dollars and have a yearly expense of $100k per year. You are only concerned with being able to maintain your $100k lifestyle and not run out of money. Theoretically, that money would last 100 years if the real buying power stayed constant over time. It might be tempting to let that $10 million sit in a bank account and not worry about investing at all, but this chart shows how long the $10 million would last when you take into account inflation.

Source: self

Furthermore, historically there are instances of currencies undergoing much higher inflation if you look at what happened to Germany or [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_peng%C5%91). Your $10 million would have lasted less than 1 year if you started in [1922 Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic#Hyperinflation).

**Inflation Hedges**

Inflation is as good an excuse as any to introduce classes of assets that provide some protection against inflation. I will classify them as money, commodities, real estate, debt, and equities.

Money, whether it be a currency provided by a government, a precious metal, a cryptocurrency, or something else always has the same function. To be exchanged for real goods and services. It's impossible to say for certain what the money of the future will look like, but it is prudent to examine the history of money which may offer some clues to the future. INSERT HISTORY At the time of writing, inflation in the USA and in most countries is low and has been declining since the 1980s even as money supply and debt have expanded as a percentage of GDP. The consumer price index in the USA has increased by over 50% over the last 20 years while M2 money supply as more than tripled.

**Diversification of money**

If you are sure what we will be used as the money of the future and what will not be overly devalued by inflation, then it would be ok to stick to a single type of money. If you are like me that default choice would be dollars. But if you are not sure, it is prudent to diversify your money holdings to multiple currencies, precious metals, and even cryptocurrencies. It's important to set expectations and the goal of a money holding is not to get a return on investment. It is to mitigate inflation and maintain buying power. You may get lucky and see an increase in buying power over time but that is the exception, not the rule.

Per my previous article about wealth inequality, I find it especially prudent to hold some money in ways the wealthy do not. Inevitably a diversified portfolio of money will underperform whichever type of money maintains its buying power the best

In 2019, I use the money supply, the total value of gold/silver, and the total value of all cryptocurrencies as a starting point for determining a diversified portfolio of money. I then try to discount what would happen if inflation spiked up above 5% for dollars and other currencies. There would likely be a flight away from currencies and toward alternate forms of money. Given my time horizon of 50+ years, I think it's very likely for this scenario to unfold. In order to account for that likely scenario I underweight dollars relative to the market and overweight precious metals and cryptocurrencies.

**Global money**

15% dollars

77% bucket of other currencies

7.6% gold

0.1% silver

0.3% cryptocurrencies

**My Proposed Money Allocation**

40% dollars

40% bucket of other currencies

15% gold

2.5% bucket of other precious metals

2.5% bucket of cryptocurrencies

The easiest allocation is dollars. Given it is the most used world currency it is easy to keep dollars in FDIC insured bank accounts like Marcus on a money market account. Both of which provide convenient liquidity and an interest rate.

**How to invest in other all these potential forms of money?**

How to invest in precious metals? One option is to simply buy the coins and store them at your home or at a bank safe deposit box. This is a good option if you have a safe place to store the metal and do not plan on needing liquidity quickly or often. There are heavy transaction costs (up to 5%) when you do exchange the precious metal back to dollars. This only makes sense if you intend to hold for at least 10 years. There are also security concerns with storing precious metals at home or even transporting them through the mail and to and from a bank safe deposit box. The investments below try to balance low fees, security, and ease of backtesting. 

**My Proposed Money Allocation**

40% dollars (SHY)

40% bucket of other currencies (BWX)

15% gold (IAU)

2.5% bucket of other precious metals (SLV, PPLT, PALL)

2.5% bucket of cryptocurrencies (directly)

As you can see the over the last 5 years the performance of this allocation has been no better than just holding short term treasuries. Note that I manually adjusted cryptocurrency down for 2.5% to 0.5% to adjust for the 5x return over the last 5 years. If you look at this performance and find it disappointing, I think you are missing the point. This portfolio is designed to be a hedge against inflation without making a big bet on a single form of money. Just as you can diversify away from holding a single stock, I suggest diversify away from holding just dollars into other forms of money, whether it be other currencies, gold, cryptocurrencies, or other precious metals. This provides a form of defense against hyperinflation. Since this portfolio holds many forms of money, it is likely that one over more goes to 0 over time. That's why it's important not to rebalance this portfolio. Rebalancing with anything that goes to 0 can take the entire account to 0. When inflation rears its ugly head again, this portfolio is designed to mitigate some of that inflationary risk."
52,2019-04-23,TokenFlair,0,I Got Scammed by the Cryptocurrency Exchange EZBTC.CA," 

I wanted to make this post of my experience as a warning to others, especially Canadians as they have limited buying options when investing (speculating) into cryptocurrencies. I understand the subject of cryptocurrencies are polarizing to many, but nonetheless, it's an emerging asset class that deserves discussion because there are many ways to lose your funds. This isn't the fault of cryptocurrencies themselves, but the result of user error, outright scams, social engineering, hacks, or in my case not being up-to-date on current events.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many scams in cryptocurrencies, but shady exchanges are a classic dating back to the legendary Mt. Gox hack where 850,000 Bitcoins were stolen (worth approximately $4.6 billion at the time of this writing). Or the most recent Canadian QuadrigaCX exchange hack where the CEO allegedly died in India carrying the only private key to 200 million worth of customer funds.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that exchange hacks keep propping up in the news, so why then do they keep happening even in 2019? Because users are left with limited choices if they want to acquire cryptocurrency in the safest (ironic) and most convenient manner. In order to buy cryptocurrency, you first have to exchange it for fiat currency (USD, CAD, EUR). You could buy cryptocurrency from one of those Bitcoin ATMs you see at the mall but the fees are exorbitant and quite a few require ID as it is, so why not just sign up for an exchange instead? The next option is to buy them peer-to-peer in person for cash, but people feel unsafe dealing with strangers and large amounts of money. Further, liquidity would be an issue. This led to a boom of many cryptocurrency exchanges offering customers a place to buy and sell with the exchanges acting as the middle-man between users.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been away from cryptocurrency for a while and only came back recently. I've used the EZBTC exchange in the past without issues and decided I would use them again. What I didn't do upon my return was my homework on any updates/news regarding this exchange which resulted in my ordeal now. I noticed the website had an overhaul that now includes an express option for you to receive faster withdrawals if you deposited larger amounts (first red flag). I opted for the regular option I always used in the past and sent a small amount via eTransfer that was deposited in my account almost immediately (second red flag). In the past, my eTransfers regardless of amount took some time and up to many hours. Nonetheless, I made a purchase and initiated a withdrawal request that still hasn't been sent out to this day, and I am not the only one.

&amp;#x200B;

A condensed version of my story is that I got worried about my pending withdrawal with EZBTC and my emails/calls went unanswered. The live chat on their website was also disabled. I decided to tweet my situation to @ezBtcCanada and immediately got an email from the owner David Smillie himself urgently telling me to call him on a personal number. He deverified and suspended my account as a result of my tweets @tokenflair for ""security reasons"". After some talk (me saying I'll delete the tweets) he immediately reactivated and reverified my account again and said that my withdrawal will be taken care of the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the next day and my withdrawal is still pending. Calls/texts/email go unanswered again. Live chat is still disabled. I proceed to send another tweet instead. Like clockwork, I get a response from David shortly after and he was livid. He threatened to sue me for defamation if I continued posting about my situation on public forums. I told him I'll be waiting for his letter. He stated that my account would be receiving a lifetime ban and I will not be receiving my withdrawal but I would get an eTransfer refund in 30 days, and all this information would be included in an email I was supposed to receive on Monday April 22, 2019. I still have not received any such email, and my emails/call/texts to him are again being ignored. The saga continues.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important piece of advice I can give when it comes to cryptocurrency is that what's true today, is not true tomorrow. You must stay up-to-date on current events in cryptocurrency because your investment could be at stake. In my case, EZBTC was exhibiting red flags and had many user complaints that I would have seen had I just done some research prior to sending my money. I was not up-to-date regarding the status of this ""exchange"".

57,2019-04-14,CryptoPhantom13,0,"Cereneum, A New Interest-Bearing Token On Ethereum.","Cereneum is a brand new concept in cryptocurrency: a time-based interest-bearing Cryptographic Certificate of Interest (CCOI) on the Blockchain. Airdrops are given based on five of the most popular PoW cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Earn interest by staking your Cereneum for set periods of time.

The rate of interest you earn is based on how long you stake your Cereneum as well as the amount of the stake. Cereneum uses Pooled Interest, which means interest paid to stakers is higher when less tokens are staked. Stake periods can vary from one week to as long as five years, with the interest rising with the length of the stake. The more Cereneum that is staked the lower the supply available on the market, which can mean higher prices.

Unclaimed tokens are redistributed daily to stakers during the course of the year-long claiming period, greatly increasing their holdings.

Early unstakers are penalized, with those penalties distributed among current stakers. Additionally, there are bonuses available to those that utilize the referral program.

I would like to leave you guys here some investment opportunity that has changed my life!

I would like to present you FxTrading Corporation, it's a south Korean company that sells cryptotrading investment packages and pays a daily dividend of 1% to 2.5%. It also allows you to create your own team by using referral link and you also earn points from the people. Cryptocurrency is booming and more and more people are getting into it. I think the timing is perfect guys!

&amp;#x200B;

You receive the dividend payments in bitcoin which is skyrocketing right now, I'm earning over 200 dollars daily from this, and I'm trying to share to as many people as I can. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can then ask for a Wirex crypto visa card and just spend your bitcoin that way in your day to day life, that's what I do.

Can you imagine the opportunity the company is creating here! They are deploying a very robust customer loyalty system and include the innovating feature of cryptocurrency into this ecosystem. Once this picks on, more and more companies will want to buy a license to the customer loyalty system because there is such demand for the Phuncoin feature. This will generate extra revenue for the customer loyalty license, but it will also skyrocket the cryptocurrency that is attached to it. This is an actual software company with millions of revenue that is going to launch a new cryptocurrency that actual has a good chance to achieve mass adoption that actual has a fantastic use case.   
Look at the cryptocurrency market. There are currently a ton of cryptocoins out there, that are backed by absolutely nothing, don't have a long term vision for their coin BUT still these coins have a marketcap of a couple HUNDRED MILLION dollar. I repeat, some of these coins don't have an actual software company with 100 million of investment money backing them nor do they have any vision for their coin BUT still these coins have a market cap of 100 of millions or even BILLIONS.   
And they are going to include this in their already existing customer loyalty platform as a new feature. There will be an immediate demand and Phunware customer will be demanding the new feature. If they are smart, they should include that new feature into their customer loyalty platform which create an enormous ecosystem... Do you think people will invest in a coin that is being adopted superfast and that is backed by big software company that's adding new features continuously, OR are they investing in X coin?   
It's great to see the progress they are making with this new ecosystem. They are even stating that this platform will launch in June.

68,2019-05-26,markwealth41,0,Have a financial freedom today by investing in BITCOIN.,"A good financial expert will always tell prospects that the best way to create wealth and have a ceaseless cash flow of wealth is through investments.
The quest for wealth by humans has increased the high rate of financial schemes and investments platforms for creating or doubling investments- as most had turned out to be over the years.
This dire need for wealth is one of the major factors for the increase in financial fraud in the financial system.
Today, it is quite a tough task,-almost like solving a totally new algorithm- to tell which investments are genuine and which is not. 
Are people still risk takers in investments? Yes. Do they take a calculated risk outside of the Banking system? Yes. But the truth is, be it a calculated risk or not, an investor can never be too careful, and being too careful might be a big disadvantage to an investor or to one who is new in the investments world. It is as simple as this; look before you take the big jump!
In the investment world today, If you look well enough and pay close attention you will find an offer more lucrative and safer than the existing offers, and that offer is the CRYPTOCURRENCY.
 an investor can never be too careful and being too careful might be a big disadvantage to an investor..’ Remember that? Now let us tell you a simple story; Satoshi Nakamoto in the process of finding a lasting solution to financial centralization created the most outstanding innovation- BITCOIN.
Cryptocurrency at that period was less than $0.01 but it did not end there. Financial experts/analyst presumed this invention as a fraud or a ‘bubble’ and dissuade investors from investing in it.
December  2017, BITCOIN hits $19,783.06! This implies that investors who were ‘not too  careful’  invested in bitcoin- which was the first cryptocurrency,  are now millionaires 
Bitcoin  price  slumped  last year after all the attack on bitcoin by world financial experts. But the world have seen that bitcoin is unstoppable. And the price of bitcoin has started to rise again. As at the time of writing this the price of bitcoin stand at $8100.
Crypto analyst has presumed rise in bitcoin to be above $15000 dollar before the end of 2019. This implies that more people can be made millionaires and billionaires in cryptocurrency investments.

Sure it's still a young market but I don't think people realize just how big a market it really is. A quick google search will show you the top 12 crypto exchanges worldwide are trading over 1 billion USD in volume on a 24-hour basis. I don't think anyone could have predicted this when bitcoin came to fruition just over 10 years ago. 

Due to the massive success of these exchanges, companies wanting to create their own token have shifted their approach to what is now called an IEO (initial exchange offering) and it's paying off BIG! I'm talking about a company that released an IEO on one of the top 25 exchanges called Coineal and reached their cap just shy of 2 million USD in just 8 minutes! Other coins that released on the coineal exchange have jumped in value by 120% up to 400% on their first day of trading. 

With coins being released as low as $0.05 a piece anyone is able to join in to invest with very minimal risk, looking at these profit margins I don't see how this could be unattractive to anyone."

Overall, I think this is a good move on their part. The cryptocurrency is going to be something similar to paypal. Backed by USD but treated like a crypto. Probably won't be decentralized. Also the push into eCommerce is a smart one as well. Merchants will probably be able to setup shops on facebook's platform and perhaps facebook will have a part of the platform that is similar to amazon for buying products.

The study has some interesting findings:

* 22% have already had ""some exposure"" to digital assets
* 47% agree that digital assets have a place in their portfolios

Fidelity Digital Assets president Tom Jessop said:

&gt; We’ve seen a maturation of interest in digital assets from early adopters, like crypto hedge funds, to traditional institutional investors like family offices and endowments. 

He also said:

&gt;""More institutional investors are engaging with digital assets, either directly or through service providers, as the potential impact of blockchain technology on financial markets - new and old - becomes more readily apparent.""

For those of you who work at investment firms - have you noticed a similar shift in sentiment toward crypto?

&amp;#x200B;

as a timid noob and generally underfunded fresh-faced investor, i'm wondering if we might open a discussion on lower-cost asset classes. ultimately i'd love to invest in real estate, but i'm not in the position to make a decent down payment. i would imagine there are others such as myself. so, i'm looking for innovative ways to use the money i do have to steadily increase my cashflow.

&amp;#x200B;

other 'asset classes' i've devised thus far:

thrift store items/electronics

yes this falls into r/flipping territory, but i view these as short-term assets in that i can use a little bit of money to turn it into a little bit more money. i find electronics, computer accessories, and collectibles work best for quick profit.

&amp;#x200B;

sneakers

buying new releases and holding onto them then selling for a profit.

&amp;#x200B;

cryptocurrency/stocks

this territory has been covered.

&amp;#x200B;

vending machines

i had a few when i was a young lady, but i'm not sure how this space has evolved since then.

&amp;#x200B;

does anyone have other underappreciated or unnoticed asset classes to share? it could be anything to which a 'buy low sell high' model applies. thanks for your attention you guys are an awesome community."

FB is going to launch its own currency shortly. 

I think this means the stock is undervalued. I don't think the success of the currency is priced in to the current price (and I think there was a bit of an overreaction re the regulation news). Obviously no one can be certain if the currency will be successful but they have worked hard on this and brought in good people to work on it (e.g. former Instagram VP of product) - read the article for more info. 

I also think that FB takes a mature approach to product development, they rarely launch and then instantly kill if adoption is not off the charts on day one (e.g. Watch, Oculus, Portal). I expect this to be the case with the currency.  

So I think FB is a buy today."

**Foreword**

It's clear that cryptocurrencies are gradually making inroads into the global economy, moving closer to mass adoption. Cryptocurrencies offer a number of advantages - decentralization and trust, lower commissions and disintermediation - that make it easier for users to carry out their daily transactions. Anybody can transfer value around the globe, winning from fast processing time.

In comparison, sending value across borders via legacy financial systems requires lengthy waiting periods and fees, while also making users stuck into highly complex processes. For instance, if a person from Japan wants to send some money to England, the fees can range anywhere from 5% up to 10%, depending on the system being used. In addition, there will be some currency conversion fees. It seems that centralized players, currently enjoying lack of competition, set up fees and commissions just as they wish.

And it's merchants that carry out cross-border transactions that find working with legacy finance institutions most troublesome. They keep losing hefty chunks from their potential profits, just paying out fees to payment processors. This makes businesses hike up their prices, passing these expenses to ordinary consumers. Crypto offers a paradigm shift change, bringing to the table lightning speeds and lower fees. Although cryptocurrencies have been winning more and more attention from merchants worldwide, there's still a number of roadblocks to wider adoption, among which are price volatility, scalability limitations and others.

Volatility is admittedly the biggest hurdle that prevents businesses from using cryptocurrencies more. Bitcoin can experience huge fluctuations in just a matter of hours or even minutes. In addition, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum present scalability issues, which results in high processing time. A merchant, who has to handle hundreds of payments on a daily basis, would not be able to conduct their business efficiently if transactions get stuck for days on end. On top of that, it's extremely hard for adopters to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat via the banks and other financial agents they usually work with. 

Cryptocurrencies seek to offer solutions to all of these issues. 

**What is stablecoin?** 

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency, whose architecture enables its price to always equal the price of another asset. Most of the stablecoins are pegged to USD. The biggest names in cryptocurrencies are Tether, Gemini Dollar, USDQ, TUSD and others. 

**How do stablecoins manage to be so stable?**

As opposed to other coins that float freely, stable cryptocurrencies require that each unit is backed with a unit of the fiat currency. For instance, Tether (USDT) pegs 1 USDT to 1 USD on the one-to-one basis. In this way, stablecoins are somewhere between cryptocurrencies and regular fiats. Tether is based on its own blockchain that is built on top of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum systems.

Although Tether is the biggest stablecoin, there's a number of concerns as to its operations. The biggest one is the continuing controversy as to the fiat reserves, which the issuer is supposed to store on the one-to-one ratio to the number of issued Tether units. The company has been saying that the audit will be done in the near future, but just several weeks ago it started to claim that it's not only the cash, but also loans to other companies that can be recorded as fiat reserves. These statements resulted in growing distrust among crypto enthusiasts.

Another project is TrueUSD (TUSD). It also pegs to USD. The difference with Tether is the openness to audits and transparency. The company is open to third-party audits, it publishes the duly verified reports on the fiat reserves it holds. In addition, users enjoy legal protections.

USDC is another stablecoin that was created by the famous cryptocurrency exchange Circle. Just as TUSD, if offers regulatory compliance and transparency. The big problem about all these systems is the fact that they enable authorities to seize users’ funds, which completely negates the very idea of decentralization and anti-censorship, on which crypto is built.

USDQ is different from other stablecoins as it's not backed by the fiat currency, but by Bitcoin and other  top-10 cryptocurrencies in the future. This enables the ecosystem to avoid dealing with legacy financial systems. Through the overcollateralization process, USDQ turns highly volatile cryptocurrencies into the USD-pegged USDQ that is perfect for storing value and processing transactions in the external economy without any risk of price changes. The coin is being developed by PLATINUM ENGINEERING with the small community slowly growing around the project. 

**Why do we need stablecoins?**

Stablecoins have advanced as a new iteration on cryptocurrencies, enabling to address such issues as high volatility and interactions with legacy financial systems. 

Coins like USDQ make sure that various mechanisms are used in order to stabilize the prices at the USD peg. Traders can easily change their Bitcoins into USDQ and thus prevent the negative impact on unwanted prices changes. Stablecoins are very easy to use, which is a boon for non-techy adopters. Any person from around the world can quickly convert fiats into stablecoins, without any need to think about future price changes and without worrying about potential risks for losing their funds. As a rule, you'll always find various stablecoins on crypto exchanges, enabling traders to quickly move around stables and other cryptos. 

As we've spoken above, cross-border payments win most from using the stablecoins. This hybrid species between fiat and crypto will help open up the hidden value in global trade, amounting to trillions of dollars in profits for stakeholders. 

[**USDQ**](https://platinum.fund/usdq/) **is decentralized stablecoin**, which uses algorithms to offer higher stability and reliability.

131,2019-07-13,bolyus21,1,Mapping Out Some Collateral Developments to Blockchain Technology,"Guest Blogger: *Andrew Rossow, Esq.*

Every once and while, a new technology comes around that positively impacts innovation in several fields, even some outside of its initially intended sector. Blockchains, more specifically Bitcoin, is increasingly showing the signs of doing the very same.

From the expansion and further development of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) (ZKPs) to [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#can-snarks-and-starks-help), a seemingly golden age of cryptography, improved privacy, and permissionless financial products have branched out from Bitcoin’s meteoric rise.

ZKPs and a New Era of Privacy

Obviously central to the name “cryptocurrencies,” is the cryptography component that underpins Bitcoin’s transaction scheme and that of the many altcoins. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, which is becoming increasingly clear with the likes of blockchain forensics companies emerging left and right — attracting government support in the process.

However, that realization has led to some fascinating downstream effects in the development of better cryptography.

For example, research into a full-scale implementation of Schnorr Signatures, widely considered to be the best cryptographic signature primitive, [recently materialized](https://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-releases-test-code-for-bitcoin-tech-upgrade-schnorr) into a formal proposal for inclusion into Bitcoin. Dubbed, “MuSig,” Schnorr Signatures would confer better scalability and privacy to the legacy cryptocurrency.

But the innovation does not stop there.

Out of the demand for anonymity came altcoins like Monero and ZCash, predicated on novel cryptographic techniques for completely masking the identities of users and the amounts transferred.

For example, Monero, a “CryptoNote Coin,” leverages the power of ring signatures — a technique for obfuscating the originator of a signed digital message that has been around for years but never applied on the scale as it is with Monero.

Researchers even released a new implementation of formalized ring signatures for enhanced privacy, called [OmniRing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/buumwj/omniring_scaling_up_private_payments_without/), designed to scale up privacy transactions without the feared “trusted setup.” Similarly, the production of “[Bulletproofs](https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/)” out of the famed Stanford Applied Cryptography Group enhanced the efficiency of privacy-preserving transactions, which have historically been data-heavy.

The concept builds on the notion of ZKPs, which have attracted the nickname of “crypto magic” for being unfathomably complex from a mathematical perspective while furnishing near-complete anonymity.

All of these developments, while built on technologies preceding Bitcoin, have accelerated over the last few years. Even banks, like JP Morgan, are joining in on the fun, building their own implementations of ZKPs for private transactions.

The snowballing innovation in the field of cryptography comes at an opportune time. Once hailed by cypherpunks as the [last vestige of hope](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/) against a surveillance state, cryptography is a powerful shield against the repeated data malpractice of tech firms and government snooping.

What began as an era of openly sharing on social media platforms, has spun into a complicated mix of wanting social media but without corporations and governments having access to the data — privacy is now at a premium.

Distributed Computing — Scaling Decentralized Networks

Similar to the rise in cryptography over the last several years, there has been an explosion in distributed computing, particularly scaling decentralized networks. Emerging out of the need for public, permissionless blockchain networks (i.e., Ethereum) to scale better, a confluence of efficiency improvements and innovative technologies are seeking to power public blockchains with the same performance level as their centralized counterparts.

For example, the concept of *sharding* — horizontally partitioning a database — has gained prominence among several platforms, including Ethereum, as a way to enable groups (i.e., shards) of nodes process transactions in parallel. Ethereum’s foray into sharding is known as its Serenity upgrade, which is pending rollout following more extensive research and testing of the underlying concept.

Other projects, like [Elrond](https://elrond.com/), are pushing the envelope even farther. Elrond is working on a bleeding-edge form of state sharding known as “Adaptive State Sharding” in conjunction with their secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Compared to the other forms of sharding, transaction and network, state sharding is the most technically complex and widely considered to have enormous potential in boosting the performance of public blockchains. Elrond implements all three in an ambitious take on scaling decentralized networks.

Take the case of Elrond, whose [Testnet](https://testnet.elrond.com/#/) is already live, and has reached a peak performance capacity of nearly 12,000 transactions per second (TPS). For context, Ethereum’s current iteration process roughly 15 – 20 TPS.

Sharding, similar to the aforementioned privacy technologies, is not a new concept either. Sharding is prevalent for improving database efficiency and has been around for many years. It is only recently that it began garnering attention in crypto circles as a method to improve the scalability of decentralized networks.

The sheer scale of development of sharding applied to distributed networks is nothing short of impressive so far.

The convergence of technologies like sharding with new consensus designs, like PoS, is sure to usher in a new generation of blockchains, supplemented by better privacy and scalability. It is not surprising that such developments have flown under the radar, as they are highly esoteric, but their downstream advantages for mainstream consumers and app users are promising.

Bitcoin may have birthed a spectacular invention of money, but its collateral effects in the form of distributed computing and cryptography may come to have a more dynamic impact on society than a P2P digital currency.

135,2019-07-11,XCOEX,1,A simplified cryptocurrency exchange,"The appreciation in the number of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges is intended to bring about transparency and decentralization in the market.

According to Alex Altgauzen, COO of cryptocurrency exchange XCOEX:

*“The importance of decentralizing this market is massive. The market is still in its infancy. A small number of exchanges controlling the market could eventually result in a centralized catastrophe that we were all trying to avoid in the first place.”*

[**XCOEX**](https://xcoex.com/) is currently running a daily contest till June 30, in an effort to attract new investors.

Altgauzen points out that the rise of such smaller exchanges is a boon to the community as a whole:

*“Spreading investors among many exchange platforms is crucial at this point. We all remember the MtGox hack and the resulting negative effects throughout the industry.”*

Opportunities for small exchanges to emerge, grow and thrive are abundant. This is due to the growing lack of trust in larger “centralized” cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors are likely to notice and leverage small exchanges for investing in digital assets. Additionally, it is now easier to launch an exchange.

For example, another new blockchain business, Spotware, offers out of the box exchange platforms for anyone looking to launch an exchange. By reducing some of the startup costs exchanges typically face, Spotware too is opening doors to decentralization.

What happened in the market to create this deep need for smaller exchanges, DEX, and other, less powerful alternatives?

The explosive growth of Binance and other large crypto exchanges. They were launched only with the sole purpose of creating a market monopoly for themselves.

144,2019-08-22,rumplebottom,10,"Digital assets and ""internet properties""","In the mid-2000s, it was a viable strategy to invest in digital assets of various sorts. One for example was domain trading/speculation, where you invest in domains (.com, .net, .org were the main ones, before the hundreds that exist now). There was actually a whole market around it. Another was ""flipping"" websites in the same way that you flip properties, or building ""internet properties"" from scratch -- here the meaning was mostly landing pages that were heavily SEO oriented with the sole purpose of bringing traffic for selling adspace (e.g. for several years a popular search term was ""asbestos"" and then there were thousands of one-pagers filled with words about it). Real content websites required more solid investment but also brought in potential revenue streams. 

My question is - does anyone still invest in the oldschool stuff? Today it's all about cryptocurrency, multi-million dollar seed startups and eCommerce. Does anyone still broker domain deals or build landing pages / SEO-oriented article websites? 

All thoughts, opinions, examples and experience are welcome."
145,2019-08-21,ZaadNek,0,Invest in the next big thing after bitcoin (if any),"So, what are your bets?

Personally I think bitcoin will survive, because the big money likes it. Bitcoin has the name and proven to be secure for 10 years now. But I don't believe in all those other public blockchain projects. They shout a lot, but even in this early stage of adoption they already suffer from performing. And be honest, which other project do you use yourself? Blockchain is not user friendly at all. And all those tricks to make it perform, makes it less decentralised which is the whole point of bitcoin.

So if I have to pick a project that can be the next big thing. I would pick a project with no blockchain at all! But something different, still unique, technical superior and it must have a lot of potential to beat the current king.

From all the non-blockchain projects I know of, I think the SAFE Network(MAID) is the best candidate.  [https://medium.com/safenetwork](https://medium.com/safenetwork)  It's a complete decentralised anonymous data/communications network(unique!) which has its own consensus mechanism called PARSEC(technical superior!). This one is much faster than blockchain and scales very well by design. On top of this network you can build anything you can do on the current internet(lot of potential!). It is easy to use because you can use webbrowsers/apps on PC or phone to access the network, just you are used to right now. 

It will have its own cryptocurrency(private and realtime transactions) which is kinda backed by the data and services on the network. Which makes it valuable as well.

An unique project, but very big and ambitious. Still in development. So there is risk, but risk means high rewards.

What do you think? Any other candidates?"

The People’s Bank of China is “close” to issuing its own cryptocurrency, according to a senior official.

The bank’s researchers have been working intensively since last year to develop systems, and the cryptocurrency is “close to being out,” Mu Changchun, deputy director of the PBOC’s payments department, said at an event held by China Finance 40 Forum over the weekend in Yichun, Heilongjiang. He didn’t give specifics on the timing.

The remarks signal the PBOC is inching toward formally introducing a digital currency of its own after five years of research. Facebook Inc.’s push to create cryptocurrency Libra has caused concerns among global central banks, including the PBOC, which said the digital asset must be put under central bank oversight to prevent potential foreign exchange risks and protect the authority of monetary policy."

158,2019-09-16,Mobilenewsflash,0,Invest in Small Coins: Best Unknown Cryptocurrency 2019,"Bitcoin made numerous early investors millionaires, rich beyond their wildest dreams and their lives changed forever. After Bitcoin, others saw similar riches investing in coins like Ripple, Nano, and Ethereum.

Of course, it’s now too late to invest in Bitcoin, Ripple, Nano, or Ethereum and see the same gains that the first investors got. “Gem hunters”, people who look for the next massive gains, are looking for little known coins with potential to net 100-1000x gains.

Finding the Best Crypto Coin to Invest In

In searching for the best possible investment with the potential for the greatest gains, there are several pertinent criteria that must be met. The perfect choice is a unique coin that looks to provide a utility not yet achieved by Bitcoin or other altcoins.

Some of the qualities of the perfect moonshot are as follows:

Cheap Price Point

Small Market Cap

No ICO

Dedicated Team

Strong Community

Most importantly: Legitimate Service and Real Utility

With that, our choice as the next moonshot is…

Best Small Cap Coin for 2019: Nyzo

Nyzo is very new, having just launched in December 2018. The coin is not yet listed on CoinMarketCap, which means it has flown under everyone’s radar until now.

The purpose of this crypto coin is to create a mesh network. This is a unique utility not possible through Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other coins.

A mesh network is a type of internet framework in which participants share resources with one another. This enables them to build bandwidth through one another, versus relying on a centralized Internet Service provider (ISP).

There is huge demand for mesh network infrastructure in areas where service providers are dangerous or predatory. Recently, a meshnet by protestors In Hong Kong, has risen as go-to medium for messaging as it cannot be shut down by Chinese government forces.

Nyzo operates through its novel “Proof-of-Diversity” mechanism. In essence, each participant in Nyzo further bolsters the mesh network. They are rewarded for their participation as they contribute to the greater diversity of the network. The better diversity, the stronger the network.

Nyzo is the only blockchain coin in the world that operates under this system.

Trading Nyzo

Each Nyzo coin trades for roughly $0.20. With a --at the time of writing-- circulating supply of 7,950,000, the market cap is only 1.9 million. Keep in mind that coins like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple are worth tens of billions of dollars.

Nyzo was launched fairly, there was no ICO and the founders do not control a portion of the supply. This indicates that there are no major entities that are looking for a quick return on investment.

Right now, there is a passionate community silently building out and accumulating Nyzo. In its current phase, the coin looks similar to RaiBlocks crypto coin when it was only trading for fractions of a penny. Months later, it traded for over $35.

Nyzo holders are anticipating gains in the tune of thousands of times return on investment. While the cryptocurrency is still a hidden gem, it’s the perfect time to buy in.

If you bought $100 worth of Nyzo today, and it grew to become a top 20 coin, you would then have somewhere around $100,000.

Where to Buy Nyzo

The best exchange to buy Nyzo is QTrade. This is the perfect exchange because they are regulated in the United States but do not require users to verify their identity.

The exchange features little known, innovative coins, which makes it a perfect fit for trading Nyzo.

Keeping your Coins Safe

Once you’ve purchased your Nyzo, it’s imperative to take the proper measures to ensure they are safe from hackers. Keep the following safety precautions in mind:

Use a different password between your trading accounts and emails.

Always enable two-factor authentication.

Secure your coins in your own wallet, not on a website.

Don’t tell others about the amount of coins you own.

Be patient!

Once you’ve secured your Nyzo investment, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll start to see appreciation of your crypto coin."

163,2019-09-10,Mindreactions,5,Blockchain Projects to Watch in 2019,"# These blockchain projects may stay out of your radars since not all of them were actively advertised. However, we can say with confidence that these projects are worth paying attention to in 2019.

It is always necessary to keep abreast of trends that occur in the cryptocurrency world. Many crypto advocates and traders called the year 2018 “crypto winter” after prices fell from their historic highs to critical lows. But with the onset of spring 2019, everything has changed.

The bull market has returned and [Bitcoin](https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/), the father of all cryptocurrencies, has undoubtedly started this race. Now it is the end of August and many crypto enthusiasts foreshadow the recurrence of the events of autumn 2017.

Top 5 coins that will be considered below may stay out of your radars since not all of these digital assets were previously known and actively advertised. But we can say with confidence that these projects have the technology and they are worth paying attention to by the end of 2019.

Several criteria were used for the following compilation among which are:

* Technology. Foundations of technology development. In particular, a number of disruptive technologies they offer.
* Business. Large partnerships with industry giants, which will further facilitate blockchain adoption across the world.
* Community. Community activity in terms of cumulative total audience across social media.
* Media coverage. Exciting and ambitious PR activities that a company has organized for the course of a year.
* Price Charts. The token price: it shouldn’t be overrated or highly underrated (volume/market cap ratio variable), and there is potential for growth.

## Chainlink

Undoubtedly, we can distinguish [Chainlink](https://chain.link/). The project there was a lot of talks about throughout the summer of 2019. Starting in January 2019, the price of this coin increased by more than 10 times and brought huge profits to investors who invested in the project in the early stages of investment.

This project is traded on all major exchanges and has good volumes near $ 80 million. Chainlink is an input and output service that provides a reliable connection to external data that is provably secure end-to-end. This technology is very popular in the market since input and output services serve as data channels for smart contracts. There were many events related to Chainlink, which contributed to the rapid growth of the coin. Key events were the partnership with Google and listing on Coinbase Pro.

## Quant

The second project worth paying attention to is [Quant](https://www.quant.network/). Like the previous one, Quant has had good growth rates since the beginning of 2019. It was named “Cool Vendor in Blockchain Technology” by Gartner. Quant Network is a pioneering technology company combining cybersecurity, industry and government experience to develop advanced technologies enabling trusted interactions between companies and their customers. Quant Network is recognized for having solved interoperability through the creation of blockchain operating system.

This project has a partnership with SIA, the European leader in the design, creation, and management of technology infrastructures and services for Financial Institutions, Central Banks, Corporates and the Public Sector, in the areas of payments, cards, network services, and capital markets.

SIA Group provides its services in 50 countries and manages over 50 billion financial transactions per year. This partnership will help the company’s development and bring the widespread introduction of Quant technology.

## Credits

The next project that you should pay attention to in 2019 is [Credits](https://credits.com/), in the last 10 days, this project has risen by more than 200 positions and is currently at 150 position on CMC. This project has great potential. During 2019 it entered into partnerships with more than 30 companies – system integrators, who will present their solutions based on Credits blockchain technology to their end customers.

With many small and medium-sized partners around the world, Credits also works with industry giants such as IBM and Lenovo. During 2019, the company has been actively engaged in completing the development of its own blockchain platform and has released the first dapps and services based on it.

Credits plans to make a token swap by the end of 2019. Among the news, that contributed to such rapid growth, we can distinguish the token swap coming and recently announced AMA session with such well-known projects like Matic Network, QuarkChain, and Holochain.

## Cosmos

[Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/), sponsored by the Interchain Foundation (ICF), was founded to “facilitate the next generation of Blockchain technology” and to create an Internet of blockchains. Cosmos unites all types of blockchains, taking advantage of Tendermint and Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC). Projects linked or embedded in the Cosmos Network can exchange tokens directly.

Cosmos is a network for better compatibility between all types of blockchains. The idea of ​​creating the project came to developers back in 2017. In April 2017, developers managed to raise $ 17 million in less than 30 minutes. The initial value of the token on the ICO was $ 0.1. The maximum cost of 1 ATOM reached $ 8. Even though the project was launched in 2017, token listings on cryptocurrency exchanges happened recently, namely in March 2019.

## Matic Network

Let’s not lose sight of the Matic cryptocurrency, released by the [Matic Network](https://matic.network/) project, which enlisted the support of [Coinbase](https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/) and implemented exchange placement on the Binance Launchpad. The cryptocurrency jumped by 75% per day and burst into the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of the daily trading volume.

The little-known Matic token managed to overcome the bearish mood that took place on the cryptocurrency market in early 2019 when Bitcoin could not hold above $ 8,000 and jumped in price by more than one and a half times, which allowed it to enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by capitalization.

Matic also has received funding from Coinbase Ventures, an American crypto holding. The partnership will allow Matic to integrate another cryptocurrency supported by Coinbase – [USD Coin](https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/usd-coin/) – into its side chains. On the other hand, Coinbase wallet users will be able to use the Matic network to transfer and trade digital assets. The Matic Network is a set of tools for scaling with extra-chain and side chains for existing blockchains such as Ethereum, to improve the level of user interaction through dApps.

# Conclusion

We can say for sure that it does not matter if 2019 repeats the events of 2017. All of the above-mentioned projects have a solid technical foundation for implementing their technology, which will create the demand for tokens and increase their utility in the long-term. Cross-chain operations, decentralized Oracle, interoperability solutions, fast transactions, and exceptional scalability would foster the whole blockchain industry as they would be leveraged by multinational corporations.

The five projects managed to get published on pages of leading crypto outlets and get significant social media coverage since 2019.

Besides, they hit Top-150 (according to [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)) and showed an outstanding performance in terms of ROI and/or later price gains. Anyway, one shouldn’t forget about the risk/return ratio before investing in any crypto"
164,2019-09-05,robertmdesmond,5,Is cryptocurrency a viable alternative to negative interest rates?,"Negative yielding bonds and negative interest rate policies are spreading. On Aug. 7 2019, the world had $15 trillion in negative yield debt \[1\] and by Aug. 26, 2019, that number had jumped to $17 trillion.\[2\]

Are cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, etc. a reasonable alternative? Yes, there is currency volatility, but at least it's not a guaranteed loss. And value could just as likely increase as decrease. Thoughts?

Edit. Please don't just list the risks of crypto but be specific *relative* to negative yielding debt please."
165,2019-09-03,risk_parity,5,Structuring an endowment portfolio for non-profit organization that appeals to all stake-holders.,"Greetings all, 

Recently accepted an appointment to an executive/finance committee on a board of directors for a regional non-profit. There is an existing endowment fund (low eight-figures) and a new executive director and incoming board president and they want to move the endowment to a new advisor and custodian. I was tasked to take a look and make some recommendations. 

The portfolio is overly complex, in my opinion, AUM fees are in excess of 1.25% in addition to front load funds and actively managed funds. There's about 12 actively managed funds in the endowment fund in addition to over 40 individual stock tickers, 5 ETFs, and a bunch of bond and CD ladders. If I didn't know any better I would guess that the fund and stock selections are window dressing. Asset allocation for the endowment are something along the lines of 50/40/10. Performance is ok, but fees and expenses of around 2.5% are really dragging down performance when you look at it from a 5-year or 10-year timeline.

I proposed moving to a lower cost firm that could offer 0.3% AUM (based on available information online) and simplifying the portfolio to a lazy portfolio. My initial recommendations included a 3-fund, 4-fund and 5-fund portfolio. I did enough backtesting with the current endowment and my 3 proposed allocations to show that we could easily match the performance before fees in addition to pocketing another 1.5 - 2% year over year from reduced expenses by using index funds and having access to institutional shares. Also the new setup would easily fulfill the mandate of generating 5% returns without having to draw down the principal using a three-year rolling average to help model cash outflows and inflows. 

When I presented my findings, I was told by several board members that my portfolio for the endowment wasn't sophisticated enough and that I must have been missing out on something crucial. 

I was asked to work with some other board members, who are accredited investors, to come up with a more sophisticated asset allocations to “maximize upward potential but maintain capital preservation” and also look at some other firms that can provide exclusive advice and guidance. We've done one working session so far but it's left me a bit concerned. Suggestions from the session included cryptocurrency, hedge funds, private equity, VIX funds, holding physical gold in the main office, and buying up vacant property around HQ. I guess the word is out on the street because we are also getting inundated with offers for lunch or dinner with various advisory firms, banks, and wealth managers. 

As a compromise, I'm hoping to construct a portfolio that's 90% lazy (using David Swensen Yale portfolio as a baseline) and maybe window dress the remaining 10% with individual holdings and exotic ETFs to placate other internal stakeholders. Also I want to figure out a way to construct an endowment, or revise the bylaws governing the endowment, that's a bit more insulated from leadership changes or advisors. There's effectively a new board of directors every four years at the organization and this would have been the 4th time in 20 years that the endowment has been reconstructed. 

I was looking to see if anyone here has had experience setting up an endowment or legacy fund for a non-profit and what strategies or tactics did they find successful to build consensus and more importantly survive the turnover within the leadership of the organization. I feel like I really underestimated the “people” aspect of endowment investing. 

P.S. the advisor emailed me and some other board members in a panic offering to take us out to lunch and reminding us he moved us to cash during the last 2 market pullbacks. He is also emailing former board members that rolled off to see what the deal was with me, and the new leadership in general."

167,2019-10-31,Adam-HT,1,Automated low / high risk strategy,"Hi guys,   


I have been investing for a shorter period (a few years), my commitment, interest and strategies have varied greatly over time.  
A common trap I end up in is that I want to try everything. There are usually small sums here and small sums there. And by the way, there will be very little scattered progress that may not justify what an overall big effort would make.

I recently went from being interested in peer to peer lending. To a Swedish service called [Lysa](https://lysa.se/bli-kund?inbjudan=6VtqVQ7BTFWZv3HjZVAGcQ). Lysa is really an automated fund service. Which packages cheap but good funds and gives suggestions on investment strategies. They also rebalance the portfolio for me so all I really need to do is save monthly and add extra money when I can.

At Lysa I use something called 4 buckets strategy. Some of you may have heard of it before. It is really about having 3 accounts with each strategy. When that note is full, the money spills over to the next account (bucket).

So my strategy is:

**Bucket 1: 2-3 monthly salaries (30% shares &amp; 70% interest)**  
**Bucket 2: 3-7 monthly salaries (60% shares &amp; 40% interest)**  
**Bucket 3: the rest of my money (100% shares &amp; 0% interest)**  


So refilling takes place from buckets 1 to 3 and if I need my money I also take from buckets 1 to 3. Should I then have money in bucket 3, these are replenished from buckets 3 to 1.

&amp;#x200B;

But let's not get caught up with Lysa, it's just a thought-provoking strategy for managing the large share of my money. Something else that interests me is Bitcoin. You don't have to believe in Bitcoin, you may like or hate it. But Bitcoin is part of my high risk strategy. This is also where my question comes to you.  


So to supplement my defensive savings, I invest a bit in Bitcoin. Something that caught my eye lately is [Celsius](https://celsiusnetwork.app.link/183626a6f9) and other forms of cryptocurrency loan platforms. The idea there is to earn interest on Bitcoin. It exposes my already risky investment to even more risk as the risk of losing my Bitcoins increases dramatically as they leave my hardware wallet.  


I understand that there are not really any right answers here. But I would like to hear what you think of this. Someone may have suggestions for improvement. I want my money to be able to work for me at all times. Although we are entering an economic downturn. I am very risk averse but have realized that it is of no benefit.  


So tell me, what do you think of this strategy and how would you like to change it? both technically and fundamentally.  


( *I have attached affiliate links to both Celsius and Lysa. The main focus is to discuss the investment strategy itself and not to market any of these platforms. But if anyone has questions about these platforms, I can to some extent answer them too.* )"

179,2019-10-03,SkyTexBlockchain,1,Trading and Arbitrage in Cryptocurrency Markets," 

Cryptocurrency markets exhibit periods of large, recurrent arbitrage opportunities across exchanges. These price deviations are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of capital controls for the movement of arbitrage capital.

**SkyTex** is successfully engaged in arbitrage trading through the use of our algorithm. The ALGO tracks the diﬀerence in the rate of one trading pair on diﬀerent exchanges and concludes deal at the right time.

As a general rule, arbitrage is when you buy and sell an asset at pretty much the same time to make a profit from the price difference. Essentially, buy low, sell high, but simultaneously.

As an arbitrage trader, the more volatile an asset is, the bigger the price differences, and therefore the more profit you can make. Arbitrage turns crypto-currency trading, a traditionally risky investment, into a low-risk venture that generates consistent profit.

With simultaneous buying and selling, Our PROFIT in such transaction is the diﬀerence between the rate where there is NO risk.

In conclusion, Arbitrage over the cryptocurrency markets is a very, very profitable way to trade, if you know what you’re doing. Remember, these markets are still relatively young and that’s why **SkyTex** steps in to make the wins for you with less STRESS. Get in early, before the opportunities dry up."

So it’s important to get the basics right because you lose your money when you make mistakes.

184,2019-11-20,overview12,1,Stablecoins: What You Need to Know,"Stablecoins reside at the intersection of cryptocurrencies and traditional finance. They simplify the transfer of funds between crypto exchanges. Stablecoins make purchases faster and less expensive and are used as a medium of exchange, a means of storing value, and a unit of account. In 2012, Mastercoin proposed a stable-value cryptocurrency, which was later renamed as Omni.

A collateralized stablecoins is pegged to assets such as national currencies, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. In centralized models, the stablecoin issuers back the value of their coin by holding the asset.

A Stablecoin’s value is pegged, for instance, to the USD at a 1:1 fixed exchange rate. Other stablecoins are pegged to the price of crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, with algorithms that manage supply and demand of the coin and the reserves. Regardless of how a stablecoin is backed, its value is in its price stability.

In a crypto-collateralized arrangement, a cryptocurrency backs a stablecoin, while seigniorage tokens are not collateralized by anything other than software, which maintains the price stability. A hybrid stablecoin might blend the three above approaches.

**Fiat-backed Stablecoin**

Fiat-backed stablecoins are backed by fiat currencies at a 1:1 ratio. Custodians manage the fiat in such an arrangement by holding the proper amount of backing currency in an account. Fiat-backed tokens can be issued or destroyed by the custodian as needed to maintain the peg. Stablecoins today are backed by the euro, Japanese yen, and other fiat currencies. Of course, stablecoins where funds are held in bank accounts or by third-parties are susceptible to fraud.

A problem with fiat-backed stablecoins is their centralization.

**Commodity-Backed Stablecoin**

Commodity-backed stablecoins are pegged to a commodity, such as gold or silver. A token could be backed by one gram of gold stored in a third-party custodian’s vaults.

These stablecoins are backed by one or more commodities. The backing commodity must reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin.

**Cryptocurrency-Backed Stablecoin**

A Crypto-collateralized stablecoin is backed by a cryptocurrency and sometimes a basket thereof. Certain mathematical innovations were needed in order to make such a stablecoin possible. These stablecoins are considered a more decentralized alternative to other stablecoins.

A major difference between this type of stablecoin and the abovementioned types is the former is handled on blockchain, with smart contracts, where the latter are done in the physical world through bank accounts or gold custodians.

These stablecoins are oftentimes more complex and require more collateral, due to the volatile nature of the backing cryptocurrencies themselves, than the abovementioned stablecoins.

**Seigniorage-Style Stablecoin**

A seigniorage-Style stablecoin is stabilized by an algorithm. The algorithm could, for instance, control the supply of the seigniorage-style stablecoin. New stablecoins can be minted to stabilize prices if demand for the stablecoin increases.

**Libra, JPMorgan Coin &amp; The Stablecoin Market**

Big institutions have shown interest in creating their own stablecoins. Facebook’s Libra is a stablecoin, because the social networking site sees stablecoins as a potential bridge between the existing world of government-issued money and a crypto-based future.

Stablecoins are also gaining attention from the likes of JPMorgan Chase Inc. According to Facebook, Libra will be backed by “a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.” Libra’s value will fluctuate in the same manner that the US dollar varies compared with the euro or yen from day-to-day. Exchanges will be established so that users can convert fiat for Libra.

JP Morgan says its JPM coin will enable fast money transfers between its corporate customers on an internal, private blockchain. JPM Coin is backed by the U.S. dollars held by the bank.

The Federal Reserve has been advised to [consider](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/central-bankers-told-they-should-be-sprinting-toward-blockchain) stablecoins, and the central bank of Sweden is planning a pilot project with an “e-krona” later this year.

**Money on Chain: A Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoin**

Money on Chain foresees big things for stablecoins, too. That’s why in 2015 we started to work on a stablecoin for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

We chose to design a stablecoin on top of Bitcoin because it allowed us to build a truly decentralized stablecoin. We believe Bitcoin’s decentralization and censorship resistance is crucial to a stablecoin.

We’ve created a stablecoin pegged to the American Dollar (Dollar On Chain) that incentivizes various participants in the Bitcoin systems.

Money On Chain is made by Bitcoiners for Bitcoiners.

188,2019-11-18,lnneidig,1,"If I'm looking to build financial freedom for myself with cryptocurrencies, what should I do?","**My answer to the Quora question above:**

Investing in cryptocurrencies can be a great way for you to make a profit. However, investing in cryptocurrencies can still carry some risks with it. Learning how to reduce your risks as much as possible can make it so much easier for you to earn a profit, without having to worry about potential losses as much.

**Pickout one strategy:** Picking out a good strategy to work with will make all the difference when it comes to trading in digital currencies. There are many strategies that you can use, and the one you work with will often depend on your chosen cryptocurrency as well as with whether you wish to invest short-term or long-term. All of the strategies have the potential to make you money as long as you use them properly.

**Understand the currency you are working with:** Since all of these currencies work in different ways, it is important that you fully understand the way that your currency works before you join in. You need to know something about the currency and how it works.

**Diversify your portfolio:** Diversifying your portfolio means that you will put your money into at least two different investment types. The more investments that you can do at once, the less risk you are taking on. Another benefit of diverisification is that it can help protect you from yourself. Your crypto wealth is less likely to have large swings in value when it's diversified, so you are less likely to let your emotions guide your investment decisions.

**Ask for help:** Asking for help from someone who knows what they are doing, rather than trying to figure it all out on your own, can be the best way for you to lean how to invest properly.

**Keep the emotions away from the investment:** Keeping your emotions out of your investment if so important if you want to actually earn money. Emotions get in the way and make it almost impossible to make sound decisions on any of your investments.

**Have an exit strategy:** You should make sure that you have an exit strategy right from the beginning. This can help you to keep your emotions out of the game from the beginning and will make it easier for you to stick with your plan rather than losing money.

Investing in cryptocurrencies can be financially rewarding, but it's also risky. With the right crypto index strategy, you can try to reduce all the risks as much as possible.

In early 2017 we decided to design an index for the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. An independent team of mathematicians, quants and fund managers lead by **Igor Rivin**, Professor of Mathematics at Temple University and Whitehead prize winner 1998, and **Carlo Scevola**, economist and president of CS&amp;P.

The purpose of this index would be twofold:

**1)** It would be a kind of a barometer for the cryptocurrency market.

**2)** It would be an investment vehicle which would allow an investor to participate in the growth potential of the cryptocurrency space and ultimately help them to achieve financial freedom.

We have decided to use top 20+ cryptocurrencies by market capitalization - the currencies below this cutoff are not very liquid and the top 20+ capture 90% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. The constituents of the index are weighted proportionally to the square root of their market capitalizations.

The index is completely rebalanced every quarter, and reweighed every month. This is necessitated by the rapid evolution of the cryptocurrency market.

The index is available at [Libertypool](https://libertypool.com/), a borderless crypto investment platform. At [Libertypool.com](http://libertypool.com/), you can start investing in the index from $500. From the beginning of 2015, the performance of the Libertypool index fund is up by around 7000%. In the same period, Bitcoin, by contrast, is up some 2500%.

I believe in the future of cryptocurrencies. So the best way to achieve financial freedom through cryptocurrency is to invest in a best risk-adjusted, high performance and diversified crypto index fund like this."

Since 2013, Bitcoin has generated most of its annual performance *in just ten days of the year.* When the top 10 days of gains for each year since 2013 are removed, Bitcoin would actually be down -25%. So, the most important moments in Bitcoin’s history effectively happen in the blink of an eye compared to the rest of the calendar year.

190,2019-11-17,InPennyStock15-19,1,Is the RobinHood App Giving to the Poor?,"There are many trading apps available online for investors, along with online brokerages and exchanges.

There are **endless options** to trade everything from ETFs (exchange-traded funds) to stocks, penny stock trading and even trade in cryptocurrencies. 

**One of the fastest-growing apps is the RobinHood app**, which has grown tremendously since its launch in 2013. 

* The most significant selling point of this App is its **commission-free structure** in which you don’t have to pay a fee to execute trades. 

### What is the Robinhood app?

 It is a **free trading app** which is **ideal for investors** who want to trade *options*, *stocks*, *exchange-traded funds* as well as for *cryptocurrencies*, **without paying any form of commission or fees**. 

* This is a new and innovative service that *cuts out almost all types of costs associated with investing*. 

However, **there is a tradeoff** for it being a free service. 

* Even  though it offers both mobile and web trading, the platforms are almost  bare-bones and many investors may find the range of the tradeable  securities and account options very basic, without much choice.

**Some features of the RobinHood app include**:

Frequent stock, ETF and option trading

Margin accounts

Individual taxable accounts

Provides a unique platform for mobile users

Useful for those who want to trade in cryptocurrencies

# Why Use the RobinHood App?

### Commissions

This point is pretty obvious. 

Most people would be tempted to use this service because **it is free**. 

The app gives a *commitment to providing 100% commission-free stocks, options, ETFs and cryptocurrency trading*  which means there can be considerable savings for the investors who  don’t want to pay additional cost in the form of fees or commissions.

* This is the right choice for those who trade frequently.

This means every dollar that you save can be added to your returns.

### Low Costs

The RobinHood app also provides a commitment to **keeping other investor costs as low as possible**. 

To that end, they recently took a big step when they launched **Clearing by RobinHood**. 

* This allows the RobinHood App service to operate on its clearing system, which ends up *reducing many of the account fees of the service*. 

For  example, broker-assisted phone trades, which were previously available  for $15 could be free now, and the bank reversal charges can be reduced  to $10 from $30. 

### No Account Minimum

The RobinHood app **does not require any minimum account** for the investors to keep, which means the investors can get started right away with whatever they have. 

But you do need to have enough to purchase the stock you have your eyes on (there is a *regulation by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority* that you need to know about which requires a minimum of $2,000 portfolio balance to open a margin account).

### Easy to Use

One of the best parts of the RobinHood app is that it **is very user-friendly**. 

If you are used to smartphones, you would surely find the process of their *sign up* and account funding quite *straightforward and simple*. 

* It all takes place inside the app, only in **a matter of minutes**. 
* It requires the user to answer a few questions through which it can gather your *personal information* along with your *contact details*, *social security number*, and your *means of funding* the account. 

According to the company, the **users who are approved are informed in less than one hour,** after which they can initiate their bank transfers. 

* The app also uses *instant verification with some of the major banks*, which relives users the hassle of reporting their micro-deposits to another account to verify the information. 

There is a **limit of $1,000 of bank transfers that are available instantly** for investing, as well as proceeds worth $1,000 from the sale of stock. 

*Deposits more than this amount, however, may take at least 4-5 working days for processing*. 

The  users may set up automatic deposits as per their need or convenience,  which can be weekly, fortnightly, monthly, or even quarterly.

### Streamlined Interface

This service *does not offer a large variety of options*, but for investors who know what they want, this platform is more than enough for their needs to **execute their trades quickly**.

* It supports **limit orders**, **market orders**, **stop-limit orders** as well as **stop orders**.

There is also a feature called ""collections"" available both on mobile and the web. 

* *These are the stocks that are organized as per the sector or category*, for example, companies with female CEOs or entertainment companies, etc. 

On the web, the collections can be sorted, and it allows the users to make a comparison of stocks side by side.

The RobinHood app has recently introduced a new tab bar at the bottom of the app which **offers quick access to portfolio values**, **transaction history**, **watch lists**, and **account statements**.

# Where Does RobinHood Fall Short? 

###  Limited Options in Securities

**There are no bonds or mutual funds**. 

There are also **no automatic dividend reinvestment options**, which means that the dividends are credited to the accounts as cash, rather than having an option for reinvestment. 

The company does plan to offer this in the future.

### One Account Option

For the purpose of investment, **RobinHood only supports individual taxable accounts**, also known as brokerage accounts. 

For  many investors, investing through these accounts come only after they  have invested at least 10-15% of their taxable income for retirement in a  tax-advantaged account such as the IRA or 401(k). 

### Customer Support

One of the essential features lacking at RobinHood is that there is **absolutely no phone support**, and all *customer support is done exclusively through email*. 

* The company does not have any phone numbers either. 

However, their **online help center is quite helpful** and useful and the website is also entirely transparent and easy to navigate. 

###  Is RobinHood Right for You?

Many people are suspicious when it comes to any online service that is free. 

Quite often, there are hidden fees or costs that creep up into your accounts at a later date. 

* This app service, however, **is genuinely free**, and the investors can trade all they want without spending a dime in commissions or fees.

So,  RobinHood can be a solid choice for you if you are ready to give up on  notable research, advanced trading tools and a full range of investment  options for limiting your costs. 

If you are new to investing in penny stocks RobinHood is a great and free resource to utilize as an investor."

KEY POINTS
- Ninety-five percent of spot bitcoin trading volume is faked by unregulated exchanges, according to a study from Bitwise this week. 

-The firm analyzed the top 81 crypto exchanges by volume on industry site CoinMarketCap.com. They report an aggregated $6 billion in average daily bitcoin volume. The study finds that only $273 million of that is legitimate. 

-""People looked at cryptocurrency and said this market is a mess; that's because they were looking at data that was manipulated,"" says Matthew Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise. ""When you cut away the echo chamber of these nonsense numbers, it should be an efficient, well-arbitraged market.""

- The analysis showed that ""substantially all of the volume"" reported on 71 out of the 81 exchanges was wash trading, a term that describes a person simultaneously selling and buying the same stock, or bitcoin in this case, to create the appearance of activity in the market. In other words, it's not real."

204,2019-12-24,HTwrestler112,1,Do mining companies hold reserves of the resource they mine?,"I would like to know if any mining companies hold reserves of the resource they mine. For instance, do gold miners hold any significant amount of gold for speculative purposes during periods of positive sentiment toward gold prices or do they predominantly sell as a rule as they mine no matter the market sentiment/price? I know that gold mining companies will sometimes hedge against volatility/drops in prices by selling futures contracts on gold that is expected to be mined, so in the case of hedging, I wouldn't think it would make sense for a gold mining company to hold substantial reserves of gold given that the futures contract is essentially ""accelerating"" the sale of the gold before it's even completely mined/processed for sale. My primary reason for this question is that I often see cryptocurrency miners speculate by holding substantial amount of mined cryptocurrency and only selling in the short term to cover operating expenses while holding most of the mined cryptocurrency and attempting to sell with market cycles. I have always thought that this choice is foolish given that the operation of a mining business is a separate question from whether or not to have exposure to the speculative risk of holding cryptocurrency. I would like to know how mature industries like mineral mining, etc. choose to address this question as I think they probably have a methodology that has been established over hundreds of years and may be more established than the approach of some cryptocurrency miners."

208,2019-12-18,arcticglobalwin,1,Is the new cryptocurrency PI Network another scam or legit?,"I have always been very skeptical and distant from all the hype around digital currency in general due to my basic investment principle that when everyone on the street starts talking about an investment product, it is generally too late to invest in it. It is in this state of mind that I listen to a family friend who tried for months to encourage me to join his cryptocurrency investment group. He got my attention when he mentioned that this one is a new innovation which is at the free distribution phase with no financial commitment required.

As soon as I reached home, I started making some background research on the Pi Network and found that not only it is a very legitimate and innovative digital currency initiative, but more importantly, it is still at the right stage to jump in with an excellent risk reward ratio. Of course, there is no guaranty that it will be a successful project, but what you tent to lose is a few minutes a day of hitting a button on your mobile and the mobilization of your network of friend and family at no financial cost to you or them for a possible reward of amassing lot of Pi digital currencies that could be very valuable in the future if the project is successful. Below is the summary of the findings of my research on the PI Network and my recommendation.

1. It is a project credited to three Stanford University PHDs namely: Dr Nicolas Kokkalls (head of technology), Dr Chengdiao Fan (Head of product) and Vincent McPhillip (head of community)

2. The company only offers a service, but no product. After downloading the Pi Network app, you need to confirm that you are a human by pressing a lightning symbol on the app at 24 hours intervals. This will initiate the mining process at a predetermined rate on your mobile device (currently 0.20pi/hr) without draining your phone battery. You are free to exit the app after that action without discontinuing the mining process.

3.  It is an FREE App. Free to download (with no ads) either from google play or apple [store.You](https://store.You) may search pi, pinetwork,or minepi

4. Members can join only on invitation from other members. You can accelerate your mining rate by inviting other members to join using your code. You are welcome to use mine to join if you decide to or if this review add any value to you (cakzxd).

5. After three successful mining cycles of 24 hours each, you qualify to become a contributor and you can form a security circle of 3 to 5 trusted members. This will accelerate your mining rate as well.

6. The mining rate has been halve for any multiple of 10 members that the network achieved. The project started in March 2019 at a rate of 3.1 Pi/hr and in November 2019 the network reached 1 million members and the current rate is 0.20 pi/hr.

7. The next milestone is at 10million members and it is not yet clear if the mining process will be discontinued at that stage or if it will continue to reduce in speed.

8. On Pi network white paper, a summary description of the technology they use is as follows: For Pi, we introduced the additional design requirement of employing a consensus algorithm (the process that records transactions into a distributed ledger) that would also be extremely user friendly and ideally enable mining on personal computers and mobile phones. The consensus algorithm that they use is the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) that was architected by David Mazieres a Professor of Computing Science at Stanford University as stated in Pi Network white paper as well.

My recommendation:

Pi has no value currently, just as Bitcoin in 2008, but could have value in the future. Pi Network is using an innovative digital currency technology that will decentralize mining of digital currency to the ordinary people and is user friendly through mobile phones. In my view the risk reward ratio justify my recommendation of jumping in while it is still open. But like for everything in life, feel free to do your own research. This is only my personal opinion and if you decide to go by it I will appreciate you using my code to join. It will bless me in return by accelerating my mining rate."
