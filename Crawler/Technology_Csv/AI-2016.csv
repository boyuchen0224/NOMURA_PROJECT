0,2016-02-25,poseidonoftea,34,Favorite longs? Why?,"Excuse me for the generic posting if you see these on a daily basis, but why not have a little discussion on what your core portfolios look like. I'll start it off.

- AMZN: Dominance in web services and online retail. Growing entertainment services. Growth potential from their R&amp;D for better delivery methods. Web services should continue to grow in importance too.
- GILD: Wanted to capture a little biotech. This is the only one on this list that I'm not well-educated on.
- GOOG: They own the most important platform in consumer computing: the browser. They dominate mobile, and they might come out dominating virtual reality and augmented reality too. They dominate AI research, which is my favorite field of growth in the next 10 years. Their robotics branch makes headlines occasionally, including just in this past week. Their services are ubiquitous, and their leadership is solid.
- LMT: They build the F-35. No division is more important for future combat than aerial attacks. They're heavily contracted for space enterprises. They're working on mobile fusion reactors. They have the famous Skunkworks division for R&amp;D. 
- MU: Great value at $10/share. DRAM is losing profit margin, but 3D NAND is next in line.
- NVDA: My favorite chip manufacturer because of the massive parallelism and its applications to AI, which again is the biggest growth opportunity in tech for the near future, that I see.
- RKDA: Low-priced firm that has tons of IP for agriculture. As water becomes more expensive, as farmland loses fertility, this is the kind of company that will reap the rewards. The IP appears to be consistently high-quality and thus is a major steal. 
- ROK: My best way to capture machine automation. When we talk about machines taking jobs, Rockwell is arguably the world leader for industrial applications. They do some specific AI-related things, but I think they also benefit from other companies pitching into AI growth, as their products will go with ROK's products.
- RTN: Aerial combat is the most powerful and easiest way to kill. Politicians get to keep their noses clean from maintaining presences in countries, and they get to do the dirty work. RTN supplies the missiles that help make this happen. They also make drones, and they do a million other things. All-around, diverse military contractor."

What are some smaller companies you've looked at that could breakout big in the next few years? Companies in robotics, AI, biotech or others that might see big gains or big flops?"
2,2016-02-09,americanpegasus,0,"I called the recent market top and predicted the end of this tech bubble - after giving some of the best performing stocks of the preceding bull run. Now find out what's next, from the master himself.","Everyone knows I am one of the greatest oracles of the modern day.  How I have not been scooped up by some forward-thinking banking think-tank is a cosmic mystery.  
  
Consider I have given /r/investing such stocks as Netflix, Michael Kors, and 3D Systems before any of their monster runs back in 2012.  
  
Then, since early last year I've been warning that we have reached peak market conditions:  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2onv3v/and_then_the_tech_bubble_20_crashed/?  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34axx6/today_a_coworker_struck_up_a_conversation_about/  
  
This subreddit scoffed and continues to scoff at my legendary prowess, but I don't mind.  In fact, last May I told you all that Bitcoin's return over the next 12 months would more than *double* the best performing Vanguard index fund, and **it certainly has**, soaring from $230 to $370.  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34hxdn/the_pegasus_vanguard_vs_bitcoin_challenge_put/?  
  
If that's not enough, I also warned you about the continuing spread of negative interest rates, which are still getting worse by the day:  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3o3dun/three_month_treasury_yields_are_at_zero_percent/?  
  
-------  
  
So, many of you (including top investment professionals at major firms) are probably wondering: ""Pegasus, *wow*!  What's next?""  
  
Well, I'll tell you again, like I always do.  2016 is going to be a crazy year folks; you better buckle up.  
  
**This market isn't going back up until it goes down a lot more!**  
  
I'm calling for a major crash to really punctuate this recent spiral, and I mean something nasty.  I'm expecting a spring time frame, probably in March (yes, as in next month!)  
  
Oil isn't going anywhere.  Expect capitulation to occur as we finally hit $17 a barrel, and possibly lower.  Only then will we go back up, and even then it will take a while to recover.  Bottom line: people trying to catch the falling knife in oil are gonna get burned.  
  
I expect talk of QE4 to begin after the crash though, and it won't be able to come soon enough!  Without QE4 we may see a bottom of 1100 in the S&amp;P by this time next year.  With Q&amp;E?  Well I can't foresee how much magical pretend money the government will print into the stock market, but the reckoning we will face will be the same.     
   
It's simple math: hard assets are going to be precious luxuries soon.  The paper gold market is in for an upheaval as we collectively discover that paper gold is currently a major sham, but the world isn't going back to precious metals... No, the way forward isn't shiny rocks but decentralized digital networks.  
  
This R3 thing the banks are working on?  Because they have so fundamentally misunderstood what a decentralized blockchain is, it will falter and fail.  The banks will use it, of course, in order to try to justify the millions they will spend making it.  But they will eventually abandon it in favor of a true decentralized alternative.  
  
Speaking of which, for a year now I've been intrigued and 'infiltrating' the world of new *private* digital financial networks.  These use protocol level cryptography for financial privacy.  Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero and Aeon are likely to become very big deals in coming years (but I am invested in them, and represent them, so don't take my word for it - check out the cutting edge Cryptonote protocol they are based off of).   
  
The stock market isn't going to implode forever, and I expect a new mega bull run to kick off before 2020, but it's not going to start without some pain first.   
  
Money itself is going to experience it's 'uber moment' and we may even begin to see regulated crypto-securities.  If R3 ever finds a real world niche, it could potentially be here, but I still wouldn't bet on it.  
  
Anyhow, I wouldn't be fucking with anyone at the moment, especially not the 50 - 200 P/E companies that boast 'lots of users'.  You thought LinkedIn's mega crash was news?  More are coming.  
  
You'll know when this tech 2.0 bubble has fully crashed back to Earth because we will be considering the long term viability of even juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon.  And here's where you buy back in.  
  
It's easier said than done now, because when the time comes to buy back in we may truly be in the throes of a major economic crisis.  People will scoff at owning Facebook, Google, or Apple stock but that is where you must go.  
  
The big winners in the next bull run?  The sci-fi tech of tomorrow: virtual reality, self-driving cars, digital money, 3D printing, and AI.  
  
Anyway, I've said enough.  I'm happy to see this crash finally get underway because I know that on the other side of every crash lies opportunity - I just would caution against trying to catch this one on the way down.  You may say to ""buy fear"" but I would argue we haven't even seen fear yet - we're just getting started here.  
  
As always, note that this is all my own opinion and I am not an investment professional.  I am not licensed to give financial advice to anyone, and have no current market positions, long or short.  I only own 100% cryptocurrency at the moment, which I plan to hold for the foreseeable future, and partially diversify from once this market is much lower.  
  
Feel free to disagree with me and be on the wrong side of history yet again.

8,2016-06-15,the_mighty_mango,0,Short Artificial Intelligence,"I am only talking about deep AI. However, things such as driverless cars and predicting the weather are inevitable in the near future. 

Any company that says they're going to make a robot that talks and can interact with human beings. Short. It's all bullshit. Remember the human genome project in the early 2000s? Billions were spent on understanding our genes and we got nothing. Sure you can predict eye color but you can only predict height with a 5% chance, strictly using genes. If I simply look at someone I can predict their children will be of similar height by 80%. Genes don't predict anything useful. That means we are far from understanding ourselves, let alone consciousness. Therefore we can't create anything we don't understand. 

Short any company that says they can. They're spending money on bullshit to make them look appealing. 

Tdlr; minimal AI is going to happen. But an AI with consciousness is going to take centuries to develop."

11,2016-09-19,erichisalurker,103,NVDA DD feel free to critique,"Nvidia’s foundational revenue stream is in its gaming-oriented PC GPU products.  Despite diversification into other market segments, this product division remains the largest revenue-generator for Nvidia. Over the last six quarters, gaming-related products have accounted for more than 50% of sales revenue for the company. However, this relative share of revenue has declined as Nvidia has expanded into other product areas. Since their Q1 2016 report (4-26-2015), revenue streams from Datacenter and Automotive products have increased by 71.6% and 54.55% respectively. Nvidia also generates a significant portion of its revenues from Professional Visualization and OEM &amp; IP products as well. Combined, these segments represent roughly 25% of Nvidia’s revenue. It is worth noting that over the last six quarters the revenue generated from OEM &amp; IP products has declined 25.22% while the revenue from Professional Visualization products has increased by 18.2%


Regionally, Nvidia still derives most of its revenue from the Asia Pacific markets. In Q2 2017 (7-31-2016), revenue in the Asia Pacific region accounted for 66.67% of overall revenue. This is compared to 14.42% from the US, 11.69% from Europe, and 7.21% from Other Americas. There has been stable revenue growth from every region over the last six quarters, keeping in line with the growth in overall revenue. The largest regional growth can be seen in the Asia Pacific and United States regions, indicating improving consumer demand in both of these areas.


Having recognized the declines in relative revenue generation from video game segments, Nvidia has shifted their focus moving forward to larger-scale, more innovative market segments. At Nvidia’s GTC China 2017 presentation, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the massive impact that deep learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have on the world in the coming years. Nvidia seeks to push the boundaries of AI and deep learning technologies, and their first step is with their new GPU architecture, Pascal. Nvidia’s latest line of GPUs for both consumer and commercial use have been hailed as the best performing processors on the market. Furthermore, during the Q2 2017 earnings call, Huang reiterated his belief that deep learning is going to be the company’s most significant growth driver moving forward. Nvidia has very recently procured a contract with Chinese web company Baidu to develop AI platforms for their self-driving cars, adding their name to a client list which already includes industry leaders such as Tesla and BMW. A recent Bank of America forecast suggested that the deep learning and AI market could reach $153 billion by 2020, and Nvidia already has a strong position in the industry. 
	

Nvidia has very strong fundamentals currently. Over the last seven years, Nvidia has reported positive revenue and net income. Both of these metrics have seen substantial growth as costs have been reduced and profit margins have improved. Since 2010 both the total assets and total capital available have nearly doubled to $7370 million and $4580 million respectively. Nvidia has also seen substantial improvements in its ROA, ROC, and ROE. As of FY2016 reporting, ROA is 10.59%, ROC is 17.04%, and ROE is 17.46%. It is estimated that in FY2017, Nvidia will see revenue of $6098 million (12.12% increase from FY2016), net income of $1381.4 million (41.8% increase), and an EPS of $2.30 (67.9% increase). 
	

Nvidia’s TTM P/E ratio is currently sitting at 38.28 compared to an industry average of 15.2 and has a P/BV ratio of 7.51 compared to an industry average of 2.7. Normally these may indicate that the stock is overvalued, however Nvidia is seemingly at the forefront of a huge growth phase in an emerging industry and it appears that the market has priced this future growth in. In the coming months we should see a reduction in the P/E ratio due to higher EPS levels. As of their latest reporting, Nvidia has a current ratio of 2.56. This shows a lot fundamental strength for Nvidia to meet and short-term liabilities. Nvidia’s FY2016 profit margin was 15.58%, and impressive number alongside an equally impressive ROE of 17.46%. 
	

Given current fundamentals, Nvidia will be able to see a growth rate of 11.1%. This number is based on an equally-weighted average between the company’s Long-Run Growth Rate (10.90%) as shown on the company’s Bloomberg Terminal page and the Sustainable Growth Rate (11.28%) derived from the following formula: (ROE*b)/[1-(ROE*b)] where ROE is the company’s return on equity for the previous fiscal year and b is the retention ratio for the company. Nvidia’s current WACC is 12.5%, which is used as a benchmark for required return. Based on these two values and Nvidia’s returns over the last six years, Nvidia has an implied value of $46,827.67 million when using an earnings power valuation model. With 535 million shares outstanding, this implies a stock price of $87.52 per share. At the closing price of $62.84 on Sept. 16, there is a margin of safety of 28%. 
	

In spite of the huge returns Nvidia has already seen this year, I believe that it still has huge upside potential and would be a fantastic long-term buy. Nvidia’s upcoming product lines and revenue streams have positioned them positioned the company to be at the forefront of a growing deep learning and AI industry. Automation and self-learning software are becoming a larger part of our lives every day and Nvidia is creating the tools necessary to meet these new computational demands."

Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said this April that ""we are moving from a mobile-first world to a AI-first one"".

Google is pivoting from web search to AI assisting. Great, except for the fact that their main source of revenue are web ads. How will this fit with their new strategy? I don't see how they can monetize Google assistant. Selling hardware? They won't sell as much as Apple or Samsung, and I don't know if hardware manufacturing scales as well as software development. Licensing their AI technology? Android is actually not particularly profitable for Alphabet, actually (tons of users but little revenue per user).

If Google assistant gets massive usage Alphabet will figure out how earn money with it sooner or later, but would it be that profitable as web ads?"

17,2016-11-21,ILoveSushi1337,3,My growth stock portfolio for 2017. Predicting a 50%+ gain overall. My reasoning included.,"My growth stock portfolio will be $60K, expecting a return of 50%+, so will be expecting to be at least $90K by end of next year. 

Here are my picks:
$GM
$AUPH
$RSXJ
$RSX
$AMD (will add January 2017 after Fed rate hike)
$NVDA (will add January 2017 after Fed rate hike)
$TSLA (a big maybe, will add January 2017 if it dips to around $150; if not then I will not buy)
$MTL

Reasoning:
$GM - Trump loves $GM despite what he said about his concerns regarding overseas manufacturing. $GM has better financials compared to $F and $TSLA and with new electric car lineup like the 2017 Chevy Bolt Electric, I think $GM is due for a bull run soon (which has already started). 

$AUPH - Voclosporin will most likely be approved in 2017, and this stock has a 117%+ upside potential according to the median analyst's estimates if this indeed does go through as planned. There is no reason for this not to happen unless voclosporin causes patient deaths, which the last study did not attribute to. 

$RSXJ and $RSX- With Trump's presidency, sanctions against Russia will gradually be loosened. I don't expect a dramatic loosening of sanctions as the GOP will be cautious. However, I do predict a much better relationship between the US and Russia with Trump in power as opposed to Obama/Hillary. $RSXJ has more growth stock holdings like $AFLT and $MTL, whereas $RSX has more blue chips like $OGZPY, which should improve more dramatically as oil prices rise after the OPEC meeting. 

$AMD - This is a bit of a gamble but I do think that a favorable product line-up in 2017 will boost AMD's market share in both CPUs and CPUs. AMD is mainly concentrating in capturing more market share from Intel and Nvidia at this stage, rather than investing in new growth engines. 

$NVDA - This will probably undergo some corrections by the time the Fed raises rates. I'm expecting a 5% pullback and this will be a good entry point. NVDA just has too much momentum going for it, with AI and driverless cars. 

$TSLA - Tesla has a chance to be a real growth stock if Trump takes a lighter stance on the company's inclination to green energy (solar power). Very much a dark horse ATM, but seeing how advanced its driverless car technology is, I really don't see it falling below $150 unless Trump's policies ruins the industry. 

$MTL - A Russian ADR which will see continuous explosive growth through 2017 if the Russian economy does grow as forecast. Expect more infrastructure as Russia gets back on track to improving the economy rather than fighting in Crimea and the Middle East.

20,2016-11-05,AnythingForSuccess,82,Are we naive to expect historical returns from indexing?,"What indicators in the future do you see that could continue the huge 7% annual growth rate of the world economy?

So far as I see it there is population growth, which means more consumers. And there is globalisation, which means brands establishing themselves world wide.

In a bit further future I see Google coming out with AI helper of some sort that will be a very demanded product, but it should be priced in the market right now anyway and even if they do come out with something like that it will probably just replace the smartphone or come along with a smartphone app like an extremely intelligent Google Assistant.

What else? Well, we can have Mars colonisation. That might grow economy...a little bit, but not by huge margin.

Then again, if we don't index and if market is efficient, then what other choices do we have? Picking stocks is a fools game and market is more efficient than it was in 1950-2000 due to information availability.

Let us say in a bad scenario, over 20-30 years of indexing we only get about 3% annual growth rate with dividends reinvested. Pretty bad right? But what else can we do to ""make it""?

Hi Friends,

I’m writing this letter to you because I’ve identified you as someone who is or may be interested in learning more about long-term investing. I have too many friends who have decided that investing is too complex for them, and they either write off investing altogether or pay a mutual fund company thousands of dollars in fees over their lifetime. I have spent the past several years reading everything I can and teaching myself how to be a successful investor. I’m still very much an idiot, but I realize that my knowledge today can help you make better investment decisions for your future. 

*Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago*. – Warren Buffett

I’d like to start with an introduction about my investing style.

***Dividend Value Investing***

*Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.* – Warren Buffett

My investing style closely resembles the value investing style espoused by Warren Buffett mixed with a heavy emphasis on dividends. Value investing is characterized by buying high quality, dividend paying companies at reasonable prices.  

How do I ensure a company is high-quality? A high-quality company will have a wide moat, meaning other companies will have a tough time gaining market share from the wide-moat company. An example of a company with a wide moat is Union Pacific Railroad. It is tough if not impossible for a company to come in, buy land, gain permits, purchase cars, and start laying tracks.

 I favor boring companies who sell products people will continue to buy 25+ years in the future. People will still need toothpaste, band-aids, and water 30 years from now. 

 I like companies that generate lots of cash each quarter. High quality companies exhibit stable, 10+ year trends of increasing earnings per share (EPS).  These companies should have management which uses this cash to make strategic acquisitions or returns this capital to shareholders via dividends (preferably both). 

Specific metrics I use to make sure a company is high-quality:

* **Dividend Yield &gt; 2%** – This is how much the money you invest in a company will earn via dividends throughout the year. I like companies with a greater dividend yield than the general market. The sweet spot for dividend yield range tends to be 2.4-5%. Dividends are passive income currently taxed at a 15% rate.
* **Payout Ratio &lt;70%** - Tells how much of a company’s earnings are currently being paid out via dividends. I want to ensure a company can continue to increase their dividend without eroding earnings.
*** Return on Equity  (5 year median) &gt; 10%** - This formula tells how much net income is returned as a percentage of shareholders equity.  This formula is used to measure management’s effectiveness of using shareholder’s capital to generate earnings. High return on equity = high quality management.
* **Earnings Per Share (10 year growth) &gt; 10** -  This shows on average how much a company increases its growth rate by over 10 years. I like to see companies who have weathered 10 years of the economic cycle, and still have managed to grow earnings by 10% on average. 
* **Debt to equity ratio &lt;.55** – Debt to equity ratio is a measure financial leverage. It calculates a company’s total liabilities and divides it by shareholder’s equity. The lower the number the better as it means a company isn’t using debt to finance its assets. A low debt level ensures a company can withstand an economic downturn.

***Margin of Safety***

*Rule #1: Don’t lose money. Rule #2: Don’t forget rule #1* – Warren Buffett

Warren Buffett talks about ensuring your investments have “a high margin of safety”. Margin of safety is ensured by making sure the companies you are buying are undervalued, and able to withstand deteriorating market conditions. 
 
An undervalued company is not likely to go down as much during a recession as a highly valued, growth company. Investors get greedy during bull markets. Stocks like Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla get bid up on the expectation that money will keep flowing, and growth will continue forever in the double digits. In a recession, these high growth stocks drop the fastest and hardest. You instead want companies whose value metrics are relatively lower than the general market, as these companies offer safety in case the 7 year bull run goes the other way. 

Specific metrics I look at to check if a company is undervalued are:
 
* **PE (Price to Earnings Ratio) &lt; market’s average** – Price to earnings measures the price of the stock divided by the earnings per share. This is a basic way to see how a stock is being valued compared to its past. I look at the forward PE because it takes the current price divided by the future year’s earnings estimates. This ratio provides a way to see what a company’s PE will look like if they meet their earnings estimates. 
* **PE&lt; 10 year median PE** – A good way to check how PE compares to historical PE for the company
* **PS (Price to Sales Ratio) &lt; 10 year PS** – Measures current price of stock to current sales. This compares to the historical PS average. 
* **PB (Price to Book Ratio) &lt; 10 year PB** – Measures the price of the stock divided by the book value of the company. This compares to the historical PB ratio.
* **PE &lt; Industry Avg PE** – We want the PE of the stock to ideally be lower than its industry’s PE. Certain industries will usually have a higher PE. Technology companies will usually have higher PE than a paper company.
* **EPS 10 year chart** A favorite method of mine to see if a company is undervalued is comparing the 10 year chart of a company’s stock price, with the 10 year earnings per share (EPS) overlayed. When the EPS is rising , and the share price is down, it’s a good indicator that shares are undervalued. This method was popularized in the book, Purple Chips.

***Dividend Growth***

*Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it…he who doesn’t pays it* –Albert Einstein

When I buy stock in a company, I plan on holding it long term, ideally 20+ years. It’s important to me that a business/company can do well in recessions and bull markets. Slow and steady growth is the name of the game. Dividend growth is extremely important to me. Dividends have accounted for 30% of stock returns over the past 80 years. When management raises the dividend, it is the ultimate signal that management is confident earnings will continue to grow. Dividends cannot be fudged on accounting statements. The money is paid directly to you quarterly, and will be taxed at a 15% rate. 

If I buy a company currently yielding 5%, and it raises their dividend 10% every year, after 10 years I will be earning a 10% yield on my original investment, and this doesn’t include any stock price appreciation. Earning 10% on your money is unbeatable, even in a high-interest environment. My goal is to generate $80,000 in passive income via dividends to draw upon for retirement by 2036. 

***Market Timing &amp; Greed***

*Time in the market beats timing the market.*

*Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful* – Warren Buffett

The biggest mistake people make with investing is letting their emotions of fear and greed interferes with sticking to a sound investment philosophy. Wall Street makes billions each year off naïve investors buying at the top, and then selling when things look like there is no hope.
  
The fact is the stock market is wildly unpredictable. Like a manic-depressive person, no one truly ever knows whether the market will go up or down. By investing in solid companies that pay dividends, you will make money no matter which way the market decides to go. It helps if your retirement date is 10+ years out. Time is on your side. You can withstand paper losses that recessions will bring. Don’t sell and keep reinvesting your dividends and extra capital. Slow and steady will win the race, and you will be rewarded for your patience and steady emotions.

*Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a fly epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497*- Warren Buffett

***Companies I am Buying or Adding to My Positon:***

In order of largest to smallest holding percentage:

* 1. **Johnson &amp; Johnson - JNJ**

My largest holding. JNJ is a diversified healthcare company. You probably know them for their consumer health business where they make band-aids, baby shampoo, and Tylenol. Their other 2 businesses include medical devices and their fastest growing-pharmaceuticals. JNJ has raised their dividend for 54 straight years. Their management is top-notch, and they are approaching a reasonable PE ratio of around 19. 

*  2.**Lockheed Martin – LMT**

Lockheed Martin is an aerospace and defense company who sells stealth jets, missile and radar systems, and space flight vehicles. Their customers are primarily the US government and its NATO allies. Lockheed’s price has increased recently with Trump and Republicans winning. People expect the US military to increase spending over the next 4 years. Lockheed pays a nice dividend of 2.8%. Management has grown profits very well over the past 10 years. Do I feel scummy investing in the military industrial complex? Sometimes. I also think there are a lot of bad people out there, and we need advanced weaponry to provide a deterrent against them. I expect Lockheed to do extremely well as governments continue to upgrade against global terrorism. 

* 3.**Royal Dutch Shell – RDS.B**

Royal Dutch Shell is an energy company selling oil, natural gas, and renewables. Like most energy companies, their prices has dropped significantly since the price of oil dropped from $100 to its current $50 a barrel. Shell has been moving away from oil, and recently spent $50 billion to acquire BG Group, the largest natural gas supplier. Shell’s dividend is currently 7%, and they are committed to paying it throughout this oil downturn. Oil may not reach $100 a barrel, but OPEC will not let oil continue to decline as it has over the past year. Since I wrote this, OPEC announced production cuts so that oil-dependent countries like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia can stop losing billions of dollars each year. Shell is paying you 7% to wait out this oil decline. The world will continue to need more energy, which is why I am adding to my holding. 

* 4.**Welltower – HCN**

Welltower is a healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that buys and manages senior housing, post acute care, and assisted living centers. REIT’s are required to pay out 90% of its profits in dividends, which is why Welltower is currently yielding 5.5%. Baby boomers are just at the beginning of retiring en masse. Anyone with an older relative realizes how important and necessary senior living centers are. Welltower has been paying dividends for 30+ years. I like Welltower as a stable income producing company who will experience growth for the next 10-20 years as people continue to get old, live longer, and utilize senior housing.

* 5.**Cisco – CSCO**

Cisco designs, manufactures, and sells Internet based networking products and services. Their bread and butter are data center and enterprise switches, routers, conferencing systems, and their fast-growing cyber security businesses. They are the market leader in helping computers talk with one another. Cisco current trades at a 12 forward PE, which is significantly lower than the general market’s PE of 20. Their PE and price to sales numbers are currently lower than their 5 and 10 year medians. Cisco has a great CEO in John Chambers. They have an operating margin of 25% and current free cash flow of 12b. Their dividend is a solid 3.5%. This is a great tech company to buy and hold.

* 6.**International Business Machines – IBM**

IBM is considered a dinosaur in the tech world, and some people foolishly write them off because of this. IBM is in the middle of a multi-year transformation away from traditional businesses like software and IT outsourcing to their “strategic imperative” businesses of big data &amp; analytics, cloud mobile, and social/security. More recently, IBM has developed the AI technology, Watson. You may have seen Watson win the show Jeopardy a few years back. IBM has a low PE, huge cash reserves, and excellent returns on assets/equity. IBM has transformed itself multiple times in its 100+ year history. I will collect their 3.5% dividend yield as they do it again.

* 7.**Abbvie Pharmaceuticals – ABBV**

Abbvie is a research based company focusing on treating conditions such as Parkinson’s, HIV, cancer, dermatology, cystic fibrosis, and other conditions. Abbvie was spun off from the blue chip, Abbot Labs, in 2012. Abbvie’s stock price has remained stagnant over the past year as concerns about its top selling drug, Humira’s, patents due to expire. Humira makes up 60% of Abbvie’s sales. Abbvie has lawyers upon lawyers to postpone the expiration of its patent. I believe there is too much pessimism about Abbvie’s future earnings dropping. They trade at a forward PE of 12 compare to the industry average of 22. They have a return on equity and assets of 118% and 10% respectively. Management raised the dividend last month signaling they expect Abbvie’s earnings to continue to grow. They have a 5 year dividend growth rate of over 40%. Abbvie is a rare chance own a great pharma company while collecting a 4.3% dividend yield.

* 8.**Union Pacific Railways – UNP**

Who wants to own a railroad in 2016? Union Pacific runs several railways in the Western United States. These railways primarily ship coal, chemicals, and industrial products (do you know a President elect who like coal and building steel walls?). They have a duopoly with Burlington Santa Fe allowing them to command a 37% operating margin. They have grown their income 16% yearly over the past 10 years. Their dividend is currently 2.3%, but they have grown that dividend 16% over the past 5 years.  Union Pacific has an extremely wide moat. I used to think of railways as inefficient and non-environmentally friendly. Did you know railways can move freight 436 miles on one gallon of fuel. Try doing that in a semi or 747. 

* 9.**John Deere and Co – DE**

John Deere is known for their big green tractors, but they also sell dump trucks, loaders, excavators, and anything else to help farmers get better yields. We are currently in the middle of a 5 year lull in corn prices. When corn prices pick up, this gives farmers more money to upgrade their equipment. Deere is an extremely cyclical company, and their price has increased much in the past year as people expect corn prices to rebound. I’d wait for a pullback to initiate a position in them. Still they have an excellent brand, with a long history of rewarding shareholders. They currently yield 2.6% and are increasing their dividend 11% on a yearly average over the past 5 years.

* 10.**Novo Nordisk – NVO**

Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company whose two main businesses are diabetes and obesity care. I hope to never have to utilize their drugs and services, but I also understand I’m in the minority. Most people in the US and world are getting fatter. We rely on cars for transportation, sit at desks 8+ hours a day, and are too lazy to exercise. Even worse we have super cheap junk food at our fingertips 24/7. This trend is only continuing as billions of people in China and India enter the “modern world”. Sounds bleak, but don’t worry, Novo Nordisk is there to get you your insulin and diabetes devices. They are also involved with hormone replacement therapy products. Novo has sold off 40% this year over concerns of drug pricing pressure in the United States. They are at a 52 week low. They generate tons of money, yield 2.6%, and are trading at historic lows. 

* 11.**Cummins– CMI**

Cummins designs, manufactures, and distributes diesel and natural gas engines. They have a free cash flow of 1.5b, a forward PE of 14, and have grown earnings by 10% each year over the past 5 years. They currently yield 3%, with a long history of paying/increasing dividends. They have a strong brand in a great niche market. 


* 12.**Schweitzer-Mauduit International – SWM**

This is a new holding for me. SWM is a paper and plastics company. 60% of their business is in producing cigarette papers. Governments around the world mandate cigarette companies use their Lower Ignition Prospensity (LIP) papers. These papers ensure cigarettes do not light on fire when dropped to the ground. This business is slowing as cigarette consumption drops around the world. In 2012, new management came in and changed their strategy to diversify their business away from cigarette papers. They now make water filtration systems, tea bags, and other specialty products. The transformation is working as net income has grown 18% each year over the past 5 years. They have a return on equity /assets of 17 and 8%. Operating margin of 15%, and a forward PE of 12. Their debt to equity ratio is a little high at .51, but management is committed to paying down debt from their recent acquisitions. Even better their dividend yields 4%, and has grown 11% per year over the past 5 years. An upcoming catalyst for them could be selling papers to the marijuana industry. More states and countries countinue to legalize marijuana. These sales can help offset the decline of their cigarette business.  


* 13.**TD Bank – TD**

TD Bank is headquartered in Toronto, Canada. They have a great steady business with management that pays a dividend yield of 3.5%. Canadian banks are more steady growers than their riskier US counterparts. TD Bank has room to continue growing their earnings and dividend.

* 14.**Visa – V**

Visa is an anomaly in my portfolio. They trade at a high PE (29) and pay a paltry dividend (.86%). Visa is a growth stock. Visa runs the world’s largest payment network. They do not assume any of the responsibilities with fraud or credit card debt. They just collect their 2.5% on every transaction made when someone uses a card with Visa on it. The world will continue to use less cash as e-commerce grows. Visa has rarely traded at a reasonable PE ratio. This is mostly due to their incredible business. They have an operating margin of 65% with no signs on this slowing down.

* 15.**T Rowe Price – TROW**

T Rowe Price provides financial advice and mutual funds. They have grown their dividend 27 years in a row, and currently yield 2.9%. They are currently trading at a forward PE of 16 compared to their 10 year median of 24. Their business and management is truly a blue-chip. They have a return on equity/assets of 24 and 18%, showing that they can invest in themselves and make money. 

* 16.**Boeing – BA**

Boeing’s businesses are airplanes and defense. They are trading at a forward PE of 20.55 compared to a 10 year median of 28. They have 8.4b in free cash flow. Their dividend yield 3%. Their net income and dividends continue to grow. This a blue chip with a wide moat, and 42 years of dividend increases.

* 17.**Tesoro– TSO**

Tesoro refines petroleum and bio-fuel products. They also have a great gas station retail business. More and more Americans continue to drive, especially in the Western States where Tesoro operates. They have made strategic acquisitions that will allow them to continue paying a decent dividend (2.5%) and increasing their income. 

 
* 18.**Walmart – WMT**

Walmart is like IBM in that they are in the middle of a huge transformation, and they have a very, very long history of making successful transitions They were a little late to e-commerce, but concerns about Amazon taking them over were overdone. They have a huge transportation and logistics advantage over every retailer in the world. Their low price model has proven successful in China, Mexico, and India. They have made huge investments in e-commerce to compete with Amazon in the United States. At a PE of 15, and dividend growth for 41+ years, Walmart is still a bargain.

* 19.**Western Digital – WDC**

Western digital sells storage hard drives and solid state drives. Their business will continue to grow as more storage is needed for all of the pictures, videos, and data we continue to share. Their forward PE is 9, dividend yield of 3.4%. This is a great tech company that will reap the benefits from their aqusition of Sandisk.

* 20.**Nike – NKE**

Nike has been my worst performer over the past year (down 16%). Their PE has gone from 30 to 22, highlighting why it’s never good to pay a premium, especially in retail. I still think Nike has a bright future, and this is as good a time as any to buy part of the company. Their dividend was increased so that they yield 1.5%. If you have traveled overseas, you know how popular the brand is abroad. They still dominate in shoe sales. They own the brands converse, who’s Chuck Taylors remain popular. Athletic wear is a fast growing market. They recently announced their $700 self-lacing shoe called the HyperAdapt which has been sold out everywhere, and are currently being sold for $5000+ on ebay. I don’t like retail stocks, but Nike and VFC are the only companies in the space I would consider owning.


There you have it friends. I’d like to continue writing a letter like this once a year. My wife and I are having our first child next year, so I’m not entirely sure how much time or money we will have to invest. Still, please let me know if you would like to continue receiving these letters. I would love to hear your thoughts. A link to my investment workbook is below. Keep investing for the future. Once you build that nest egg, have a plan to use that money and free time to better others’ lives.
