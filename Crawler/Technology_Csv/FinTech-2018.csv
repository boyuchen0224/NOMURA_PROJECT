I believe this is truly a stock with Netflix/Amazon level returns. These contracts prove their system and will only lead to more.

It dipped with the market last week and is now at a great buying level and I anticipate it to make huge upward moves. On top of that, all these announcements have came in the last 2 months pretty steadily and I am expecting to see even a few more before the next ER."
1,2018-02-05,Bongstradamus,16,"Capital One Investing fallout: Which brokerage to move to? Folio/Fidelity/Ameritrade, Stockpile or stay through migration to E-Trade?","With the recent news that Capital One Investing will be sold and migrated to E-Trade, I've been looking at what my options are.  E-Trade has said they dont plan to offer the same kind of dollar based investing services that Cap One Investing currently offers which makes me want to consider moving before the migration.  I have an IRA, a custodial account and a personal account at Cap One.

Folio offers dollar based investing, but they also charge either $15 a quarter ($60/year) for a low trading activity account or $290 a year for one of their unlimited accounts.  I'm not a big trader, so I'd probably be a Basic plan candidate, which means I'd pay $10 for trades and another $60 a year.  I really hate the idea of being charged a service fee for investing with a brokerage, but I do like that they have dollar based investing and other services to manage multiple accounts.  Just out of principal I'm willing to walk away from considering Folio solely because of the fee.

Fidelity seems to be about the most attractive choice given that they dont charge an account fee and they offer all different types of accounts and a banking option as well.  They dont have dollar based investing, and while thats not a dealbreaker its still a feature I really like as a way to build up positions in higher priced stocks.  So far I'm leaning towards Fidelity just because of the overall offering, their credibility and the reviews of other users who seem to swear by them.

I have a couple accounts with Ameritrade already and I like them, but they also dont offer a dollar based investing service.  Their fees are a little higher, and frankly I'm a little perturbed that they changed their list of commission free etfs recently.  All said and done, they provide a good service it just doesnt have the lower fees, the accounts dont earn very good interest on uninvested cash, they dont offer dollar based investing, and I think that Fidelity beats them out in an apples to apples comparison.

Then there's Stockpile, a dollar based investing platform which might be the perfect place for my individual portfolio.  They offer DRIP and a $4 trade fee.  This is essentially the same pricing as Cap Ones automatic investment plan.  However, I'm skeptical of newer businesses, especially in the fintech space and I dont know if I trust this company enough to move my personal portfolio over to them, but they do offer nearly the exact same service I've come to love with Cap One.

So thats the dilemma I'm going through at the moment.  I have time to consider my options before making any kind of migration, but I know for sure I'm not feeling comfortable with being forced to be a part of E-Trade.  Are any of you guys considering the same kind of move and if so, what have you narrowed down your choices to and why?  Are there other brokerages with no account fees and low cost trades that offer dollar based investing like Cap One?  I'd love to hear what you guys are thinking about and your recommendations."

5,2018-05-22,simonsarris,19,The eCommerce/fintech/small-biz-tech space generally is really heating up this year. $SQ $SHOP $PYPL,"Good morning!

Small timeline:

* Verifone (PAY) was acquired in early April.

* Square (SQ) acquires Weebly in late April (to round out itself in eCommerce, which was its weakness vs Shopify)

* PayPal acquires iZettle in May (to compete with SQ where they failed in the past with its homegrown product). iZettle was about to IPO with a 1.1bn valuation, PYPL pays 2.2bn for it. If this is overpaying, it signals a validation of SQ's business model, and that PYPL is giving up on their homegrown stuff (called PayPal Here).

* Square just yesterday issues $750 in convertible notes (I have a lot of speculation on this one, but something big is brewing)

* Adobe acquired Magento today (SHOP stock way down on the news)

Earlier, when Amazon mulled p2p payments (Square has Cash App, PYPL has Venmo), both stocks dip on the announcement, which was otherwise pretty hollow PR. Amazon actually had a Square/iZettle competitor called Amazon Register that they shut down back in 2015, so I would not be surprised if they want to get back into transaction spaces. Also wouldn't be surprised if they made a bid for SHOP or SQ within 2 years in order to get into eCommerce and small biz tech generally.

Both SQ and SHOP and PYPL have had nice years, stock price wise. But on the 52week SQ is up most of alll: 

**$SQ**: +169.2%

**$PYPL**: +63.3% 

**$SHOP**: +61.3% (this was higher until very recently)

**$PAY**: 28.7% - Even though its getting acquired, investors have barely made any money in the last year compared to the other three!

Disclosure: I'm watching this space very closely and am long SQ, AMZN.

18,2018-08-15,Friendmann,2,Bullmarket? Lets take a look at European Banks!,"Hello everyone!

I've looked this monday into the European banks. At this day the European banks lost quitte a bit of value due to the drop of the Turkish lira. Before this drop the banks didn't perform well either. In the next document you can find a small investigation about the European banks. I've mainly looked towards the high dividend yields and the market. 

My English is not my native language and I am not a great writer too. I am sorry if there are many mistakes. 

While doing this research I had a bit of trouble making the investigation complete. The banking sector is a pretty huge one with lots of rules, risks and politics. The investigation is not really complete due to limited time and resources. I maybe am going to finish it further. But I feel now is a good moment to discuss European Banks. 

Click [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krmxBqJYxDhcapsVOpjSev9d6oIiwYwQ/view?usp=sharing) for my document about European banks

Click [**here**](https://www.stoxx.com/index-details?symbol=SX7GT) for the Stoxx Banks Indices

What I want to know from you guys are the next points.

* What do you think about the (European) banking sector right now?
* Are the European banks valued attractively right now?
* Should the European Banking sector be avoided because of high risks?
* Do you think banks can compete against technologic disruptive forces?
* Do you know more about the southern banks like BBVA and SAN? (Their stock prices are even below the stock prices of 2009)
* … 

I haven't added a conclusion in my research yet because I feel it is not complete.

My opinion about European banks is positive for the long term.  I believe the low stock prices of the banks are a good way to hedge you're portfolio against the high valued tech companies. The banking sector will not become a fast growing sector so you shouldn't expect fast money for it. Banks shall stay around for a long long time though. They invest in fintech to protect them from a disruptive future. They have more money than fintech companies alone. which makes them able to stay smart. Cryptocurrencies aren't forming a real threat with the new instant payment systems. Furthermore banks have more money and knowledge to compete against the cryptocurrency.

Tech companies like Facebook Amazon and Google can add banking activities. This would be a huge disruptive factor in the sector. But it is a pretty huge expensive and unlogic step for these companies. The bankingsector is hard to join because of the many rules banks are given. These companies need to create a lot of risks for the licenses and capital reserves etc joining a high competitive world with many huge players already in. If they succeed they become massive datamachines. knowing everything about a person. These companies are already sensitive with their privacypolicies, which will increase after adding banking information. 

Banks do have high risks. Bad economic events can bring the banks stock prices down further. The banks have a high dividend yield so you still have some dividend for compensation. Looking at the Stoxx banking index you see European Banks is already down more than 20% from it's high this year.

The European banks only increased 66% after the big drop in 2009. This is a high difference with the Europe 50 index which grew up to more than 160% after 2009.

So what do you think about European Banks?"
19,2018-09-19,dillonrpayt,5,$XYF,"This has been a crazy year for Chinese stocks. A lot of IPO’s and rocket ships. However, X Financial really stands out in my mind. X Financial is a peer to peer lending platform where investors can lend to non-credited borrowers. It’s risky for the investor since the borrower is non-credited, but, for the platform it’s been a highly profitable venture with over $445 Million in profits within 12 months of the IPO.

Even though $XYF has shot up shortly after IPOing, here are some reasons why I believe it’s still a buy:

* The firm operates a third-party marketplace of financing and wealth management services for the Chinese market.
* 84.2% of the loans that XYF facilitates were largely funded through investments that individual investors make via its Wealth Management online portal. The remaining loans were funded via corporate or institutional investors.
* China has overtaken the United States as the global leader in FinTech venture capital activities (in 2016) and represents 47 percent of global FinTech investments
* Sharply increased operating profit, Increasing operating margin, Fluctuating cash flow from or used in operations
* Wishes to be the top personal finance leader in China. 
*Is profitable

There are some downsides and risk to this like with all Chinese stocks. Chinese companies have been known to have “sketchy accounting practices.” Here are some of the downsides:

*XYF has seen its top line revenue growth rate drop significantly, likely due to regulatory impacts on its business from a Chinese government crackdown on online consumer lending.
*Peer to peer lending platforms are susceptible to lawsuits due to its high risk nature. 

With Chinese stocks being red hot on US Markets, i believe this is one of the few Chinese companies that has something to show for instead of being just a “vision.” Which is very popular now days

&gt; Installment plans have helped shoppers afford large purchases since the late 19th century and are still available for pricey items like cars and smartphones. But to delay payment for a T-shirt and a couple pairs of jeans, you needed a credit card. Now several fintech startups are putting smaller purchases on installment, too. 
Max Levchin
Source: Affirm

&gt; Earlier this year, Australia’s Afterpay began offering installment plans in the U.S., joining Affirm, a San Francisco startup launched by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin. Square announced its own installments plan in October; so did Swedish payments company Klarna, which has teamed up with H&amp;M to offer services in 14 markets it didn’t name.

&gt; Consumers apply online or via app and learn whether they’ve been approved in seconds. They click a button at checkout on the websites of participating retailers if they want to pay by installment. Cotton On, which sells inexpensive apparel, began offering U.S. installments through Afterpay in August. E-commerce chief Brendan Sweeney says 20 percent of buyers are already using the feature, which breaks up bills into four equal parts spread over six weeks and charges no interest.

&gt; Afterpay Touch Group Ltd. caught on quickly with Australian millennials, many of whom abandoned credit cards after the 2008 recession. Founder Nick Molnar was a teenager when the crisis hit and understood intuitively that his contemporaries would approach credit differently from their forebears.

&gt; The company charges no interest, instead collecting a fee of as much as 6 percent of a sale from the retailer. Afterpay works with 20,000 merchants globally—including 1,000 now online in the U.S. where the company has signed up Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie and Free People.

&gt; Afterpay is betting American millennials will be just as keen on its service as their Australian counterparts. The company says 65 percent of the U.S. cohort don’t have a credit card, are 30 on average and are intrigued by using installments to pay for merchandise. Leslie Parrish, a senior analyst at researcher Aite Group, says the simplicity of installments is at the heart of the appeal. “You know precisely when you’ll pay off that loan,” she says. “That gives you more discipline.”"

The recent moves into the fintech industry and increasing positions in AAPL have me wondering what this quarter will look like.

We all know Buffett likes investing in value so with the recent volatility, where do you guys think they put their money? My money's on $BK, $LUV, $TEVA. "
26,2018-11-09,Crizzzuu,1,"Are all cryptocurrencies scams and useles? Is blockchain just a buzzword to atract dumb investors to throw money at the ones raising funds? well, Yes and No.","At this point, most of you must've heard something about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Good and bad, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

* *The insane ROI on coins going + 36 000% in a year with hundreds of millions in USD transacted daily*
* *The amounts of innocent people getting scammed who didn't know any better*
* *The people taking out loans and second mortages on their houses, just to lose it all in gambling on crypto currencies*
* *The illegal washtrading and blatant market manipulations going on*
* *The benefits of using the open, auditable immutable distriburtued ledger technologies that blockchain has to offer*
* *This one you must've heard, ""only criminals, scammers and terrorists use cryptocurrencies""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to summarise, you have heard alot of bad things about it, but the is alot of good aswell. Most of what you have heard is true, there is alot of criminal activity, tax evasion, scams, market manipulation etc. going on, im not going to lie about it. But that is not at all what blockchain and crypto is about. There are several bad actors going around and tarnishing the whole space. Blockchain and crypto is a legit movement which aims to better and improve existing industries such as:

* *FinTech.*
*  *IoT.*
* *supplychain management.*
* *preventing fraud and high markups by middlemen,*
*  *providing actual sound money for people in developing countries where there is always a fear of hyper inflation of the local currency due to highly uncapable leaders. (look at venezuela, argentina, turkey, zimbabwe etc.)* 
* *providing verifyable identities to people without identities, can you imagine living without being to verify who you are?*
* *financial inclusion, providing banking services to people with no access to them*
* *tracking and verifying authenticity of a product / good / collectible*

These are just a set of examples what blockchain and crypto can and probably will improve on. Now, dont get me wrong. Currently many, if not most cryptocurrencies are actual scams and money grabs from innocent people tryng to get those incredible gains of 100x ROI, chasing pumps and losing their money.

The key when looking up and investing in cryptocurrencies is extensive research and analyzing of a company and its staff, being patient and not to ""FOMO"" (Fear Of Missing OUT) and finding these companies providing a solution to a problem or an actual upgrade to what the legacy system has to offer. Don't go throwing your money at something someone else recommended to you. Do your own research, it has to be extensive and thorough, otherwise you might just go to a roulet table, put it all on red and wish for the best. Most of the  companies runnig a crypto / blockchain don't even need it. They have no use of it and only try to ride the hype which the ""blockchain buzzword"" offers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just as an example, im going to provide you info on a Canadian company called Adbank and im hoping to give you a different perspective on the crypto and blockchain industry. If you change your mind (assuming all you think about when you hear crypto is ""ponzi, scam and criminal activity"") and start allocating a samll % of your portfolio into crypto, I hope you keep in mind that it is very risky at all times and do some serious contemplating if it's actually a good idea to put some money into what ever it is you are thinking of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about adbank, i'm going to provide you with some background on the online ad-industry, which Adbank is providing its services to. 

The online ad-industry is a place where ad-fraud is running rampant. The internet is riddled with bot traffic (any wehre form 40-60% of internet traffic is bots), advertisers lose 1/3 of their moeny to bots watching their ads and it's actually the second largest source of income for criminal organizations, second to none but illegal drugs. Can you imagine that?

There is a russian group of hackers, who make 3 000 000 USD on a daily basis due to them runnig a few bots. [Adweek actually released an article about this group, which you can read here.](https://www.adweek.com/digital/russian-ring-digital-ad-crooks-reportedly-making-over-3-million-day-175194/)

There is little or close to none transparency in the industry, which industry giants such as google and facebook have been sued several times for. Both advertisers and publishers are pretty helpes in these cases and there was no improvement in sight until blockchain. here are a few articles for youto read if you want to verify:

[https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/06/google-and-facebook-sued-over-failure-to-disclose-political-ad-spending/](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/06/google-and-facebook-sued-over-failure-to-disclose-political-ad-spending/)

[https://hackernoon.com/why-adtrader-is-suing-google-and-why-most-advertisers-might-never-get-that-chance-again-2bc3ee376d0c](https://hackernoon.com/why-adtrader-is-suing-google-and-why-most-advertisers-might-never-get-that-chance-again-2bc3ee376d0c)

&amp;#x200B;

The industry also has a problem with payment times, sometimes ranging between a week or two to motnhs.

Now that we have established some sort of understanding what problems the industry has, lets open up how blockchain can provide solutions to them. I'm not going to go into detail on how blockchain and smart contracts work, due to me not being tech savvy enough and it would probably double the length of this already long post. But i will shortly and very simply tel you what can be achieved.

Through blockchain technology all the transactions become transparent and auditable. What this means basically is that every advertiser can verify that their money is going to the right place and no where else. This kind of transparency has never been seen in this space. heres a quote from the SVP of customer experience at adweek when talking about piloting Adbanks tech:

 

&gt;*“We are excited to be experiencing the way blockchain is providing a new level of accountability and transparency in ad technology. Adbank is delivering on a concept that appeals to the entire marketing ecosystem — and we look forward to seeing how the industry will evolve when it’s deployed at scale”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*David Saabye, SVP of Customer Experience @ Adweek*

&amp;#x200B;

Through smart contracts, the Adbank platform will be able to provide realtime payments for every ad watched, so that the transaction from advertiser to publisher happens in realtime when running an ad-campaign.

Adbank has developed an AI (which they have a patent pending on) which tracks every traqnsaction within their ecosystem and flags fraudulent activity so that a human can double check situation and ""follow the money"" so to say, if a transaction is deemed fraudulent, actions will be taken. Now remember, this is putting it very simplisticly, there is a set of different algorithms, code and procedures taking place in tracking the fraudulent activity. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all could just be so called ""fluff"" and have nothing backing it up. How do you verify that anything they say is true and not all just a big sham? It's not unheard of in the crypto space. 

There are articles and pressreleases by the parties involved, events that the company attends to and different statements from 3rd parties. Adbank has run pilot campaigns with the Austrian government body ANTO and RedBull, aswell as with adweek and flixxel. An article has been published on forbes about it, you can read about it [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ginaclarke/2018/09/25/the-viral-video-that-convinced-the-austrian-national-tourism-office-to-embrace-blockchain/#f9bf52c1b5ae). 

Adbank has attended the United Nations forums about blockchain and actually been awarded.

[https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-cso-kelsey-cole-receives-award-at-united-nations-on-international-peace-day-833a23417fbb](https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-cso-kelsey-cole-receives-award-at-united-nations-on-international-peace-day-833a23417fbb)

They have founded the blockchain research commitee at IAB (Interactive Advertisment Buerau), all the big players within the industry is apart of it. [https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-joins-interactive-advertising-bureau-iab-to-start-blockchain-committee-d85c51e58f96](https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-joins-interactive-advertising-bureau-iab-to-start-blockchain-committee-d85c51e58f96)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to post about all of their achievments, but you can read more about them here, [in their medium blog.](https://medium.com/@adbank)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'ts these kinds of ""gems"" the more serious crypto investors are searching for, with a real usecase and a service to provide. The ones that follow all the regulations and are actually legit companies working to provide a solution to a problem. There is so much potential in this space and in a few years time, we will see that blockchain will actually provide some game changing services to different industries. I'ts up to the savvy investors to take advantage of the current situation regarding the uncertanty surrounding the space and make some life changing investments. Adbank's marketcap is currently at 2 000 000 USD which is comparable to the lower penny stocks. The risk / reward ratio on throwing in a few hundred to thousand bucks on a promising project like this is unheard of.

&amp;#x200B;

If this post even made you look at crypto a little differently, my job here is done.

Thank you and happy ""gem"" hunting.

27,2018-11-06,hbratt69,1,11/6 News (and predictions) of Day,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently joined Reddit on the advice of a best friend of mine while also (finally) opening my own trading account. I have found a lot of helpful, as well as unhelpful, content on here and I wanted to do my best to be helpful to people as well. As such, when I have time I plan on doing a daily overview of current events as well as how I see them playing out in the markets. I'm interested in working for a hedge fund or doing equity research, so naturally writing something like this would not only help on that front but also allow others to engage with me and challenge my ideas. Please note that the opinions stated here are the thoughts of just another retail investor and I am not expressly stating what you should or should not do with your portfolio. With that said, here goes nothing...

&amp;#x200B;

**What's Happening**

* Elections are today (so get out and vote, otherwise don't complain about the outcome)! Many see the Democrats taking control of the House and winning more gubernatorial seats with the Republicans maintaining the Senate. This result could help with Trump's infrastructure plan, which could offer a boost to companies like US Steel (NYSE:X) or Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT). I still remember when Trump won the election and US Steel saw a jump to $39.44 at one point. Regardless of who wins, markets tend to do well through Q2 of the next year, so it should be interesting to see the winners and losers. I could see construction and clean energy stocks doing well with tech giants seeing further declines, assuming regulation is pursued against them. I think financials could go either way depending on regulatory proposals put forth by the Democrats. 
* According to JPM, share buybacks by companies are on the rise. A notable example includes one by Buffet at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) of $1bn in August. They recently invested in fintech firm Paytm, an Indian company that offers a mobile payment platform. Buffet is sitting on \~$111bn in cash which to me is indicative of his not seeing any opportunities at the present. I could very well see him waiting for the next downturn (ie recession) to swoop in and make some purchases at discounted prices, as he is not one to overpay, and thus leading BRK.B to higher levels than we currently see.
* Optimus Ride just partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) for its autonomous vehicle fleet to upgrade to Level 4 (meaning little human interaction is needed in the operation of a vehicle) vehicles. Nvidia has its DRIVE platform that allows for synthetic testing, meaning that billions of miles in test drives and AI can be simulated without having to ever hit the road. I'm curious to see how the race toward autonomous vehicles turns out with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) being in competition with Nvidia. From my research, however, it appears that Intel is more involved with hardware (chips) whereas Nvidia is more involved with software (AI and synthetic testing). Intel also recently acquired MobilEye which further pushes them ahead. Given each company has partnerships with many large automobile manufacturers, I believe that each can excel in their respective space and reap large profits from this new business in the years to come, bolstering their stock prices in the years to come once we finally see these new fleets completely rolled out.

If you actually read through all this... thank you! Please leave feedback for me, your thoughts on what I presented, or anything else you care to share."

29,2018-12-30,Lccole2969,1,New P2P Lending App Call Lenmo or GoLenmo,"So, I found an app on the App Store, obviously it has begun to disappoint me, there are several bad reviews and others have “Claimed Fraudulent Activity”, such as it could be stealing their identities.

Anyhow, I applied for a loan, the app has several stages the request (loan request) passes through, let me explain:

Borrower ask for loan &gt; Lender sends offer &gt; Borrower approves offer &gt; Lender signs off on offer or Declines Offer &gt; Loan Closed and Funds transfer begins.

[Lenders have 48 Hours to Approve a Loan]

However, during this stage, lenders become uninterested, some reviews have claimed the undisclosed return on revenue (APR Annualized Personal Loans). Make lenders back-out, but lenders often resort to increasing the interest rate, even to the 100s/interest rate. So, after like several offers came through and no lender approved the offers, I started to doubt and fear. You see, I even accepted a loan upwards of 70% interest rate. You see is not what you think; there is no loan origination fees and any fees are small, taking on the loan has its benefits. Lenmo or GoLenmo.com, doesn’t pull credit reports nor reports loans to credit bureaus. Mathematically speaking loans aren’t even ‘amortized loan’. And so, you have no perioric interest rate or bolloon payments to worry about, the formula is confusing because is not considered a monthly rate. And often lenders confused and baited, take no calculations beforehand and I can actually understand why would some who offers 25% IR would think they would receive 25 percent of the pie. Nonetheless, the annual return is actually less than that.

Thus far, all of this seems quite sketchy, a few patches here and there but users are beginning to think the offers aren’t being fulfilled because internal algorithms or buggy-like features, even bad UI grammar. Everything is questionable ofcourse, even at these beta stages, apps in the fintech arena should be more cautious. Has anyone use this app?

Right now, privacy laws forbids companies from disclosing personal information even if you’re a small platform going in-between to arrange loan contracts on behald of two users (US Laws). So, Lenmo uses their initials to identify users, mines is ‘LC’ and the loan I requested was for 1,100. Ultimately I would have paid $11 in fees, in comparison with Prosper and Lending Club, this isn’t too bad of a cut. I am currently waiting on the final approval from investor ‘BT’ and this is the 4th time I confirmed a loan and likewise it simply doesn’t get closed. The customer service appears to be dead or just as confused. I did found a lender who on Instagram, told me how he simply gave up as he couldn’t even lend any money. Another borrower on FB who said, the loan took 2 weeks to arrive, but did eventually. Got any stories about this app, or is my information unsecured, most probably stolen? Who Knows."

I do not day trade but also don't consider myself a long-term traders hence I'm always interested in making few speculative bets in my free time. With Tech companies, you could easily tell whether you're in the right trade after 1-2 years of holding that particular stock.

 I definitely enjoy the thrill of it and also love making money for making speculative bets on hot tech stocks so if you have a company stock on your mind right now, feel free to leave a comment below because I've not been keeping up with this market for the last 2 years. The recent downturn of some of the biggest stocks such as (Google, Netflix, Amazon and Facebook) do scare me a bit however I'm certain these Tech giant's stock will eventually rebound.  


Also are there any VC firms out there that you would recommend I should keep up to date with? What are some of the top VC firms that focus on Tech/Fintech investment (have a good track record for doing so)! Open to all suggestions at the moment, basically I'm returning to the market after a long break. Hopefully you guys could let me in on some hidden gems, much appreciated!"
