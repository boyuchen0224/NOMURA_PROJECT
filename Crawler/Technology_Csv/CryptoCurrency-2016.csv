Continue to transfer your hard earned money to fund managers, like a good citizen.","Everything is obvious in retrospect.  Sure people have been calling an oil crash for 12 months now, but you simply cannot time the market.  
  
No one could have predicted^tm that the markets would tank in early 2016.  Even though China's market manipulation was blatant, and it was also obvious that a tanking Chinese market would cause other markets to crumble, *we simply couldn't have known*.  Junk debt collapsed a few months ago, and yes that has always signaled an incoming market crash, but remember that past performance doesn't indicate the future.  Even as we speak your mutual fund managers are earning their thick six-figure salaries (and huge bonuses) by pouring over all the ways their fund can lose less money than the other funds, and they are only charging you a few measly percent for this expert work.  
  
You absolutely should not attempt to go it alone!  You cannot hope to invest on your own, and you do not know what will happen next!  
  
Yes, the stock market might collapse by 50% or more this year, but don't pull your money out until the storm passes.  You'll miss all the gains on the way back up that will make you whole!  
  
You are a good citizen and we are proud of you.  Continue to leave the investing to the professionals, keep watching Bloomberg and CNBC, and hey: it's probably time to dive into that new Bogglehead book!  
  
Some of your friends are probably going to get very 'rich' this year on idiotic gambles like put contracts and cryptocurrency but stay the course.  In just thirty or forty years, financial independence will be yours!  "
1,2016-01-11,americanpegasus,0,Here's why it's time to invest in Bitcoin in these crazy markets (TheStreet.com),"TheStreet posted a pretty basic article with this title recently, hitting a few key points and overlooking some others.  
  
http://www.thestreet.com/story/13416506/1/here-s-why-it-s-time-to-invest-in-bitcoin-in-this-crazy-market.html  
  
Yes, Chinese and others looking for hard assets will find a safe refuge in Bitcoin that will only propel it's price higher as more people look to acquire it.  This is the Speculative stage of money, and Bitcoin would be no better than a common stock or gold if this were true.  
  
But they are ignoring key components of cryptocurrency: the ability to transcend its role as a speculative vehicle and create an actual transactional economy.  Some may argue that not much of a transactional economy can emerge with Bitcoin's current blocksize limitations, but there are many advanced protocols and proposals to fix that in the works.  As well there are many other amazing features, such as the ability to write data securely in a way that it can never be altered (still every computer around the world running Bitcoin has a copy of my poem I wrote last year, and they will forever as long as Bitcoin has value).  
  
Anyway, Bitcoin has essentially doubled its price in the past three months and I don't care how you want to spin it: that chart looks healthy - http://i.imgur.com/M8lXVZc.jpg  
  
2016 may be the year of the next big Bitcoin run... Remember, to create a decentralized and global financial network from nothing it **must** slowly rise from nothingness and undergo several dramatic expansion cycles (by price).  There is no other way to realistically do it.  
  
In other words, you cannot create a secure, global, and decentralized financial network without accidentally making a few people very wealthy - that is why Bitcoin makes such an attractive investment.  "
2,2016-01-08,americanpegasus,0,Everyone here who wants to be way ahead of the curve needs to know about Cryptonote.,"In 2009, a dweebish computer program which could create digital money rose up from the depths and became world famous.  It was launched anonymously and no one is still sure who created it, but it doesn't matter: it's open source.  You don't need to trust anyone and that's the beauty of it: it was the first trustless digital money.  
  
These nerdy tokens went from a few cents each to hundreds of dollars each, making many people instantly wealthy.  
  
You already know these tokens as **Bitcoins** and as frustrated as you may be at the notion, the world is waking up to the idea of borderless digital money that no one controls.  
  
*But Bitcoin is not private.*  It also has no current method inside it to scale.  
  
This means that it is highly likely that going forward Bitcoin becomes a large and public international settlement system, and not necessarily the digital money messiah everyone had hoped.  That doesn't mean it won't be valuable (it will), but just that it won't be the only serious cryptocurrency in the world.  
  
I humbly suggest you educate yourself on a new protocol that came out in 2014 called **Cryptonote**.  It also was launched anonymously, is open source, and uses some of the most advanced mathematics our species has ever wielded.  
  
Why is it important?  It adds privacy at the protocol layer through transaction mixing via something called 'cryptographic ring signatures'.  This means that not only are your transactions untraceable but also that your holdings are immune from public scrutiny too.  I don't think I need to explain why having strong mathematical  privacy by default is superior.   
  
It also scales using an adaptive blocksize limit so it totally sidesteps all current transaction limitations the Bitcoin network has.  
  
Finally, the two largest Cryptonote implementations both incorporate trailing emissions meaning *they are not deflationary.*. There will always be new currency left to compete for and mint by aspiring computers.  
  
--------    
  
But both are very new, and very risky.  In order for a financial universe to arise from nothing and become large enough to handle transactions on the order of billions of dollars, it must undergo several exponential growth cycles (as Bitcoin has done).  This necessary evil also creates opportunity for those who see the potential early to make some well placed high-risk longshots.  If you find the next big financial network early, you have a chance to become the next group to find themselves riding it's waves into extreme wealth.  
  
Please take some time to look into Cryptonote implementations, including Monero (/r/Monero), because one or more will likely be a massive global financial network by the 2020s.  The Monero network might only be worth a paltry few million dollars today, but this is going to change dramatically in time.  One alternative I am heavily involved with is called Aeon, but it is even smaller than Monero.  Another is called Boolberry.  
  
Happy reading, and I hope you'll take the time to get ahead of the curve.  It's not popular yet, but the technology is such a quantum leap ahead of anything else being used I would be surprised if it doesn't eventually dominate.  These things just take time.  "

--------------------  
  
When the genius points to the moon, the fool looks at the finger.  Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin does so many things well - including acting as a safe net for capital flight out of China.  But what people are missing is the bigger picture.  As usual, the fund managers will call the technology idiotic all the way up until they hear their friends are buying it... and then they'll all say ""*well it should have been obvious...*""  
  
As well, the cryptocurrency universe is a lot larger than just Bitcoin these days.  That's why representatives from Bain Capital and Fidelity Investments are at the Satoshi Roundtable discussion this weekend: http://satoshiroundtable.org/

Most developing country currencies have also been hard hit, with the Russian ruble losing nearly 21% and Brazilian real losing 30%. Bitcoin, a borderless currency that is governed by mathematics, outperformed any other currency in 2015.

A study by Magister Advisors shows that Bitcoin could be the 6th largest currency by 2030 for volumes traded. Estimates show that banks and financial institutions are set to spend at least $1 billion in the cryptocurrency in its development and for its underlying technologies. Bitcoin is attracting the sharp attention span of Wall Street, and we can therefore conclude that bitcoin is undergoing substantial development and progress, and contrary to the recent media opinion, is quite definitely alive.

7,2016-02-16,[deleted],0,What path to choose if you’re planning on investing through cryptocurrency,[removed]
8,2016-02-11,americanpegasus,0,"With the IMF urging a move to all digital money (so they can impose negative interest rates) and a current flight into gold, now is the time to get interested and involved in cryptocurrency (more than ever).","JPM just said that something must be very wrong for people to be fleeing back into gold, and it most certainly is.  (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-11/jpm-ficc-head-people-have-more-confidence-gold-bank-deposits-or-paper-money)  
  
The world is waking up to the realization that nothing is sacred and all money is a set of convenient rules we have agreed on to transact with each other.  You could call it 'imaginary' but that wouldn't be totally accurate: it is the group belief in an asset that gives it power and authority.  
  
Until now we have relied on megabanks to set monetary policy for the world but there are signs that a titanic meltdown may be happening within that furnace.  Signs if this are everywhere, including conspiring to force the world to move to an all-digital financial ecosystem so dramatic negative rates can be imposed: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-10/something-very-disturbing-spotted-morgan-stanley-presentation-slide.  I won't engage in any 'told you so' here; I simply want to urge you to get involved in cryptocurrency, even as a mental excursion.  
  
The IMF certainly is, and it is very likely that by the 2020s global finance will run on top of a combination of these new fangled 'blockchains'.  
  
You have many reputable projects to choose from, and a few other fringe ones if you want to get your feet wet with experimental cryptography.  
  
**Bitcoin**: the original implementation of decentralized digital money.  It is the largest and most well known Blockchain in the world.  It's use of a public ledger and necessary transition to a deflationary and fee-based economy has caused criticism, but there is likely a bright future ahead of it (cue the trolls badgering me about sidechains).  
  
**Ethereum**: a Blockchain purporting to use its tokens as programmable nodes in a cloud computer.  It's value has been on a tear lately, and despite having initially sold as an IPO (something many in the community find distasteful) it has been publicly supported by both Nick Szabo and Microsoft.  
  
**Monero**: The largest current Cryptonote implementation, it was the first major Blockchain to add privacy and anonymity into a decentralized and digital Blockchain.  It is tiny at the moment but arguably has the most advanced financial technology in the entire world.  
  
**[Tangle-based Ideas]**:  there are some new currencies that are aiming to work via a new method that doesn't use a Blockchain at all, but I have not fully reviewed them and they are very new concepts.  
  
**[Zerocash]**: the strongest form of cryptocurrency that we have ever invented is actually a little too strong as currency destroying bugs might be undetectable, a non-zero number of trusted parties is required at Genesis, and it is untested cryptography.  Nevertheless research into this continues.  
  
**[R3]**:  Blythe Masters, JP Morgan, and everyone else involved in this are attempting to take Bitcoin and turn it into a 'shared spreadsheet' which is a catastrophic waste of time and money.  A reversible Blockchain that uses trust is the same thing we have now, and defeats the entire point.  They are basically marveling at the Internet, and have decided to reinvent cable television based off of it.

-------  
  
So, many of you (including top investment professionals at major firms) are probably wondering: ""Pegasus, *wow*!  What's next?""  
  
Well, I'll tell you again, like I always do.  2016 is going to be a crazy year folks; you better buckle up.  
  
**This market isn't going back up until it goes down a lot more!**  
  
I'm calling for a major crash to really punctuate this recent spiral, and I mean something nasty.  I'm expecting a spring time frame, probably in March (yes, as in next month!)  
  
Oil isn't going anywhere.  Expect capitulation to occur as we finally hit $17 a barrel, and possibly lower.  Only then will we go back up, and even then it will take a while to recover.  Bottom line: people trying to catch the falling knife in oil are gonna get burned.  
  
I expect talk of QE4 to begin after the crash though, and it won't be able to come soon enough!  Without QE4 we may see a bottom of 1100 in the S&amp;P by this time next year.  With Q&amp;E?  Well I can't foresee how much magical pretend money the government will print into the stock market, but the reckoning we will face will be the same.     
   
It's simple math: hard assets are going to be precious luxuries soon.  The paper gold market is in for an upheaval as we collectively discover that paper gold is currently a major sham, but the world isn't going back to precious metals... No, the way forward isn't shiny rocks but decentralized digital networks.  
  
This R3 thing the banks are working on?  Because they have so fundamentally misunderstood what a decentralized blockchain is, it will falter and fail.  The banks will use it, of course, in order to try to justify the millions they will spend making it.  But they will eventually abandon it in favor of a true decentralized alternative.  
  
Speaking of which, for a year now I've been intrigued and 'infiltrating' the world of new *private* digital financial networks.  These use protocol level cryptography for financial privacy.  Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero and Aeon are likely to become very big deals in coming years (but I am invested in them, and represent them, so don't take my word for it - check out the cutting edge Cryptonote protocol they are based off of).   
  
The stock market isn't going to implode forever, and I expect a new mega bull run to kick off before 2020, but it's not going to start without some pain first.   
  
Money itself is going to experience it's 'uber moment' and we may even begin to see regulated crypto-securities.  If R3 ever finds a real world niche, it could potentially be here, but I still wouldn't bet on it.  
  
Anyhow, I wouldn't be fucking with anyone at the moment, especially not the 50 - 200 P/E companies that boast 'lots of users'.  You thought LinkedIn's mega crash was news?  More are coming.  
  
You'll know when this tech 2.0 bubble has fully crashed back to Earth because we will be considering the long term viability of even juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon.  And here's where you buy back in.  
  
It's easier said than done now, because when the time comes to buy back in we may truly be in the throes of a major economic crisis.  People will scoff at owning Facebook, Google, or Apple stock but that is where you must go.  
  
The big winners in the next bull run?  The sci-fi tech of tomorrow: virtual reality, self-driving cars, digital money, 3D printing, and AI.  
  
Anyway, I've said enough.  I'm happy to see this crash finally get underway because I know that on the other side of every crash lies opportunity - I just would caution against trying to catch this one on the way down.  You may say to ""buy fear"" but I would argue we haven't even seen fear yet - we're just getting started here.  
  
As always, note that this is all my own opinion and I am not an investment professional.  I am not licensed to give financial advice to anyone, and have no current market positions, long or short.  I only own 100% cryptocurrency at the moment, which I plan to hold for the foreseeable future, and partially diversify from once this market is much lower.  
  
Feel free to disagree with me and be on the wrong side of history yet again.

With that preface laid out, I'd like to talk about the one ""fun"" gamble I've learned how to create into an investing strategy.

The way I see it, there are 2 ways to place your money with intention. First you can think about long/short term confidence you have in a investment moving in a certain direction. The second is to place your money on your confidence of speculation of others in the market.

The second example above causes move volatility, risk+reward opportunities.
I know this is old news for most experienced guys and gals here so I'll get to the point.

I've seen some deep and silly conversations about cryptocurrency on here, but I feel if we take away the stigma we can see there are strategies to extract wealth from those markets.

1) They are very emotional
2) They are tech driven projects so they lack true deep confidence among the populous
3) They have sustained for the past 5+ years so they're probably not going away.
4) They attempt to represent economic models that are well studied in previous economic lessons or simulations.

With all that stated, I've simply followed the highs and the lows of those communities and I've made out very well... When all is depressed I buy, when things are euphoric, I sell.

15,2016-06-28,flamingwarbear,0,A newbie's perspective before taking the plunge.,"Greetings /r/investing,

In the past few weeks I've been preparing to enter the exciting world of investing and so I decided to impart some of my perceptions on how this all works and if you feel so inclined you can reply.

As an uneducated trader I started with cryptocurrency(don't downvote just yet) with marginal success but got out of that game soon after because while I believe cryptocurrency has a strong place in the future it is currently a very niche market with price fluctuations based mostly on memes. I believe it's one of the most toxic environments I've ever been in.

Soon after I was exposed to an employee matched 401k and tinkered with it obsessively. But I wasn't satisfied with the rate of return. I wanted to be more active with my investments while also earning a higher rate of return. 

I have no investment contributions or savings and just started working a ""real"" job @ 30 y.o. so I feel like I must aggressively invest to close the gap between those 8 or so years I missed out.

I frequent /r/stocks, /r/investing, /r/wallstreetbets, and regrettably 4chan biz, the latter two I'm thinking of exiting. To me those communities seem to be filled with gamblers, pump and dumps, profiting from the inexperienced, etc.  It's certainly an intoxicating environment as well but no a healthy one.

Yesterday I googled something along the lines of *Did Warren Buffett make wall street bets?*. In the brief biography I found you could certainly argue that he did make major bets but they all seemed very educated verging on the point of insider info. While the guy had impeccable business savvy it seemed like he rode the coat tails of Graham and others.

For normies like us we don't have access to a brilliant investor pointing you at stocks and we aren't able to visit with CEOs to discuss their business plans at length.

And lastly, value investing. Based on Graham and Buffett's careers I've been examining the real values of stocks and it doesn't seem to make sense at all. *Every* single stock I found was overvalued by large margins. Is it so binary as *invest in undervalued stock and don't invest in overvalued stock*? Wouldn't there already be an algorithm somewhere with a list that says ""The 100 most undervalued stocks"" and then they become instantly overvalued as people buy them?

These are just some musings of a likely ignorant novice that I hope will incite some type of advice. "

In addition to the obvious competitors, every tech company, bank, or telco would like to eat their lunch. And then there is government regulation to worry about, including the occasional anti-trust lawsuit!

Of course there would be... look at $MA and $V margins.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Mastercard Inc | $9,883M | 55% | 64%
Alliance Data Systems Corporation | $6,515M | 28% | 30%
American Express Company | $34,594M | 27% | 23%
Fiserv Inc | $5,310M | 30% | 28%
Global Payments Inc | $2,858M | 22% | 36%
Paypal Holdings Inc | $9,655M | 23% | 12%
Visa Inc | $14,280M | 69% | 24%

Mastercard Inc has $3,812M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 4% of the market value of Mastercard Inc. Though I'm always a bit wary of cash figures for any business in a quasi financial services industry.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $108.34 for Mastercard Inc and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 22% to their target. 

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. Now, I'm rarely a fan of businesses that are trading in the high 20s, but the growth has been good and they do seem to have *moat*. Is this a Quality purchase? Rather than Value or Growth?

MA | $96,154M | 25x | 15% | 1% | 5%

PYPL.O | $46,239M | 26x | 18% | 0% | 4%
V | $182,493M | 27x | 14% | 1% | 4%

# Dividends
Mastercard Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.73 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.70 per share. That is a 4% growth. Given a EPS forecast of $3.54 it doesn't look generous.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -5% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 0%. That's against a backdrop of revenues up 10%.

For me the obvious catalysts are earnings, the global economy and the move online. All are clear positives for the giants, $MA, $V and Paypal. But these aren't really anything to write home about :( Perhaps their is international consolidation in emerging markets like China, card adoption in markets like India that can also drive growth? 

And on the downside? regulation and the tech giants? Though given how slow consumer adoption is in finance, I can't see an immediate threat on the tech front.

23,2016-11-22,BeautifulLadies,0,I'm starting to look at gold. Looking good.,"This would hinge completely on gold price recovering but reward would be massive.

I like companies that are ignored by the market (another reason I'm getting out of weed stocks now).

Something that people really stay away from (for obvious reasons) are countries that have had political strife. However, often people fail to realize when that place is safe again and a good place to do business. 

I found a few companies yesterday after doing some research that are in such jurisdictions, that have had respectable revenue growth and have been profitable and even grown EPS with low gold prices. 

They're getting completely ignored by the market, except today they were being noticed a little.

Macroeconomically, gold price sort of has to recover. I mean people could place their faith in Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency but that cannot take the value out of gold in any meaningful way, likely not for 25-100 years and probably never.

A lot of countries are near their [all time high for their debt VS 1 year gdp](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/government-debt-to-gdp).

Debt hasn't been used wisely and our currencies, likely even the USD, will begin to devalue. I think anyways. That's a long-term reason why gold will increase.

But in the short term, fear around Trump coming into office at noon on January 20 should be a healthy thing for gold price.

[http://www.incrementum.li/en/research-analysis/in-gold-we-trust-2016/](http://www.incrementum.li/en/research-analysis/in-gold-we-trust-2016/)

Page 136-141 are a nice summary of why gold will likely increase - this helps me justify to myself why I gamble instead of invest.

Of course I could be parking my money in a nice GoldCorp type company, but no. I'm looking at junior producers in geographies that have only 'recently' become politically stable. I've found ones with growing revenue, EPS, and good debt/assets, just because I want to have some chance of actually winning these gambits. But of course, they all still offer high returns (and astoundingly high risk).

Here's some I like for the coming year:

(TSX:BAA) [Democratic Republic of Congo] Banro Corp.

(TSX:GCM) [Colombia] Gran Colombia Gold Corp.

(TSX:OMI) [Uraguay] Orosur Mining Inc.

(TSX:TMM) [Mexico/US/Canada] Timmins Gold Corp.

(TSX:SAM) [Mexico] Starcore International Mines Ltd.
