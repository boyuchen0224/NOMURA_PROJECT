0,2018-02-08,LZCam,10,Tobii (Sweden) - What am I missing?,"Hi! I read this forum a lot for advice and guidance, but haven't felt the need to post until now.

I invest in foreign shares, not just US, and I've been tracking a company in Sweden called Tobii. The price seems down, and I'm not sure what I'm missing:

- The market leaders in eye tracking technology
- 2 solid, profitable business units that arguably support the current valuation on their own
- A growth, consumer electronics, focused business unit.
- Eye tracking technology is widely regarded as a must have for VR and AR devices.
- Their 3 main competitors have been acquired by Apple, Google, and Facebook in the last 2 years.
- They have announced they are actively working with 5 major customers for launch in 2018/2019, and in dialogue with a potential 10 more.

To me it seems like a perfect storm for a tech breakthrough, but the price continues to gradually go lower, and lower. The best I can tell is the market is weary of waiting for actual announcements of partnerships (they do have laptops out with Alienware, Acer and MSI though).

I can't help but feel that if this company was based in Silicon Valley, and listed on the main NASDAQ, it would be much more hyped.

I'm not a technical analyst, I invest based on my overall view of a company's prospects, and probably I look at it a little too simplistically. So if anyone has any thoughts, I would love to hear them."

2,2018-03-03,JumpinJulius,0,Thoughts on nvidia (graphics card company) now that VR headsets are on the rise,"So I just got a vr headset and it is astounding. Everyone who has tried it has loved it and wanted one. This got me thinking. Which vr company would be the best to invest in. But if any of them are successful nvidia will do well. Of course it is too expensive for most people to want to buy one right now but computer prices always drop. I think nvidia even provides the graphics cards for play stations. In addition, I know lots of people buying cards for mining which doesn't hurt. "
3,2018-04-12,sasksean,46,On Micron and why the memory market is not cyclical anymore.,"Every GPU sold requires huge quantities of expensive RAM and availability of that RAM is what determines how many chips Nvidia or AMD can sell. Somehow Nvidia warrants a P/E ratio of 50 but Micron only a 5 even though Nvidia is the one holding it's bowl out at the doorstep of the memory fabs.

Memory is baked into so many products now that the market demand is nearly in crisis. Tensor cores, video surveillance, portable VR, autonomous machines, crypto-currency... memory is a commodity that is suddenly found to be so much more ubiquitous than it used to be. Historic trends of even two years ago have no relevance anymore.

There is also an AI cold war brewing and Micron is the only large US based manufacturer of memory. The US government will not allow it to fail. China can't afford to tariff Micron either because they have no domestic fabs and want all the AI resources they can buy. They are desperate to get their own production online but that will take years and the AI supremacy war will be in full swing by then. China will consume all the resources it can manufacture and would be reluctant to allow it's foundries to fuel foreign AI regardless.

There will be an explosion of demand in the next five years and the projected supply increase will not be able to keep up.

The current value of Micron has an assumption that the price of RAM will crash already baked in. If it doesn't crash, the current valuation of the company is low by a magnitude. It's absurd. I'm growing suspicious of anyone bearish on Micron as being part of a propaganda machine."
4,2018-04-10,ban_human_traffickin,0,Just bought 2000 shares of Facebook (FB) @ $161. Here's why,"For the past 5 years, Facebook has shown steady growth and growing earnings, and the stock has gone nowhere but up. The latest FUD (fear uncertainty doubt) propagated by the media will be short lived, just like the FUD with EA a while back. 

More importantly, Facebook is more than just Facebook. Facebook owns WhatsApp, Instagram, and more. They are also pioneering VR and AI technologies. Facebook is the king of advertisement. Facebook is here to stay. 

I think Facebook will at least touch the $190s again after they release earnings this month. I recommend buying now. I myself just bought 2000 shares at $161. There's no reason not to.

5,2018-06-25,Warpeous,0,Apple is no longer paving the future in tech,"Smart speakers caught Apple flat footed. The HomePod was a flop, with numerous reports revealing Apple cut back orders after weak demand. My biggest problem with HomePod was that it only supported Apple Music, not Spotify. This made no sense if Apple wanted to dominate the market. HomePod could’ve been another platform for app makers, like iPhone, Mac, and even iMessage which has its own App Store and developers.

Wearables are not the future of tech. Apple may be the largest watch maker, but watches are a tiny market, and that’s like being a humpback whale in a koi pond. 

Apple has dipped its pinky toe in augmented and virtual reality, having an app section for augmented reality and creating a few applications like a virtual measuring tape and a virtual ping-pong game, but they haven’t created their own headset to compete with Oculus or HoloLens. Now virtual reality is nowhere near where it needs to be to catch on as the technology still isn’t there and the price tag is too high, but even then, anyone who has put on a virtual reality headset will tell you how impressive the experience truly is. And yet Apple is moot on VR.

Apple’s investment in original content is a joke, buying Carpool Karaoke and hiring Oprah. Just like smartspeakers, Apple’s original content seems to be a lackluster response to what other tech industry giants like Amazon and Google are doing with their own original content. Amazon Studios is making well received content being shown in movie theaters, like The Big Sick, and Google’s YouTube is getting into original content with the well-received show Cobra Kai.

Most important of all is the fact Apple continues to drop the ball on apps that are data intensive in order to function properly. Siri require lots of data to be able to answer questions, which is why Siri sucks. Apple Maps requires lots of data to construct maps, which is why Apple Maps sucks. So Apple may be angling to take the higher ground by saying it doesn’t use your data, and that’s fine, but when data-intensive apps start to suffer, it may be time for Apple to take a new approach.

The butterfly keyboards on MacBooks have been universally faulty, to the point Apple has started a free repair program. The removal of the headphone jack is still being questioned 2 years later. The tablet market as a whole is shrinking. Android phones are just as good if not better than iPhones. 

Now Warren Buffett may have doubled down on buying Apple stock, and from an accounting view that’s an obvious choice. Apple is by far the most profitable company right now. But that doesn’t make it the future of tech. And when Apple picks fights with companies like Facebook, it’s probably why there’s no Instagram app for iPad. 

I’ve been watching Apple’s market cap for the past 6 months, and right now it’s the lowest it’s ever been, hovering around $906 B, when it’s usually around $936 B. Amazon is catching up at around $825 B, Google is trailing at $806 B, while Microsoft is lagging at around $760 B. Personally I find following market caps more fun that serious, but the fact Apple has flirted with the trillion dollar market cap but hasn’t passed it for this long while other tech companies keep closing the gap, it’s starting to look like Apple is no longer the groundbreaking tech company of the future."
6,2018-06-24,luchins,2,Which will be in the next bubble in a decade/20years from now?,"What  do you think  will be  the next bubble?

7,2018-06-14,mbmike12,1,Opinion Change - VR potential,"I got the chance to mess around with VR today and holy crap.  It changed my mind on the product.  Museums, educational purposes, simulating complex processes - it all gets presented in the optimal way through VR.  

If you like me and pretty much can't enjoy museums because of all the etiquette, standing, and red tape, your mind will change if you can sit down and sip a beer while you move around the Louvre looking at the most famous paintings in the world.

I think it might not happen anytime soon, but the companies that are making headway in VR will be able to make some serious profits when entire classrooms learn about relativity and planetary formation with VR headsets on with the teacher showing them how stars explode right before their eyes.

The jump-scare and rollercoaster stuff isn't for me, but diving into paintings, black holes, and space was pretty insane.

9,2018-07-29,_Thrillhouse_,6,Virtual Reality Companies,"I have a bit of a weird question and I apologize if this is the incorrect subreddit for this.  


For you to understand the question I have to give you a very quick backstory and explain my situation.

Almost 2 years ago, I got a new job that I very much enjoy and have started making a bit more money than I recently did. 

I've been trying for once in my life to get smart about finances so I made out a plan, started budgeting, read multiple books, and even got a financial planner.  To skim over everything, for the first time in my life I'm feeling like I might actually be safe and stable for a while. I'm very frugal in most ways, I pay off my credit card debt, mortgage and car payments have never been missed and I have a good credit score.

But for the first time with a bit of disposable income, I wanted to do two things: get healthy and set aside a fund of money for ""riskier"" investments, as a sort of hobby. I have done minor stuff here and there, generally been mostly basically broke even, maybe an occasional profit but nothing serious. But I'm always watching stuff and reading about them almost out of curiosity. Like a little game or challenge to see if your assessment and predictions become true or not.

So to get healthy I bought a HTC Vive. I heard you move around a bunch, I enjoy gaming, and I loved Sci-Fi movies and books and always thought the idea of VR was cool but it's been disappointing every time I've tried it. So again to skim over, I'm fully on board with this technology. It's fucking insane how much you move. There are some games that I literally can't play for more then 20-30 minutes. I added wrist weights to add to it and I mean it feels like a full on, better than usual workouts at a gym. Both cardio and muscle. It's finally here. It's not the end version, it's a couple off, but it's a couple years, not decades. I keep equating it to my brother this way:

Remember when we got a Nintendo 64 for Christmas when we were kids and it was like one the greatest thing ever at the time? We couldn't BELIEVE the graphics and gameplay of Mario 64. You look at that now, compared to graphics we see today, and it's laughable how simple they are. I feel like the Vive and Rift are the N64 version of VR so within 5-10 years, people are going to go HOLY SHIT, virtual reality is incredible. And it's not just gaming. They have educational experiences. You can do simulators to get over phobias. There are social functions like communities where hang out and chat. I played ping pong with a dude from Bangladash for like 30 minutes the other day, just bullshitting.   


So. To my question.

I am in no way wealthy, but I feel  secure enough that I'm trying to figure out if there's anyway to actually put in some money  into a technology that I believe is going to be literally one of those rare ""game changer"" technologies. I just can't fucking figure out how to do it. I mean would it be just investing into some stocks of companies like HTC? How can someone, completely on the outside, try to simply financially back a concept like VR but not a specific company per se? I'm just trying to figure out the most reasonable, rational, way that an every day Joe with a fair amount of research but for sure not an MBA or anything can try to take a chance?  


Any suggestions would be greatly greatly appreciated. Honestly even something like ""take out a loan and hire people to start making VR games or open a VR gymnasium"".  


And I also do understand that there are LOADS of news articles talking about how unsuccessful VR is or how the companies are this or that. I understand those may be true now, I'm just saying I am buying on the fact that I trust my judgement of the technology as a concept and the future of it, not a SPECIFIC company"
10,2018-07-20,Hungry10,0,VR &amp; AR stocks to invest,"I'm confident VR and AR are going to be the new smartphone of next decade. Just need help in which stocks to invest in, done a bunch of research but its so hard to choose which one to fully invest in. Big companies stock prices are just too much so rather want stocks that are the underground

Thanks"
11,2018-07-16,MarcImBack,4,Vuzix ($VUZI) - Pure AR Play,"Smart phones already augment our reality, however, the interface is on our phone. When using gps you need to look at your phone sometimes if you’re in an unfamiliar area. 

I never used Google Glass, but from I can tell, Vuzix is producing something that looks consumer friendly. 

Go on YouTube and there is plenty of reaction videos where people freak out. 

The Blade uses wavefront technology, which is the same eye tracking technology used for LASIK eye surgery, so it knows where you are looking and can adjust accordingly. Furthermore, this tech can be used for eye gestures down the road. 

Developer kits are being produced and will ship this year. Smart people will get their hands on them and start building apps/programs for the glasses. 

Why do I think this a good long buy? 

Oculus Rift, a solid VR producer, was bought out by Facebook. 

Vuzix offers a turn key solution for a large company interested in the AR space. 

Cheers"

What are your thoughts on the VR industry? Where do you think the best areas to invest in are? I am thinking that the video card industry will see another arms race boom, similar to what we saw with respect to bitcoin. Probably not as intense and sharp, but seeing as how GPUs are one of the primary limiting factors to producing high quality VR, I suspect that there will be a race to develop this technology further and also the quickest. "
13,2018-08-23,wirsteve,390,What's reddit's opinion of the next big thing in tech?,"Pretty obvious what it is now, ""Cloud Computing"". Companies have to ""move to the cloud"". Some companies don't even have directors of IT on staff, they just hire a consulting firm to move them to the ""cloud"" but they don't know what it is.

Let's say 5 years ago

* Everything was hosted locally or with an IT provider. Citrix for example was popular
* The number of apps in iOS app store and Play store have tripled - mobile is king
* Businesses slowly started to look at technology as a need and not as a luxury

Now 

* SaaS is king, hosting data in Azure, AWS or Google's data centers is popular
* Citrix is still used but in a different capacity
* You need a mobile app to pair with your website / company to be looked at seriously
* eCommerce has been changed dramatically with Square &amp; competitors

So what's next?

* Edge networking?
* A boom in security spending?
* Machine learning?
* Blockchain?
* VR &amp; AR?
* Internet of Things?
* Smart kitchens?
* 3D Printing?

We all know deep down, whatever the infrastructure is now, and whatever is popular now won't be in 2023. I'd love to hear what you guys think. Obviously my list isn't what you have to pick from. It's just some things that I think could potentially take off."

16,2018-08-13,sasksean,31,Nvidia earnings.,"The digicoin market has collapsed. Used high end cards are all over classifieds.

VR still has no killer apps that would create demand for high end cards.

Most people still game on 1080p@60 fps which a budget GTX1060 satisfies now.

Making a game look a magnitude better requires much larger textures. This means DRAM is a major bottleneck going forward.

Nvidia's only solid market ATM is AI and their biggest customers are all developing their own proprietary solutions.

I expect a bump in earnings for sales of GPUs to partners this quarter but weak sales of those partner's cards so a slump in earning from Nvidia in subsequent quarters.

I'm not confident in Nvidia for 2020+ but calls for the next quarter or two are likely good."

19,2018-09-27,eslerjm,1,Facebook as a Sales Platform: The case against everyone else," 

Written September, 2018 by James M. Esler

Before you read this, please visit [This Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf2W9PferpA)

The following relates to Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries. This article is not designed to recommend a buy/hold/sell position on the company.

**By the numbers**

The company currently trades at about 11 and 22 times its Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) sales and revenue over the last 12 months (respectively). From 2013 to 2017, Facebook revenue and earnings grew about 51% and 81% on average, per year (respectively). From the perspective of discounted cash flows, if the market price was static (or worse dropped) over the next three years and the company achieved a 50% CAGR, the 22x earnings multiple will be reduced to 6.5x. If the company achieved a 30% CAGR for the following 3 years after, the multiple reduces to 3x. However, that’s simply 6 years of cash flows discounted, and for a company that will be around indefinitely, the current price-to-earnings multiple is determined more than 90% by the earnings *after* the first 5 years. This is factored in to the price target (not included in this article). Additionally, the revenue per global user is about $5.97 per user currently (not including Instagram, Whatsapp, or Oculus VR). The current revenue heavily leans on Facebook’s controversial Pixel feature, though as you will see below, the revenue structure is likely to change significantly in the near term.

**Capital Structure and Expenses:**

The company’s capital structure has been very consistent since its IPO in 2012. Facebook hasn’t used bank money – only $2 billion of long term debt in the past 3 years (paid off almost immediately). Assets have increased about 48% on average every year for the past 5 years. The capital structure relies on the retention of internally generated profits. The only other deviation from the capital structure was a stock issuance for the Whatsapp acquisition (2014) – since then, the company has consistently bought back every year, including over $5 billion in Q2 2018.

With a TTM profit margin of nearly 40%, the company should not pay a dividend to shareholders. Facebook returns 25% per year to equity holders, and has increased free cash flow 51% on average each year over the past three years. The business model does not have any inventories (ex-Oculus), so cash generation is simpler and purer than many other businesses (including Amazon) – this is the reason accounts payable is an insignificant figure (&lt;$400 M). SG&amp;A at 18% of revenues in 2017, from about 23% in 2015. R&amp;D at 19% of revenue, from 27% in 2015. These are the main drivers of current bottom line growth and will likely continue to be. Margins will like continue to improve as Facebook continues to automate processes. The decrease in labor costs maybe from programs being able to replace employees.

**Regulation:**

Many investors believe regulation will compress Facebook’s margins, saying that litigation on grounds of data practices and even antitrust will erode earnings growth. Such positions are hard to justify, since Facebook competes in many circles, most notably against Google, Twitter, and Amazon.com. Further, the company does not charge users any fees, so it does not have the ability to ‘fix prices’. Litigation would be protracted if it did occur, though simple fines are much more likely. The Justice Department likely will not step in here for high profile trials. As you will see below, Facebook Inc is taking large steps to enhancing Pixel and encrypting data points to secure user data.

**Facebook and the future of shopping**

***In the near future, Facebook will be a leader in e-commerce globally.*** This will manifest through use of both Business to consumer (B2C) marketing and Rich Communication Services (RCS). Facebook consistently is making the buying experience easier, more secure, and less expensive (both monetarily and psychologically). We are in the early days of Facebook being a dominant business.

At this time, Facebook has a total of 1.47 Billion daily active users (DAU) using only Facebook (not Instagram, Whatsapp, or Oculus). Whatsapp has about 1.5 Billion daily active users, and Instagram has about 0.6 Billion DAU. On all of their platforms, Facebook Inc has about 2.5 Billion Monthly Active Users (MAU), and there is very little penetration in China at this time. Considering these numbers, about 40% of the world (ex-China) is on Facebook. For another reference point, Amazon has about 30 Million MAU (0.5% of global population). Facebook has created a social experience that does not cost anything and users receive tremendous value every single day from Facebook.com, Instagram, and Whatsapp. The users are generally able to make significant purchases, do most shopping online, and will shop at the market with the best prices/products. Thus, if Facebook can prove to its users that it can provide a better shopping experience than other online stores (Wal-Mart, Amazon, Etsy), it will be able to better connect businesses and consumers on the platforms. The better shopping experience will likely come from knowing the customer in depth, using prescriptive analytics to enhance the sales process for millions of goods and reducing the potential stresses of purchase decisions. Once achieved, Facebook will monetize by charging businesses a small markup on each customer interaction, though users will likely never pay a fee for the service explicitly.

**Main Ecosystem**

To the untrained eye, it would appear that Facebook acquired Instagram, Whatsapp, and Oculus for more users and possibly synergies. A commonly held belief is that Facebook made these acquisitions to harvest user data to sell to advertisers. Seems that very few people are unsure what Facebook has planned for these acquisitions currently, let alone in the future.

**Whatsapp** – how does it fit in? Whatsapp is the largest rival to traditional SMS texting that comes standard on mobile phones (ie Android SMS, Apple chat). Whatsapp currently supports Rich Communication Service (RCS, see generations summary below), which allows large files to be sent seamlessly without compromise. Whatsapp also uses end-to-end encryption over wi-fi so no one can see the message outside the sender and recipient (not the service provider or Facebook either). The end-to-end encryption will soon prove to be the largest competitive advantage for Facebook as an e-commerce company and also will give users confidence that Facebook Inc is a good steward of their data. Businesses selling to Facebook users need to ensure that the sales process is protected from malicious actors (ie hackers) because sensitive information will be sent over Whatsapp, including forms of payment from the user, and products from vendors (such as airline tickets). At this time, there are 1.5 Billion DAU on Whatsapp, and many of them business owners, making a strong case for B2C marketing. Whatsapp for business simply changes your Whatsapp account to a business account and now you can begin marketing with all of your original Whatsapp contacts. Your contacts can then share all of your business information with others very easily and in one place. From there, Whatsapp provides you free chatbots to communicate with clients. Facebook Inc’s Messenger App has very similar features to Whatsapp, though Messenger has only about 1 Billion MAU since spinning off just before the IPO.

**Facebook** – how does it fit in? Facebook is a leader in data aggregation, analytics, and prediction mostly on consumers, but increasingly on businesses. The longstanding idea has been to be able to ***prescribe*** what users want before they even know, based on data from its massive user population. This is prescriptive analytics, and it is the holy grail of advertising – with the potential to revolutionize the shopping experience. To be brief, prescriptive analytics in the 3rd (and final) level of data analytics, allowing for conditional probabilities to determine each step in a given process. Thus, machines will put users in touch with businesses based on the users’ preferences, and in theory, the buying process should be very easy based on millions of iterations of the same transaction.

The two drivers of purchasing on Facebook: Facebook Market place and ads in the news feed. The market place (which launched October 2016) will allows consumers to search for products specifically and the feed allows vendors to push to consumers. In both cases, the consumer will click the advertisement and begin a Whatsapp chat (see link at the beginning of this article).

**Instagram** – how does it fit in? Very similar to Facebook above, while also using RCS very efficiently. Vendors show up with images and video advertisements in the feed and also in the ‘stories’ section. Users click on the vendor and can now communicate directly to the vendor. With Instagram TV (IGTV, launched July 2018), Instagram is attempting to add a YouTube mimic. YouTube currently has over 1.8 Billion MAU and has a large head start on IGTV, though YouTube is generally a destination for users, rather than a social square. Facebook Live is a very similar product: both of these ventures will be expensive in the short term as the company pays influencers to attract users away from YouTube. Interestingly, Instagram still has room to grow, since it is increasing market share every year from its rival Snapchat, which still has 188 Million DAU.

**Oculus** – how does it fit in? Hang out with your friends virtually. This brings a new dimension to ordinary conversation. The long term goal of the acquisition is *most likely* to have the experience of trying products before you buy them. Also, VR gives a stronger attraction to users getting on Facebook’s platform, since users will find it even more convenient to know what peers and influencers are doing. The VR market has not taken off– Oculus likely has years of sunk R&amp;D and talent acquisitions costs ahead of it until costs scale down. 6g has been rumored to support peer-to-peer AR/VR.

**Summary of network communication types (ie generations):**

SMS (1g, 2g)– short messaging services, analog and digital. This service represented the entire mobile phone market from around 1980 until the early 21stcentury, and still is dominant in developing countries. The 3rd generation of mobile networks allows for much enhanced Multi-Media files to be transmitted user to user.

MMS (3g, 4g)– Multi-Media Services for the transmission of images and videos. This has been prevalent in developed economies for just over a decade, and was made possible by larger network infrastructure that led to expense scaling. While this service is an upgrade to SMS, there are still shortcomings, including file size limitations. Often, images and videos must be compressed, which is becoming more common with continuous mobile phone camera improvements. 4g allows for improved wi-fi connectivity.

RCS (wi-fi, 5g)– Rich Communication Services for easier transmission of very large files. This generation was first created in 11/2016 and is very limited currently. Many network providers do not support RCS for problems with expense scaling (AT&amp;T and Vodafone do). At the end of 2018, beginning 2019, this service will become much more ubiquitous in developed nations, allowing for quicker, larger messaging capabilities. Thus, vendors will find it much easier to send “push” advertisements, products, receipts and consumers to “pull” large files from sites, vendors, and peers seamlessly. 5g may advance to make peer-to-peer AR/VR less expensive and attainable.

·  Complementary pieces (for each of these, repeat all above micro decisions)

o  Mattress

o  Sheet sets

o  Blankets

o  Bedside tables

o  Dressers

The current sales process (above) includes over 60 micro decisions for simply buying a bed. This raises a few very important points:

1.  Many consumers will avoid buying a bed and keep what they have, even if they are uncomfortable

2.  Mistakes can happen at any of the decisions.

3.  Psychological stress can arise from buyer’s remorse if mistakes are made. Also stressful if there was a missed opportunity (FOMO)

4.  Psychological stress can arise from avoiding the purchase and living uncomfortable

Machines can make the buying process easier by way of prescriptive analytics. Consumers will soon understand this is true because the true costs are the time these decisions take and also (most importantly) the *stress* of making all of these little decisions. The stress may come from inability to make decisions (paralysis by analysis) and/or living with poor buying decisions (buyer’s remorse and FOMO).

If you research beds online, Facebook (through its “Pixel” feature) will have popups for stores you can buy from almost immediately after you research . This technique is called ‘retargeting’ and is one of the largest competitive advantages of the Facebook platform. At this time, retargeting is very awkward and unwanted. Retail stores (and Amazon) get the majority of all traffic because it feels natural to pick something on your own.

The general idea of machine learning is to help us make all decisions easier. We are still at the beginning of machine learning – only a small fraction of buying decisions (both residential and commercial) around the world are handled by machines currently. *However*, as new generations find that all decisions can be made by machines, and that by this, the consumer has a more convenient, more efficient, and overall less expensive shopping experience, sales traffic will only be online. We are likely a long way off from this, though e-commerce growth numbers clearly show we are moving in such a direction.

**Future of sales:**

If you are considering buying a bed, you search the Facebook marketplace for vendors. When you find one you like, you can begin discussing the options through Whatsapp directly (as detailed in above segment). With its Pixel feature, Facebook Inc. will maintain advantages over competitors by providing the vendor with troves of information about you as the customer. There are hundreds of quantitative data points and several qualitative data points at the disposal of vendors and users right now, though the growth of these data points will rise logarithmically until a plateau stage (several years away). Vendors are strongly encouraged to make their offering as detailed as possible so that Facebook can create better, more personalized user audiences, and visa versa.

In the near term, the consumer will become more confident that his/her data is being properly secured (ie end-to-end encryption) and will enter the sales process increasingly from social media platforms/RCS providers where they visit each and every day. Prescriptive analytics will guide the consumer toward a fitting product; however, this sales process may not be prescriptive enough until the longer term. The coordination of quantitative and qualitative data points across millions of products will eventually lead to better fitting product recommendations.

**E-Commerce example: Amazon vs. Facebook**

Whichever company knows more about you will have an easier time getting your business. This includes your friendships, your family members, your socioeconomic status, your state of health, your demographics, your personality etc. Users go on Facebook to understand their world and friends better, which is a very strong value add that is showing increasing strength year over year.

Users go to Amazon for the sole purpose of shopping, which will likely be harder to maintain because users do not get anything out of the platform outside of purchases. This traffic-generation model may not be as sustainable as that of Facebook Inc. Amazon does, in fact, have many bolt-ons like Whole Foods, Twitch, Music, Alexa, etc. so that users are stickier. Currently, very few of Amazon’s potential sales centers make a durable profit margin over 3% (ie Whole Foods is still losing money). Based on many commentaries, users are indifferent to *where* they buy something, as long as they have the most convenient, least expensive shopping experience.

Facebook’s product has durability since the user’s peers and influencers (Instagram) are constantly posting things of interest to that user. Case in point: Amazon has 30 Million Monthly users, while Facebooks platforms have estimated over 2.5 Billion. To put that in perspective– monthly, for every 1 visitor to Amazon, there are over 85 visitors to Facebook platforms. Facebook currently has a 41% net profit margin (Amazon \~ 5%) with about $22 Billion in earnings (Amazon \~ $5.5). A big advantage for Facebook from a financial perspective is that it controls no inventories, preferring to act as a toll road for B2C transactions. Amazon, however, has distribution facilities, warehouses, and many low-level employees that have the potential to reduce long term profitability.

Amazon does not have a messaging application or social media platform yet. Facebook can meet the consumer where they are rather than having the consumer come into the Amazon store. Importantly, many vendors are not comfortable yet listing on Amazon, since Amazon owns the client, essentially, and can (not to say it would) cut the vendor out of the sale. Facebook allows vendors to simply have access to consumers and data to improve the sales cycle.

In summary, the purveyor that knows more about the consumer and can execute at the lowest applicable prices will win.

I think his comments on VR are off, but he makes some very interesting points. I wonder how much movement there will be on the price once they announce HQ2.

I think his comments, especially on amount of corporate tax paid etc are all valid and it really does seem that regulation or some form of break up are the only thing stopping Amazon. "

Netflix focuses on digital movies and tv shows and their original content has been great. I think their stock will continue to go up in the near future, but without other innovation I think the big hitter is going to be Nvidia.

Their Hardware (GPUs) and software (Cuda) come at a perfect time when machine learning, AI, Pc gaming and crypto mining are literally at the early crescent stages of popping off. 

Qualcomm is working on next gen chipsets compatible with AI and VR and is making waves with 5G LTE which will further enhance smart cities and The IoT experience. 

These stocks are highly undervalued trailblazers and there has never been a better time than now to be All In tech stocks. "

24,2018-11-26,CuriosityBout,1,"Microsoft. The company everyone took for granted but whose stock performance this year was steady, consistent, and even surpassed Apple as the most valuable US company.","Microsoft, for 3 decades, has stayed in the top 10 most valuable companies. Let's put that in perspective. In 2000, GE was the most valuable company, and today it's desperate. Sears, same thing. And while Apple and Amazon surpassed $1 trillion market cap before cratering recently, Microsoft stock continually stays strong. And Google is down for the year.

Personally, I think Microsoft has a strong long term vision, strong brand, and strong lead in technology in general. This year we saw Amazon totally destroy its goodwill with the public with the whole HQ2 sham and the Stop BEZOS Bill, we saw Apple get greedy with a costly iteration of the iPhone this year that was so boring, they need to make more of last year's iPhone X model because people aren't upgrading or buying this year's minor upgrade, and we saw Facebook have the largest single day stock drop in US history, as their userbase stagnated and privacy scandals continue to be uncovered for this company. 

Microsoft wasn't always the good guy, and they were almost broken up in the 90's and early 2000's for being a monopoly. But then Apple came along with the iPod, then the iPhone, then the iPad, and Microsoft was caught flat footed. Google dominated search, and Amazon got online retail. But this didn't lead to Microsoft getting weaker, if anything it lead to Microsoft reforming its ways, working with the linux community and gaining enough trust to acquire GitHub, as well as establishing itself in social networking with buying LinkedIn. 

At this point Microsoft may not be the hip/cool/sexy company everyone wants to pour their money into, but they are stable, consistent, and reliable. They don't get greedy, they seem to have their internal affairs in order for the most part, and most importantly, they are at the forefront of augmented and virtual reality with Hololens and other headsets, and considering Apple is dipping their toe in augmented reality with apps like Measure, Google is trying out Daydream View, and Facebook bought Oculus for $3 billion, there is a real race to crack the code in VR and AR, something the tech community has tried to do for decades but couldn't because the technology wasn't there yet and they don't know the best form it should take. I used to be a skeptic of VR, then I tried out a headset at the Microsoft store and it blew me away at how incredible the experience was.

The future of tech is not a speaker that listens to your conversations and gets you to buy stuff (Amazon), the future of tech is creating a second reality with VR and a better reality with AR."
