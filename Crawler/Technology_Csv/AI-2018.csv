Bullish on e-Commerce / ePayment solutions / in-app payment? Tencent owns 20% of JD.com and a stake in Vipshop. They, of course, operate WeChat, QQZone and QQ - combined these have MAU of 980 million. Within each of these, they have finance solutions, the biggest being WeChat Pay - part of which is contributing to the 143% Year on Year revenue growth for their other business department (featuring their payment business and Cloud business). 

Did you say you like The Cloud? Don't tell me that you like AI technology, too? 

Tencent owns two AI startup labs. They also run Tencent Cloud - a cloud services provider that has access to the best advertisement machine in China: Tencent's (aforementioned) social media portfolio. 


Now, I know what you're thinking right now:

""Who is this guy, u/snight, with all of these circumstantial and qualitative comments? This isn't fundamental analysis; this is bullshit!"" 
 
Well, to those of you who like to invest on more than just trends, let me posit this: 

Apart from their massive moat, a wealth of investments and insane social media portfolio. (Oh, they also have 43 million subscribers to Tencent video and a growing investment into revenue based literature and music platforms). They also achieved 61% YoY quarterly revenue growth and 45% net profit growth. They have a P/E of only 60, and a forward P/E of 40. They also have USD 13 billion in cash. Ma Huateng - or, as I like to call him, the one true Ma - has silently, steadily and overwhelmingly built up an empire of investments upon layers upon layers of IP with access to one of the biggest user base in the world. 

My last comment is food for thought, and to me, it summarises the entire philosophy of Tencent. You may know that WeChat is a social media platform, I haven't fully fleshed out how you can walk into a store, and (through WeChat) the automated payment technology can [register](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2130062/tencent-beats-amazon-launch-unmanned-shop-lags-other-chinese-tech) what you pick up and charge it straight to your phone without you needing to talk to anyone or scan anything. What I haven't yet mentioned is Tencent's apps within apps. Tencent offers an in-app ""app store"", and they now offer [more apps or ""mini-apps"" than Apple's AppStore.](http://www.scmp.com/business/article/2129987/tencent-takes-aim-apple-and-google-app-stores-wechat-mini-program-push).

I would like to have some opinions or advice about my current portfolio. I am looking at holding about 2-4 years but don't actually need the money. I currently have $4000 invested and will invest $1000 more every month.

Portfolio:
CIB496: Technology Mutual Fund (+12%)

MIND: AI Run Equity Index Fund (-1%)

My current strategy is picking developing sectors and investing in funds who do the work for me. I am also picking conservative funds and will soon add one or two assymetric stocks for more risk.

Here are my ideas:
CYBR: Cyber Technology Index Fund
FPOCF: Nickel Mining Corporation in Canada
GSG: Commodity Index Fund
GBTC (Honestly probably not but we'll see)

I am not looking for get rich quick schemes but am willing to take on some long-term risk, I do not have time to day trade.

7,2018-01-08,GTCnews,1,WEEKLY OUTLOOK,"The global financial markets will focus on U.S. economic datas this week, including Friday's inflation report in the spotlight, and for further clues on the timing of the next FED rate hike.
China is to release monthly trade and inflation data, while the U.K., traders will be awaiting a report on manufacturing production for further indications on the continued effect of Brexit on the economy.
Quarterly earnings season kicks off with eight companies on the S&amp;P500 this week.


**TRUMP - THE NEXT MOVE**

Looking to boost domestic energy production, Friday the Trump administration has proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, including in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. That would reverse the Obama-era order placing 94% of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers.


**CRYPTO**

Prices retreated from last week’s record highs after Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges for cryptocurrencies said that it has not made a decision to add new currencies to its platform. This dried out recent speculation that it would include Ripple. Ripple now has a market cap of $130 billion, in second place behind Bitcoin. Ripple sells blockchain technology, powered by its own cryptocurrency XPR, to banks and payment providers and other financial institutions to speed up cross-border payments.


**GOOGLE’s CHINESE PRESENCE**

Google made an undisclosed deal in China on E-sport streaming, with gaming live-stream company Chushou. There are other investors as well. Chushou has around eight million streamers and 250.000 live streams per day. Google’s search engine is blocked in China and the tech giant has used investments as a way to broaden its presence in the market.  - Google took a minority stake in Chinese AI startup Mobvoi in 2015 during a $75 million fundraising round.


**GREED INDEED**

Verizon has pulled Bloomberg TV from its offerings for 4.6 million subscribers, after being asked to pay for the content. VZ's argument is that Bloomberg is making the content available to all consumers for free via web and mobile app, and that it shouldn't have to pay carriage fees.


**VW IS STILL THE BEST**

Volkswagen group sales rose to around 10.7 million cars last year, keeping the German behemoth ahead of its Japanese competition as the world's largest automaker. The report came as Ron Stach, senior vice president of sales at Volkswagen of America, left the company. U.S. sales rose 5.2% to 339,676 brand models last year but dropped 19% in December as the carmaker shifted focus to its homeland.


**TECHIES**

The tech industry's biggest conference - The CES -, this week from Tuesday to Friday. Speakers include Ford (F) CEO Jim Hackett, Verizon CTO (VZ) Hans Vestberg, Qualcomm (QCOM) President Christiano Amon, YouTube's (GOOGC) Robert Kyncl and Baidu COO (BIDU) Qi Lu. Talks and exhibitions will be on artificial intelligence, augmented reality, 4K TVs, robots and new drones, and these are just part of the buzz.

A monster week ahead of **Google, (NASDAQ:GOOG),** there is a lot more in it!

**Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)** is fighting $24.50 on the upside. - And $23.98 on the down. Who’ gonna win?

Shuffle your dividend growth, **3M Co. (NYSE:MMM)** is a must have!

**Gold (FX_IDC:XAUUSD)** had a good run, time for a reversal.


**FX WORLD**

Friday’s NFP has missed big time and our pairs reacted accordingly, or in cases not so subsequently. We are going to have an interesting week, with FED rate hike clues.

The **EURUSD** had a nice run on the NFP report but pulled back to 1.20, which seems to be the support at this point. The pair is still “fighting” 1.21 as it froze the market a bit, if we break it, 1.23 or even 1.25 is doable.

The **GBPUSD** also rallied and turned to the downside. Above 1.365 would mean that we closed a massive gap below and could offer a buy and hold market. Until then just buy the dips, as 1.3333 is the floor.

The **USDJPY** has bounced on Friday, which is interesting since the jobs report numbers missed significantly. This shows that the market is interested to go 115 and beyond. Until we break above, use the dips for entries.

8,2018-01-05,TrueGritLook,1,Advice on Tech ETFs,"Hey all, I'm looking for advice on some tech ETFs. My portfolio is about 53K in a four part portfolio of 70% in VTSAX (with a little in VGTSX for international exposure) and 30% in VBTLX (with a little in VTIBX for international exposure).

I'm going to contribute another 10k, but was thinking of investing in some more niche ETFs. Right now, my list of possibilities is...

IHI: Medical devices
BOTZ: AI
SNSR: Internet of Things
ARK (either ARKK, ARKG, or ARKQ)

General advice on these? Or should I instead invest in a larger tech ETF like XLK or VGT?

In terms of myself, I'm in a career making 70k and will get a large salary increase in 2.5 years, so this is long term investing but with the expectation that I will contribute much more to my VTSAX/VBTLX in the future.

Thanks!!"

At some point they said, ""this is as good as it gets,"" and all of the new people were creating would lead to sin/gluttony. They are betting on a God correction to reset everything in the afterlife and they will be the only ones with enough virtue capital to get in at the bottom... in heaven.

Does that make sense?

It's terribly hard to imagine the world doing fine with the invention of AI, for us. Does that mean people should short the market when AI comes out because it's scary and it's going to lead to the world ending? Would it be a good idea to pile it all into gold then because the AI can steal digital money? Probably not, people are pretty good at handling catastrophe before it happens.

10,2018-02-25,newdaynewuser,530,Finding investing trends before they become mainstream,"Hi All

Between 2015 and 2017 I managed to find some really good investment (gambling would be a better word maybe) possibilities just by lurking a well known anonymous board called /biz/ and reading some news.  

Some of them include:


* lithium etf: NYSEARCA: LIT in 2016 January, some lithium companies were mentioned end of 2015 like ASX: GXY which had made really nice returns.
 

* Marihuana legalization in Canada: various small companies were mentioned back in 2016, most of them have made 800 - 1000% returns since then.


* NVIDIA: 
Nvidia Cards being used for:
 - Monte carlo simulations (banking Products)
 - AI / Self driving cars
 - Crypto mining

I knew that NVIDIA is a nice gamble back in March 2016


* Crypto: Got into crypto in 2014 with a very low ammount of money as I thought on it as pure gamble


My problem this year is that I do not seem to find similar possibilities like I found 1-2 years ago. It is mostly because the board I used to lurk got filled with scammers advertising some useless cryptocoin so basically the intelligent people left that board. 

I am looking now for any other source / forum / board / people whatever to be informed early about possibilities like the ones I mentioned above. I do not care about short term gains or options or anything WSB related. 

So I made this topic to:
 
* Discuss if there is anything that is not mainstream yet, Institutional Investors have not discovered, or do not believe in it

* Find people who have the same interest as me and know that this is basically not investing but more gambling

* Find some future ""megatrends"" which are already covered by ETFs but not well known yet 

In case I made the topic in the wrong forum I would be happy if someone points me to the right forum. 
In case the name of the board is not allowed to be mentioned here I can remove it of course

/edit: To give you an idea what I am going to research now is as follows: 
I have heard that if a drug company passes the phase 2 test for its newest product then there is a high chance (60% ?) that the phase 3 test will also be passed. I am trying to find out how the price of such companies changes after a successful phase 2 test and whether there is really a high chance for the phase 3 test to be successful. Also what kind of drugs are seen as very positive by the market.

Wow the topic got really popular, so some quick rules:

* Please do not mention anything related to insider trading here, I am not interested in it as it is illegal

* Also do not mention any specific cryptocoins here, that is no the goal of the topic

As someone who had stocks pre -97, -01, -08 and mostly got lucky (not what I said at the time) I can’t help but believe that every real (obvious) arbitrage opportunity, even if it only works 50+% of the time, has been discovered and exploited by math geeks and statisticians. Anything now left is being found faster than we can understand thanks to AI in combination with their access to decades long second by second data.

19,2018-02-09,warrenfgerald,2,Economic headwinds nobody seems to be talking about,"When markets make a dramatic turn many people attempt to lay blame on the most contemporaneous events (inflation, interest rates, etc...), however I would make the case that many investors are often looking much further down the road towards economic headwinds that could impact real returns of equities over the long run (5-10 years). With that in mind I believe the following headwinds could be the underlying reason for a widespread selloff...

1. Automation - This would include autonomous vehicles, AI, Amazon grocery stores with no cashiers, etc.... Machines have been slowly taking over jobs for years, but it seems like this trend is about to reach escape velocity. Just this week it was reported that an autonomous Semi completed a coast to coast trip across America. Uber is slowly rolling out driverless cars. Etc... Stuff like this is a game changer for our economy. 

2. The widening wealth gap - Just like automation, this trend seems to be increasing at an alarming rate. I can't imagine it is good for an economy to have so few individuals earning such a high percentage of the economic output and controlling such a large portion of the nation's wealth. 

3. The Debt and Deficit - Another item trending in the wrong direction. When Obama took office the annual deficit was around $1 trillion, by the time he left office that figure had been reduced to around $600 billion. This figure is projected to start increasing again, most likely hitting the $1 trillion/year mark soon. We are now above $20 trillion on total federal debt. The interest payments on all this debt is going to start becoming a much larger piece of the federal expense pie. This is not good when we have major structural issues like Social Security, Medicare, Medicade, and a crumbling infrastructure. 

What makes these three issues most concerning is that there doesn't seem to be anyone in Washington with the courage to address any of them. Current priorities in Congress appear to be cutting taxes, spending more on the military, and helping a small group of young people who are not even US citizens. All three could be worthy pursuits depending on your perspective, but are these really the most dire issues facing the country? When was the last time a politician proposed ideas to balance the budget, address the wealth gap, or deal with automation?  These are topics that only get discussed in dark corners of the internet. Maybe this lack of seriousness is why the markets are taking a breather? 

Edit - [the Feds are scheduled to borrow $1trillion this year. Almost double the deficit of 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/03/the-u-s-government-is-set-to-borrow-nearly-1-trillion-this-year/?utm_term=.8d9607c9024c). "

Yet fully 61 percent of these same professionals acknowledge they have done little to prepare for the coming of the world’s biggest privacy regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. What’s more, 99 percent admit to needing additional help in preparing for the GDPR.

""With over 400 entries in more than 70 categories, the 2018 awards are highly competitive and all winners truly reflect the very best in today's cybersecurity industry."" 

“We have worked very hard on our GDPR functions – adding capabilities that are grounded in true use cases and deliver immediate value to the client. Our forthcoming GDPREngine technology delivered in a SaaS model delivers GDPR compliance capabilities faster and with much less total cost of ownership for clients,” added Mr. Remillard. “We will be making this officially available for beta clients in the coming month – the GDPR Deadline is fast approaching – 100 days exactly today. We are seeing increased demand worldwide for capabilities – matching our initial analysis that GDPR applies more broadly than just the European Union.”

3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR’s requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies – those with greater than $500 million in revenues – say they will hire a consulting firm.

4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe’s New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

“Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. “G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.” 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR – new rules, wider reach – the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the “most ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era” – and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

I am not by any means saying Metlife, Allstate and TD Ameritrade will be ClassiDocs customers, however I am saying that when they look for GDPR, they will go to N8 Identity for help. ClassiDocs may not get chosen but it will have potential access to thousands of businesses.

28,2018-03-06,KarmaKingKong,2,Thoughts on Equbot?,Its said to be an AI thats beating the market. What are your thoughts?
29,2018-03-06,predictionmonk,1,"price prediction (QQQ) for tomorrow (March 6, 2018)","I built an AI-lite model to predict the daily price performance of the QQQ (tracking Nasdaq-100). It should work about two-thirds of the time.  
Feel free to check the performance tomorrow and let me know your thoughts:

&amp;nbsp;

price prediction (QQQ) for tomorrow (March 6, 2018): the day should open and close flattish, but the market should have a negative tendency during the day. For example, one possibility is that the market opens flat or slightly higher, stays red for the day, and resurfaces to the black at the close. Constant zig-zagging during the day is another possibility. *Bullishness is not anticipated.*  

open:	167.88-167.94  
high:	160.58-165.34  
low:	162.31-164.44  
close:	167.91-168.02  

(Keep in mind Monday's close was 167.83)  

Note: the ranges above may occasionally show some incoherence. For example, the open range may sometimes be higher than the high range. In those cases, I interpret the highs to apply after the open itself. (A similar thing applies to closing-price ranges). You should still be able to draw a general picture from looking at all the ranges in conjunction.  

Hope this helps you. You can catch me at @predictionmonk in Twitter if interested in seeing past predictions."
30,2018-03-06,TimLEarn,0,ROBO vs BOTZ?,Which one would you go for considering an optimism on AI/Robotics in the future?
31,2018-03-05,Noqt,314,"Long $NVDA, involvement in AI will bring success for them long term","$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model, paper, and open position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.


* Cryptocurrency becoming more popular. Crypto isn't going away, so I'd assume it to be a catalyst. I don't like to pay attention to it. 


* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


* Gaming industry big news (PC). Every year there is more gamers, every year gamers get better jobs, every year there are more games. GPUs are an integral part to gaming, so these revenues will grow with the gaming market.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


* New GeForce 20 series being not much of an upgrade from series 10, possibility but I think unlikely. Unlikely because their Titan V uses 12nm technology.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity. 


Why am I doing this?


Well I don't think I am perfect and I think I missed A LOT, so I want some critisism to get as close to perfection as I can. Read the paper and look at the model.

Feel free to check the performance tomorrow and let me know your thoughts:  
price prediction (QQQ) for tomorrow (March 2, 2018): the market should open flat or very slightly higher, but it should drub the lows for the rest of the day. However, it should recover and again end flat or very slightly higher.

low:	159.18-161.16

33,2018-04-25,LordOfNightsong,2,S&amp;P500 Etf vs Stocks,"I'm creeping into the investing area. I tried my hand at crypto (yeah I know) with only a thousand or so. Made a little. Paid taxes. And all in all didn't gain much. What I did gain though, an understanding that I enjoyed looking at graph trends, researching options, and putting money on the line.

I want that to transition into investing as a more practical hobby. I've lurked on here, wsb, stocks, personal finance, etc. I opened a Roth Ira for the long haul and to put off the taxes until then. I'm starting with about 2500. From what I've read, an S&amp;P500 indexed etf seems to be what people recommend. I'm curious as to whether or not people think stocks might be a better option. 

I'm interested in stocks because that's an exposure I don't have within my roth 401k. Currently in my Roth 401k, I contribute 10% and am matched 6%. I have it diversified aggressively at 13% S&amp;P500 indexed, 13% large cap growth, 12% S&amp;P500 mid cap indexed, 12% Russell small cap indexed, 14% international index, 3% company stock, 15% emerging market equities, and 18% nasdaq 100 indexed. 

So due to me already being weighted 13% of my Roth 401k towards an S&amp;P500 index, I'm inclined to not go in the direction of the frequent advice I see. What I am leaning towards is AI. I'm looking at TCEHY and MSFT. Both said they were committing to AI. Might be 2 of the best non processor stocks that aren't GOOG or AMZN. Thoughts anyone? Should I be doing something else? 

About me. 26. 55k year salary plus bonuses. Promotion to 64k within year (obviously not gauranteed). 15k student loan debt. 10k auto loan debt. Starting a rent to own situation with fiance. 1000 a month with 250 of each payment going towards down payment. "

Baby boomers are retiring in astonishing numbers and pulling out large sums of money. You also have big money managers who are removing their equity from standard blue chips and moving their money to healthcare (Buffett, Bezos and Diamon) or smarter investments like clean energy, blockchain or AI. This downtrend I believe will continue throughout the year. "

37,2018-04-17,sfriendlydragon,0,self-driving car ideas,"SDCs (Self-Driving Cars) will have profound impacts on many different markets over the next 2 decades. Additionally, SDTs (Self-Driving Trucks) will disrupt the $100b/year trucking and logistics industry. 

Some shifts to expect in the next 20 years:
- Software platforms for personal transportation, provided by SDCs (think Uber without the driver)
- These software platforms will operate and maintain fleets of SDCs
- When you don't need to pay a driver for driving, the variable cost of each ride is dramatically reduced
- If fleets are electric, variable cost of each ride is further reduced due to decreasing cost of electricity production
- Private car ownership becomes uneconomical (it will be like owning a horse today - mainly limited to 1. rural usage where fleet operation is unprofitable 2. quaint hobby for wealthy individuals that want the experience of ""driving"")
- Reduced private car ownership means lower demand for car services (mechanics, paint shops, tire shops, oil shops, etc.)
- Trucking and logistics companies must move to utilize new STRs, or be undercut by competition
- SDTs dramatically reduce employment of human truckers (1mm truckers out of work)
- No human truckers mean lower revenue for convenience stores that service truckers.

Here are some ideas of how to gain exposure to this revolution.


Companies leading the charge (doing live testing of SDCs):
- Cruise Automation (GM)
- Waymo (Alphabet)
- Uber (private)


Companies developing self-driving trucks:
- Tesla
- Otto (Uber, private)


Companies developing SDCs:
- Ford
- Toyota
- Daimler
- Volkswagon
- BMW


Technologies around SDCs
- batteries - Tesla
- software - Waymo (Alphabet), 
- hardware - Nvidia (AI processors), Bosch (sensors)
- charging stations - Tesla, Car Charging Group
- solar panels - (Automated fleet likely to be fully electric)


Industries to short:
- Old school style trucking companies (small carriers will be wiped out by low operating cost of self-driving trucks)
- things around individual car ownership - car accessories
- mechanics or other car service shops (SDRs are likely to be fleet operated and serviced by the companies that own them)
- truck stops / convenience stores that service long haul truckers (No customers if all trucks are self-driven)
- old school taxi companies (Already feeling huge pressure from Uber/Lyft)

38,2018-04-13,haxamin,6,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

“Think of strategic investments and M&amp;A as playing a game of go,” said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. “In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent.”"
39,2018-04-12,sasksean,46,On Micron and why the memory market is not cyclical anymore.,"Every GPU sold requires huge quantities of expensive RAM and availability of that RAM is what determines how many chips Nvidia or AMD can sell. Somehow Nvidia warrants a P/E ratio of 50 but Micron only a 5 even though Nvidia is the one holding it's bowl out at the doorstep of the memory fabs.

Memory is baked into so many products now that the market demand is nearly in crisis. Tensor cores, video surveillance, portable VR, autonomous machines, crypto-currency... memory is a commodity that is suddenly found to be so much more ubiquitous than it used to be. Historic trends of even two years ago have no relevance anymore.

There is also an AI cold war brewing and Micron is the only large US based manufacturer of memory. The US government will not allow it to fail. China can't afford to tariff Micron either because they have no domestic fabs and want all the AI resources they can buy. They are desperate to get their own production online but that will take years and the AI supremacy war will be in full swing by then. China will consume all the resources it can manufacture and would be reluctant to allow it's foundries to fuel foreign AI regardless.

There will be an explosion of demand in the next five years and the projected supply increase will not be able to keep up.

The current value of Micron has an assumption that the price of RAM will crash already baked in. If it doesn't crash, the current valuation of the company is low by a magnitude. It's absurd. I'm growing suspicious of anyone bearish on Micron as being part of a propaganda machine."

Before this post is downvoted for the mention of an expense ratio over 10bps, I don't think it is fair to compare to broad index ETF ERs like VTI's 4bps when a specialized ETF will be a minor holding in a passive portfolio mostly comprised of VTSAX/VTIAX. The 1-2% position (with a couple other ETFs like this, i.e. ITA, IBB, IHI, ROBO) adds a little spice to my passive portfolio.

https://twitter.com/predictionmonk/status/982460135011377153

price prediction (QQQ) for Tuesday (April 10, 2018): the forecast is for a partly cloudy day, with no clear direction either way. I know, anti-climactic.

Tuesday is highly unlikely to open flat, with some indication of flatness and/or bearishness. The primary model has recused itself, being hesitant of the opening. However, the secondary model is very skeptical about a bullish open. So, by process of elimination, expect fair chance of a flat or bearish open.

As to the market highs and lows, the primary model expects the median predictions to be flat all around. Note that the range for the high is wider than the low - which introduces more uncertainty about where the high will be. But the low shows a clearer picture; it apparently won't be in freefall. This kind of finding should frustrate both fanatic bulls and bears.

The secondary model further highlights the same picture: it is barely skeptical of a bullish high, but very skeptical of a bearish low. Again, we are seeing the hallmarks of a partly cloudy day: no bright sun, but no thunder either.

Finally, as to the close, the first model firmly says it won't be flat. The secondary model again is so doubtful about any direction, even a flat close. So, this is one day where the final outcome is somewhat up for grabs, epistemologically speaking. But remember the high and lows strongly suggest a day of range movement. And, note that exogenous events can derail this forecast.

Notes:

Friday met three of the four ranges predicted a day ago!

https://twitter.com/predictionmonk/status/982352482704637952

&amp;nbsp;

price prediction (QQQ) for Monday (April 9, 2018): the forecast is turning sunnier - either partly or fully. This prediction was generated two days ago. Full details are here:

https://twitter.com/predictionmonk/status/982460116527009793

The general pictures includes the below, though:

Monday is highly unlikely to open flat, with no clear indication as to initial bullishness or bearishness.

As to the market highs and lows, the primary model expects the median predictions to be bullish and flat, respectively. This is good for bulls, not bad. The interval predictions show a similar picture, with the most bearish outcomes being around $155 for both the high and low. This suggests that $155 is a probable deep bottom for Monday. The secondary model confirms a bullish high, but also contradicts a bullish low - so the idea of a flattish low gains credence. At any rate, you may have some deambulations around the predicted figures, so focus more on the overall picture, which is bullish.

Finally, the close is less predictable. The first model simply says it won't be flat, and is fairly certain of that. The secondary model is so doubtful about either direction, but agrees on a low probability of a flat close. So, whatever happens on Monday, it seems that flatness won't be the end scenario."

&amp;nbsp;

price prediction (QQQ) for Monday (April 9, 2018): the forecast is turning sunnier - either partly or fully. Mind you, this forecast excludes the role of exogenous events. These are events that fall outside the model's scope and can influence the outcome in a significant way. Examples are, oh I don't know, $100 BILLION of new tariffs against China threatened after hours. (This happened last night, although the model still held together 3 out of the 4 predicted ranges).

Monday is highly unlikely to open flat, with no clear indication as to initial bullishness or bearishness. The primary model ever so slightly hints at a non-bullish open, while the secondary model is straight-up skeptical about a flat open. Overall, expect a non-flat open, and just perhaps a bearish one.

As to the market highs and lows, the primary model expects the median predictions to be bullish and flat, respectively. This is good for bulls, not bad.

This forecast is not as complex as the two previous ones. The picture is less cloudy, and more sunny. I still emphasize the risk posed by exogenous events, since we have a native-lobotomee at the helm of the government, and so it is possible to have wicked crazy events that derail everything. But, if things are relatively even-tempered, and news are within their usual range of outcomes (even for 2017-2018), then the prediction above should hold.

2- By proximity, Japan will be one of the main trade partners in sectors such as robotics for China, that's at the same time developing its market in that sector as the country sees robotics and AI as an strategic sector: https://www.export.gov/article?id=China-Machinery

3- By affinity, US will look to Canada, Japan and the EU in order to import some kind of products due to the Chinese trade war.

4- The bans will mostly affect (imho), the industrial sector, and mostly, those in the high tech.

So, now I'm looking for the best option. I tought about a long in those whole markets (EU and Japan industrials), but I think that'll be better to refine the bet. Then I took a look to the 'ROBO' etf, but it has a ~40% in the US.

49,2018-05-29,Wighnut,21,"Why can no one else use Amazons ""no profit"" strategy","OK, so obviously Amazon shareholders are happy with Amazon basically not declaring profits because they trust Bezos to basically lead Amazon to monopolistic dominance in x years. How did this work in the beginning, when it wasn't immediately clear that Amazon would be as dominating as it is now. I understand that retail/e\-commerce is a low margin industry.

Let's take a competitor for example. Alphabet has the most ridiculous profit margins. It's just the nature of the online ad business and Google's dominance of it. Google is getting into e\-commerce more and more \(Express and Shopping\) but as said, this is a low margin industry. So Google has less to gain in terms of profit than Amazon has to gain from getting into the ad business in turn.

But why are shareholders making such a fuss when Alphabet sees rising costs? Obviously they're gonna invest tens of billions into Cloud Platform and especially AI \(differentiating factor\), because they have to. They can't let Amazon continue to dominate with AWS. Is this just good old short term thinking on the investors part. Because it seems to me that in tech, and especially and the level of AMZN, MSFT, GOOG it's all about capturing the market and having the dominant \(or at least competitive\) platform with the most engagement and developer activity.

What do you think\`?"
50,2018-05-26,fullmetaleng,0,"AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, Google and FB","AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, Google and FB are the 5 largest companies in S&amp;P 500.

Can we discuss about these companies for a bit, to see which ones of these are poised to grow further and which ones are likely to go down in the next 5 years?

My thoughts -

AMZN:
Out of the 5, I think Amazon's stock is poised to grow further, because they seem to be doing a lot of things and doing them well.

Online retail - Amazon is unquestionably the leader in this category, in the USA.
Media and Entertainment - Prime Video, Twitch, TNF.
Devices - FireTV, FireTablet, Echo, Kindle.
Technology - AWS is an undisputed leader in this category.

And I can't think of any company posing a threat to Amazon's position in any of these areas, expect for GoogleHome overtaking Echo devices, but even if that happens, I see Amazon and Google having an equal share in the market.

AAPL/Google/FB:

After AMZN, I am not sure which company can be in the 2nd position. It could be AAPL or Google depending on how they execute some of their projects.

Google seems to be not very focused at the moment, with them letting Amazon get ahead in AI devices, which I consider to be Google's home turf. 
Also, GoogleCloud doesn't seem to be picking up market share, which again appears to be lack of focus to me.
What seems to be going well for them though is Youtube and the products that they are launching on the Youtube platform (Youtube Ads and Youtube TV)

Apple seems to have lost steam in terms of innovative products. 
In recent years, their experiments with iPhone models didn't click very well (iPhone 5C and iPhone X) and their Home Speaker is much behind of Echo and GoogleHomes, primarily due to Siri being inferior in capabilities compared to Alexa and Google.
However, they are building a powerful ecosystem around their products with AppStore, AppleMusic, AppleWatch etc. I am actually surprised by how many people are buying an AppleWatch, it probably falls into a luxury good category. 

While I don't think FB and it's products have long term value, since  younger kids usually steer away from the communication channels of older generations (well, is that a surprise?) and it is not very hard for someone to come up with yet another app that lets people stay in touch with each other.
However, since the timeline I am thinking here is the next 5 years, I think FB also has a lot of room to grow especially through advertisements on Instagram platform. And if the can build a good product around Videos, it will give a strong competition to Youtube.

MSFT:

Out of the 5 companies, I think MSFT is the most likely to lag behind the others.

MSFT has products in both Enterprise and consumer space.
In the last 7 years Office365 seems to be the only product from Product that became a runaway success. But, it is no small feat, providing the productivity suite for the entire world is serious business and generates a lot of money. However, Azure seems to be way behind AWS, and the story isn't going to change anytime soon. However, even the distant 2nd position in cloud means serious money.

But, on consumer side, the picture doesn't look good at all. In the last 10 years, Microsoft's foray into consumer space hasn't resulted in positive results at all. WindowsPhone, Windows8, Windows10, Kinect and WindowsStore haven't performed well at all. The surface products have gotten great reviews, but the adoption seems low overall."

Still, it is sensible to strictly consider this forecast to be neutral\-to\-bullish, and to consider the bullish scenario as likely \(if not more\) than the neutral one. Bulls can join the market. Bears should stay far away.

54,2018-05-21,QuantalyticsResearch,2,Attractiveness in Baidu Sell-Off,"BIDU is down 15.4%, or 100% on an annualized basis following the news that its Chief Operating Officer Qi Liu, will be departing the firm due to personal reasons. BIDU is currently trading at USD$ 240 a level not seen since the end of March. The main concern is that the firm’s transformation into an AI-focused company may slow down. 

Investors need to question whether the company is truly worth 15% less today than it was just last week. For investors who believe in the company’s ability to restructure their management and hit their long term strategic goals, a “buy the dip” opportunity certainly seems attractive.

With the stock holding the 200-Day moving average at 240 today, a June 29 expiry for a 225/242.50/252.5 call spread collar for a $.45 credit may be worth a look"

NVID - 3%
AAPL - 7%
AMAZ - 7%
GOOG - 18%

I have been holding some GOOG shares since it was at ~840 and yesterday I added 6 more. 

I am not good at evaluating companies but when I look around GOOG is slowly taking over and there is still so much potential growth. 

1). Data - Google has so much data. It is INSANE. They know about billions of humans and their behavior, business, streets, pictures (with google photos) It is absolutely nuts. which brings me to my next two point (AI and Cars)

2). AI - we know that AI is going to be a huge part of our everyday life going forward. And with the amount of data GOOGLE has, they are on the TOP spot to leverage and make their AI the best. This isn't even an opinion right? FB, Microsoft, and Amazon doesn't even have fraction of data that Google has. And AI is all about machine learning, and the more data you feed, smarter it gets. 

3). Automobile- This is uncharted territory, no one has been able to penetrate and challenge the big car giants like GM, Toyota, Audi etc. Once Elon Musk was asked a question, who does he see as his competitor and his answer was Apple. I don't know if he was being ignorant or genuinely don't see Google as a major competitor.    

Google's approach to automobile is same as their approach to Android. They do what they do the best (create software and services) and let the hardware people make the hardware. Seems like they are on the same path with cars, they are creating the best selfdriving system and infrastructure and just going to sell this to other car manufactures, who already know how to build cars. And just like Pixel line up, we might see cars made by Google at some point. But the point is, how can anyone not see Google as a serious competitor is beyond my understanding. 

I still haven't talked about their new silicon initiative and IoT stuff. Its safe to say, it all looks very promising to me

What do you guys think about Google in general? Positive, negative or neutral?"

The platform will serve both amateurs and betting professionals in a unified ecosystem based on the blockchain with all its associated advantages: decentralization, reliability, transparency, scalability and unprecedented performance.**

&gt;*“The online betting market is on the threshold of tectonic change. Blockchain will revolutionize the industry, significantly expanding the user base by ushering in new standards for functionality and reliability that will radically change the way individuals interact with each other. The Bettium platform will present a cleaner, more responsible alternative to the traditional bookmaker, fundamentally altering perceptions of sports betting and encouraging wider participation from the community as a whole: bettors, players, advertisers and industry professionals. We intend to show the positive side of the betting industry, providing tools and algorithms that will allow even amateur bettors the chance to play like the experts. Betting today stands at the intersection of sports, technology and logic — and Bettium is the key,”* *says Alan Hunt, Bettium CEO.*

**Bettium** will truly level the playing field between professionals and amateurs by providing all users with equal capabilities and the same professional-grade tools, such as the platform’s built-in AI assistant (nicknamed “Merlin”), which will not only process Big Data and help users make educated decisions, but also allow to automatically execute their own betting strategies. Those who prefer to rely on the expertise of professionals will be able to subscribe to expert forecasts, mimicking their bets or even completely entrusting wagers to a fund manager for a small fee. The transparency and security of such relationships will be guaranteed by smart contracts and facilitated with a rating system allowing users to assess expert capabilities.

The project expects to capture a significant share of the online betting market, which has more than doubled over the past decade and is projected to reach US$52 billion in 2018. Bettium will help transform the industry from of loose collection of semi-respectable and unregulated bookmakers to an established institution with functionality that ensures safety and transparency for the common bettor. Blockchain technology and smart contracts will be used for deposits, payouts, transactions and risk coverage, eliminating the pitfalls of traditional systems, such as lack of transparency, technical vulnerability, excessive fees, low bet limits and high deposit requirements. Change is inevitable in today’s market and Bettium will be at the forefront.

Bettium team has already announced the details of its public crowdsale. The **pre-sale** of BETT tokens is to begin on **July 1**, and the open phase of the crowdsale on July 10, 2018. Currently, the company is conducting a private sale. **A total of 1,000,000,000 BETT tokens will issued with 600,000,000 offered in the tokensale. The company anticipates it will raise up to US$30 mln in the token offering.**"

75,2018-06-07,pleg910,9,What’s your take on the current state of chips? Here’s mine.,"I’m just going to focus on popular reddit chip stocks because I think as a group they paint a pretty good picture of the landscape. Obviously between Micron, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel there’s been a huge rally in the past month, but the outlook since the beginning of June seems to have shifted. Here’s what I’ve gathered from reports:

**Intel** has by far the highest market cap and is the most established, but, especially after the AMD showing of 7nm chips yesterday, it’s facing serious competition and looks to be falling behind. That said, they’ve been “falling behind” for a while now and they still consistently blowout earnings. Like Apple, even when they aren’t executing perfectly, they’re such a mainstay that it doesn’t usually show much in quarterly results.

**Micron** suffered a hit from a couple analyst downgrades last week, and is under investigation. Any sign of a slowdown in dram prices will send it back to the 40s and I’m worried it’s just gonna keep bouncing off 60 and then dump with people taking profits before the earnings report in a couple weeks. Still, the majority of analysts like it a lot. Like...a lot a lot. 

**Nvidia** announced that it will be a while before new gaming chips are produced, but also they’re best positioned to benefit from AI and cloud computing. The stock is very expensive. 

**AMD** is undervalued, but their stock price is historically fickle and they just had a huge run-up. I wish I had some and feel that it’s too late to buy after today since I’m thinking short term (6 months-year). 

**All chip companies** are at risk of being used as a bartering tool in the USA/China tariff negotiations, which puts them in a potentially precarious position. This could be the reason Micron and others are under investigation by China (leverage). 

All in all, I’m scared and am considering decreasing my large position in Micron. If I had AMD I’d keep that one. I’m keeping Nvidia. I dumped Intel in favor of micron and Nvidia a couple weeks ago (a little late to the party) because they have more room to grow and I suspect intel’s technology falling behind will catch up with them soon.

What’s your take? I obsessively read reports, but I’m not in the industry or anything. I’d appreciate any info/opinions/advice you’d be willing to pass on. "

I'm not trying to get rich or live off the stock market, but I do like the idea of periodically investing some money and maybe I'll get something out of it in the long run. 

Basically some of my friends got Robinhood (which seems like a neat app, but if anyone knows something I don't let me know before I get my identity stolen) and convinced me to join in for the free stock and now I have a stock in something called Zynga and $5 in dogecoins.

I'm personally studying IT and AI, so these are the areas I'm most knowledgeable about and probably where I'll do most of my investing. However I've yet to do any classes on economics to prepare myself for how to predict trends, and especially what different terms mean.

So I guess my questions are: What do I need to know to start some long term small investments? Is it even worth it if I'm not investing &gt;$1000? And what are some example stocks that I can get for my current buying power, as most stocks I've found for &lt;$100 haven't changed by more than like $2 in the last five years (which would probably be great if I could buy thousands of them), should I wait for more spending power and buy then or is investing \~$50 every couple of months acceptable?"

**Google:** Seems to be doing some fascinating things in AI. They have multiple self contained teams fully focusing on AI such as DeepMind and Brain. When looking at Google it even seems that building better AI's has been a fundamental goal ever since the company was founded. Recent advances in speech recognition and other areas prove that Google is at the very forefront of this technology and given its multifaceted approach to development it is likely Google will be  able to found many uses for their AI tech.

**Amazon:** On the other hand look like they are increasingly winning the global battle for retail, IT infrastructure and increasingly consumer electronics (Alexa, Kindle, Fire TV). These markets are gigantic and if Amazon really does cement a dominant and lasting lead in 2 of 3, areas mentioned above, then surely it will continue to grow into the future.

What do you guys think? Do you agree?

I wonder if my weed stocks should be allocated higher, but I already have bigger positions on them in my taxable accounts. 

So far my best performers have been the individual stock picks -- AMD, Amazon, Shopify, Nvidia.

I feel like I'm young enough still to experiment a little bit in the Roth, but I'm wondering if maybe I'm making too many mistakes.

95,2018-08-28,seekingtheta_shoes,10,Let's talk about the underdog: TSMC,"TSMC has a monopoly on 7 nanometer from Apple (75% of 7nm orders), AMD (cpu, gpu?), NVDA (post-volta/turing), and now qualcomm (snapdragon). With growing demand from other sources besides mobile and the expectation that NAND/DRAM ASPs will cool, I think they will set their sights on increasing profit margins. Their margins have in the past been contracting due to capex for 5-nanometer and crypto headwinds. 

It has also been reported that TSMC has the highest yield/quality 7 nanometer node as compared to the rivals: Intel and Samsung. Intel's 10 nanometer (equivalent to ITRS 7 nanometer) is rumored to be delayed another year. Apple will continue to use TSMC as Intel doesn't have mobile nodes (low power and leakage), and Samsung already supplies a $ of BOM including OLED and memory to Apple. 

In the AI space, TSMC is fabricating Graphcore's giant AI accelerator, which replaces DRAM with on-chip SRAM. IN my mind, this is the strongest competitor of NVDA. This is because AI perf depends strongly on the memory due to IO-bound nature of DL training. 

Conclusion: 
TSMC has a growing monopoly over mobile (virtually all non-Samsung phones), AI (NVDA and Graphcore). And now TSMC will enter the server market through AMD. 

In my semi pick, I am super bullish on TSMC and slightly bullish on AMD + NVDA. Short NAND makers.

98,2018-08-27,WaveML,131,"Where's the ""moat"" or value for companies like Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab? Aren't they essentially worthless? What am I missing here?","**TLDR: Ridesharing companies' massive valuations are based off of a driverless taxi future. However, it seems that in this future almost all the profits will go to the companies that have solved the hard tasks of manufacturing the cars and designing the self driving AI software, not the relatively easy to replicate task of building the app that customers use to order the taxis. What am I missing?**

In light of the Uber IPO next year I've been thinking about the multi billion valuations for ridesharing companies like Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab.

As far as I can see, their perceived value comes from driverless cars. The idea is that in the future many people won't even own a car, they will just call up a driverless taxi when they want to go somewhere (the combination of no drivers' salaries and the fact that cars being able to drive 24/7 will reduce the number of cars that need to be bought will make the taxi services cheaper than owning your own car). Ridesharing companies, as the tools with which customers call their robo-taxis, will hence get a big slice of this multi-trillion dollar market.

However, I can't understand why these ridesharing companies get a place in this driverless future at all. As far as I can see, we can break down the driverless taxi service into three components:

* **Manufacturing the actual physical cars.** This is a very difficult engineering challenge; it requires both great industry knowledge and a large number of factories. This ""moat"" makes it hard for someone to just come in and start their own car manufacturing company, which in turn ensures that the company can have a decent markup/profit on their cars.
* **Designing the AI software that drives the cars.** Again, this is a very hard engineering challenge which ensures that there's a ""moat"" that stops competitors and hence safeguards profits.
* **Building the app that people use to call up the taxi.** I'm not saying this task is entirely trivial, but (speaking as someone who works in tech/AI) it's not that hard for a reasonably large tech company to quickly make a reasonable looking app that lets users order a taxi, and it's definitely nowhere near as hard as the first two. As far as I can see, there's very little ""moat"" here, anyone can easily move into this area, which means that there's very little profit available in just running the app that people use to contact the cars.

As far as I can see, if driverless cars become feasible/reliable, then it's very likely that the companies with the driverless AI software will just buy cars (or partner with car manufacturing companies) and launch their own taxi service because there's no way that they're going to let Uber/Lyft/DiDi/Grab act as a middleman and keep a big slice of the profits. I suppose that the existing ridesharing companies could stay in business by cutting prices until they're only marginally higher than the cost of cars+driverless software, but then they're not gonna make much profit and hence don't justify their current massive vaulations.

I've seen a couple of counterarguments to this, but they don't make sense to me:

* **The ridesharing companies can build/are building their own driverless car technology.** Firstly, driverless car technology is extremely difficult, and from what I've read, companies like Uber are well behind the industry leaders like Google's Waymo and GM Cruise. Furthermore, I don't see why starting work on driverless cars (or claiming you can make them in the future) justifies the huge valuations that ridesharing companies currently have; surely it makes more sense to give a large valuation to the startups that have made the most progress in driverless cars (the technology that's hard to replicate) rather than the startups which have so far only proved that they can build a taxi app (the technology that's very easy to replicate).
* **The network effect/brand loyalty.** From what I can tell, this just doesn't really apply much to taxi services. All the available evidence has shown that consumers pick the cheapest service that  can keep waiting times below 3 minutes (i.e. there's no extra network effect once your company has a certain number of cars in a given city). If I recall correctly the driver's salary is about 85% the cost of a taxi ride; while ridesharing companies can cut this cost a bit, the reality is that a company with good driverless car tech could easily undercut ridesharing companies by a ridiculous margin while still remaining profitable. In terms of reaching the number of cars needed to keep waiting times below 3 minutes, a large company like Google can just buy the cars needed to achieve this in a given city, take over the market in that city, and then move onto the next one (this is a bit different to something like Facebook where there's a global network that is harder to disrupt unless you can convince a large number of people all over the world to move to your service at the same time).

Of course, there's a reasonable chance that driverless cars will prove to be infeasible with current technology. But then the main ""nobody will own their own car any more"" value proposition for these companies is gone. And furthermore, due to the lack of proper network effects that I mentioned earlier, it's unlikely that these companies will be able to make much profit at all (since someone else will come in the moment that they try to jack up prices). Hence again I can't see why these companies have such high valuations.

What am I missing here? Why are the valuations for these companies so high?"
99,2018-08-26,AnalystWynalyst,12,Billionaire Howard Marks: Computers won't put the best human investors out of business.,"What's your thoughts on this? Machine learning and AI  would absolutely have impact on headcount reduction at a lower level. ER will see a significant impact of this trend as jobs for pattern recognition and data cleaning will no longer require an analyst. 

\-----

Howard Marks believes top investors can still thrive even as trading machines become more active in the financial markets.

""Computers can do an unmatched job dealing with the things that can be counted: things that are quantitative and objective. But many other things — qualitative, subjective things — count for a great deal, and I doubt computers can do what the best investors do,"" Marks said Monday in a note to clients entitled ""Investing Without People.""

Marks, whose firm, Oaktree Capital, had $121 billion of assets under management as of March, said computers can't do things such as meet and assess management teams, listen to venture capital presentations and look at buildings for real estate investments.

""The greatest investors aren't necessarily better than others at arithmetic, accounting or finance; their main advantage is that they see merit in qualitative attributes and/or in the long run that average investors miss,"" he said. ""And if computers miss them too, I doubt the best few percent of investors will be retired anytime soon.""

Marks is known for his prescient investment memos, which warned about the financial crisis and the dot-com bubble implosion.

The Oaktree co-chairman noted computers can help investors make more informed decisions, but they won't replace human insight.

""Computers, artificial intelligence and big data will help investors know more and make better quantitative decisions. But until computers have creativity, taste, discernment and judgment, I think there'll be a role for investors with alpha,"" he said.

Marks has a net worth of $1.9 billion, according to Forbes."

VR still has no killer apps that would create demand for high end cards.

Most people still game on 1080p@60 fps which a budget GTX1060 satisfies now.

Making a game look a magnitude better requires much larger textures. This means DRAM is a major bottleneck going forward.

Nvidia's only solid market ATM is AI and their biggest customers are all developing their own proprietary solutions.

I expect a bump in earnings for sales of GPUs to partners this quarter but weak sales of those partner's cards so a slump in earning from Nvidia in subsequent quarters.

I'm not confident in Nvidia for 2020+ but calls for the next quarter or two are likely good."
101,2018-08-12,folster82,17,My 4 fund Roth portfolio.,"I have been tinkering with my Roth for the better part of 2 years trying to dial in a long term portfolio that I can ride for the next couple decades.

I work in the financial industry and am an aggressive investor. I'm a fan of low cost, lazy portfolios that can easily be rebalanced. 

So here it is:
25% ITOT (iShares Total US stock market)
25% IJR (iShares S&amp;P 600 Small Cap)
25% IXUS (iShares Total International stock market)
25% QQQ (Invesco NASDAQ 100)

I think total market indexes like ITOT and IXUS or their Vanguard counterparts VTI and VXUS are no-brainers.

I chose the S&amp;P 600 for the small cap over other broader small cap indexes like the Russell 2000 due to a more concentrated exposure to small caps and better historical performance in just about all time periods available for comparison.

QQQ is strictly a long term growth play. In addition feel AI is the next tech frontier and QQQ is one of the most diversified ways I can make that play in my opinion.

Having 4 equally weighted funds makes it extremely easy to balance the portfolio. Every couple months, I place buy orders with my recent contributions into the lagging ETFs to try to get all of them near the same value.

▪ ROBT - First Trust NASDAQ Artificial Intelligence &amp; Robotics

▪ IRBO - iShares Robotics and Artificial  Intelligence 

▪ EKAR - Innovation Shares Nextgen Vehicles and Technology 

there are others, but thes are a good starting point when looking to invest in innovation.

Keep in mind that some of these are relatively new etfs, so they are smaller and can be quite volatile as well, so act accordingly, make sure you do your own research.

106,2018-09-21,ROFX_user,1,ROFX - 3 Best ways to invest your $100k," 

You have $100K. Congrats, because not many people can truly say they have such cash at their disposal as free money or money that they can afford to lose. Many people in your shoes really would not know what to do with 100K. What would you do with $100K if you had it right now?

Would you visit some holiday spots over a one year period and spend it all on alcohol and women? There is a recent online story of a man who did just that in Africa in a 2-year period, boasting about how he spent 200,000 Euros on his self-professed “2-year sex tour”! Really?

Some corrupt politicians regularly spend such amounts on trips and shopping sprees. A former First Lady known as “Gucci Grace” was reputed to spend up to 75,000 pounds on shoes on each of her regular shopping sprees in London. Would you copy her example?

Or would you break from tradition and put that $100K to good use in the forex market?

The forex market holds many secrets of making money and is arguably the best place to invest 100K. The fact is that when you have access to such large amounts of money, it can do a lot of work for you in forex, especially when you get a great automated trading robot to work on this money with no required effort on your part. So if you are looking for [where to invest 100K](https://rofx.group/how-to-invest-100k/), the next few paragraphs written below about this topic may decidedly change your life in 2018.

**How to invest 100k**             

As far as 2018 is concerned, the three best ways to invest 100K are as follows:

Automated forex trading.

Buying into Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

Investing in Treasury Bills in Selected Countries.

Of these three options, trading forex and other assets on a forex platform using automated trading software with a built-in AI algorithm is probably the best option for you, given the amount of money at your disposal. There are several reasons why you should consider this option.

Returns on investment are immediate. You get a guaranteed 0.38per centreturn every day on your account, courtesy of the Rofx.net robot. You do not need to Hold On For Dear Life (HODL) for months or even years to get returns on your investment (as in ICOs).

You do not have to do loads of research trying to sift out good what government bonds will give you good returns. The interest rate environment in many western economies are quite low, and you will be lucky to get up to 5per centannually on your bond investments

You get to put your money at work in the most liquid financial market in the world, where money can be made daily. You can make money completely on autopilot using a software that has been programmed to learn to make money from forex even when market conditions are evolving.

You can profit from a market which can put money in your pocket whether your chosen currency pair is trending higher or tanking in value.

So what is the best place to invest 100k?

**Where to** **invest 100k in 2018**

There is a compelling case to invest your 100K in an automated managed accounts service, which deploys a forex robot that is built on AI to deliver the best that automated trading can offer.

Profiability

Profitable forex trading is a product of considerable engagement of time, study, practice and mentorship. It typically takes 18 months to train an individual from being a complete newbie to a profitable FX professional trader. That is why many prop firms charge their trainees a lot of money to cover the cost of training and mentorship programs. But when you use a profitable automated trading software, all the stress is taken away from you. Do you know that AI-driven software can deliver 0.38 per centdaily returns on your 100K investment?

Emotion-free Trading

Apart from profitability considerations, there is also the aspect of emotional influences on trading. Investing 100K in forex may seem easy, but the experiences of many retail traders has shown that when emotion is involved, investing can quickly turn to gambling and all that money could be gone very quickly. Gamblers believe that staking big is equivalent to winning big. Investing in forex does not follow such a mantra, because betting big could lead to a big loss, which can be very damaging to your 100K capital.

Controlled Risk

An AI algorithm can be developed to make robot work with very low risk in setting up trades, irrespective of market conditions. But a human trader will find it difficult to cope with the pressure not to exceed acceptable risk conditions. 0.38per centon a 100K capital may seem small, but when you add this up to produce monthly returns of between 11 per centand 13 per cent, it becomes sizeable. This is not a bad return for a passive income generating activity which does not affect your regular offline income generating activity. If the automated managed account service provider offers a loss protection mechanism, this will compensate for any losses that could be incurred by the robot.

Ever-Present Market Opportunities

There is another reason why automated robot trading is a good example of how to invest 100,000. How many markets present the market opportunities available in managed forex trading? Not many. Stocks do not experience the kind of movements that currencies show on a daily basis. Typically, the earnings season is when we see big movements on stocks. But this is different when it comes to forex. High impact forex news always produces big movements on currencies. This produces volatility, and volatility brings opportunity.

Extras

The discussion of investing 100K for profit cannot be complete without a mention of the fact that you can get loss protection insurance when you sign up to use an automated robot trading service. No one will be amused by a robot that continues to sustain losses on such large capital. That is why a loss protection mechanism is a benefit that only the best place to invest 100K can offer a trader. 100K is not small change, and a 100K trader is a VIP trader. As a VIP trader, you deserve to be insured.

So if you are looking for how to invest 100,000, invest it with a service that can give you all the parameters mentioned above."

108,2018-09-18,eHigh25,9,Chinese Stocks,"I have roughly 5,000-10,000 to invest. This isn’t money that I will need short term. I can withstand some turbulence that may go on due to ongoing trade frictions. I’m looking at a few Chinese companies currently..

BABA - right now at about $150-160/share
Tencent Holdings - roughly $40/share
JD - about $25/share

On one side, buying Chinese companies makes me nervous. Actually, I am an American living in China right now in China, and I see all the corruption that goes on firsthand. I’ve seen the documentary China Hustle, and I’ll admit, I have a harder time trusting these companies due to different regulations and harder access to information. It also is scary to think that these companies are state owned companies and the government can essentially dip their hands into the business whenever they please. I was recently reading an example about JD, and how the PRC didn’t want a country of video game addicts, so they essentially blocked the release of several high profile video games that were to generate lots of revenue. These decisions can be made whenever they want, with little opposition. 

On the other side, as an expat residing in China right now, I see the potential these companies have. BABA seems light years ahead of where some of the western tech giants are. Mobile payments/extremely popular e-commerce platforms and delivery systems. Then you have tencent, which of course owns WeChat. I have not met a single person who doesn’t use it here. Essentially a Facebook with built in imessaging/voice messaging systems, plus mobile payment systems. These companies are chinas Crown Jewels. In a time when China is also pushing to be a world leader in AI, robotics, high tech health sciences, etc, I can’t imagine a situation where the PRC wouldn’t use these companies as their vehicles to harness new and innovative technologies. 

The value seems to be great now. Of course there is heavier risk to these companies, but it seems to me that this could also be a prime time to buy into China’s golden companies for an extremely discounted price. These shares are down roughly 30% as of late, making them attractive, but then again, there are the problems I’ve listed above. 

Thoughts? Any of you all have more insight into Chinese stocks?

111,2018-09-12,seekingtheta_shoes,4,[Serious DD] on TSMC,"Ok guys, so my weekly 2-day WSB ban has expired and I am back. I want to share with you some very autistically intelligent DD about this large company called TSMC. TSMC has become the most dominant semiconductor player that not many people have talked about until recently. They create the most advanced, production-ready node (mobile 7nm and HPC 12nm) and will soon create the 7nm HPC with AMD CPU/GPU and Nvidia GPUs.

The 3 largest foundries are TSMC, Samsung, Intel, and Global Foundry. Out of these, only TSMC is 7nm capable with 5nm w/EUV scheduled for next year. Samsung said they will have 7nm EUV by 2nd half of next year, and Intel's 10nm (equivalent to TSMC's 7nm) is nowhere to be found...

Here is the recent timeline of events:

1) AMD switches over from GlobalFoundry after GF shuts down 7nm.

2) GF is out of 7nm.

3) Samsung and Intel having problems with EUV migration. Intel has a boat load of other concerns (including getting large datacenter chips to get good yield as compared to AMD's multi-die approach - very smart Lisa! ).

4) Rumor has it (https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/11/intel-allegedly-outsourcing-some-14nm-orders-to-tsmc-as-mac-chip-maker-struggles-with-die-shrink) that Intel will outsource some 14nm to TSMC after 50% shortage of supply. That is completely unacceptable. In my opinion, I think big players such as Apple who needs these chips for their macbooks demanded this be done with a reputably consistent supplier.

5) a couple days ago, TSMC reported August earnings that were better than expected, as TSMC was hit with a computer virus (https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20180910PD212.html).

6) TSMC may acquire a memory company (either Nanya or Micron, https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/mannerisms/dilemmas/tsmc-looking-buying-memory-company-2018-09/). The motivation is to develop better integrated solutions that contain both memory and logic/compute. I would really like TSMC to buy MU but it is most likely not going to happen due to US regulations. On the other hand, Nanya has somewhat outdated memory (~DDR3). Maybe some business agreement with MU instead of full on acquisition?

7) Apple will continue investing and using time-tested TSMC 7nm/5nm chips over Apple-rival Samsung, which already supplies OLED and DRAM to Apple.

8) Qualcomm/Huawei exclusively using TSMC's 7nm (recent news).

9) Xilinx (in 5G) using TSMC exclusively.

10) ARM using TSMC exclusively (https://www.anandtech.com/show/11832/tsmc-teams-up-with-arm-and-cadence-to-build-7-nm-chip-in-q1-2018).

8) Future 7nm customers include: AMD, NVDA, Apple, Xilinx, ARM, GraphCore (potential), Qualcomm and other mobile players, custom solns from: Google (TPU), FB, etc.

8b) Future 14nm: Intel

EDIT:

Furthermore, the foundry industry is now looking like the memory industry when only a bunch of players could survive. As a result, margins will naturally grow with lack of competition.

TSMC will own 5G+AI. If you are playing semis, I would overweight TSMC in that basket. Disclosure: I am long TSM

2nd EDIT:

My gut feeling: *EUV (Samsung/Intel) will be very cost-prohibitive (very low yield) till early 2020. EUV (soft x-ray at 13.5nm light) is extremely different than 193nm+double patterning litho (which has been time-tested for a decade+). It is the single greatest change in process technology since the patterning of FinFets. As such, the yields will be extremely poor. TSMC's website slated for risk-production of 5nm w/EUV in 2019, which puts 2020 in production target. TSMC however said that they will likely introduce 7nm FF+ w/ EUV in 2019. * Therefore, I bet Samsung and Intel will have to fall back to non-EUV in 2019 for production, giving TSMC a 1-2 year head start... Of course EUV will be refined but it will take till 2020 to improve yields to production standards. TSMC was very smart in being conservative with their nodes while Intel is cannibalizing their own fabs.

3rd EDIT: Renassaince Capital just recently opened a large long position on TSM (https://www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/09/06/renaissance-technologies-llc-has-140-97-million-position-in-taiwan-semiconductor-mfg-co-ltd-tsm.html)."

Excerpt: ""Tencent is now fighting major wars on two fronts: one is with Alibaba (of course, the war with Alibaba is far from just this front) in the new retail field, and another is with Douyin in the content field. I read a lot of analysis articles and felt that they all didn’t discuss the most important points: the essence of these two wars is the battle of data and algorithms! Alibaba is relying on the retail industry's entire industry chain of data and corresponding algorithms and Toutiao is relying on the content industry’s data and corresponding algorithms to fight hand-to-hand with the middle-aged penguin who has put on weight. Tencent's data strength is very strong, but unfortunately it is not used well, and its algorithms have not made breakthroughs to this point. As an ironclad fan of Pony, taking it all in, I am anxious in my mind and heart.""

As a Westerner with an 'outside' perspective, I've been watching Tencent closely for near a decade (I remember in 2010 when they were offering 1TB of cloud storage for free, a massive amount at the time), but I'm aware that as a Westerner it's hard for me to fully understand the company, its context, its goals, and the Chinese business environment (just as I'm sure harder for native Chinese to understand the American business landscape). I found this essay extremely informative on multiple levels and thought I'd share.

117,2018-10-11,tree_speaker,1,Investing while Supporting Climate Change Mitigation/Reversal,"I'm curious if there are any other investors out there who are taking climate change and reports like this ([https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html)) to heart when deciding on their investments, and if anyone has any strategies besides investing in ESG ETFs for putting their money where their mouth is?

&amp;#x200B;

While I understand that generally profit and capitalism goes against the general principles of environmentalism, I also believe that few people will invest their money in environmental efforts without some sort of financial incentive. While reading \[Drawdown\]([https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank](https://www.drawdown.org/solutions-summary-by-rank)), I realize that we will need to fund businesses with practices that will help us gather data around climate change or actually aid in drawing-down carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  


Here are some stocks I've picked and the reasoning behind them (including future-potential, financial and environmental reasons):

  
IBM

\- owns the Weather Company and is invested in providing climate and weather-based business analytics, this type of analytics will be essential for the viability of the global economy as shifts in climate occur (I think most people can agree upon this, regardless if you believe that climate change is human-caused or that reversal is possible)

\- high dividend yield (3.85)

\- just went through a major restructuring for the future

\- 25 years of patent leadership ([https://www.research.ibm.com/patents/](https://www.research.ibm.com/patents/))

\- invested in AI (Watson) and Quantum Computing

\- analysts say IBM is set-up for a correction

\- fiscally conservative, more responsible tech company that's lasted through multiple burst tech bubbles and has been around longer than practically any other tech company

\- main climate cause: **climate data**

&amp;#x200B;

PEGI - Pattern Energy Group

\- independent energy group which owns and operates wind and solar power facilities sales contracts

\- operates across US, Canada, and Chile

\- headquartered in San Francisco, CA - large talent pool

\- high dividend yield (7.79)

\- positive outlook by analysts

\- main climate cause: **solar/wind**

&amp;#x200B;

TPIC - TPI Composites

\- holding company that engages in the manufacture of wind blades for the wind energy market

\- 2016 IPO with positive outlook by analysts (grew 118.93% since IPO, 9.37% in past year)

\- positive earnings in the past year, but no dividend yet

\- founded in 1968 - one of the oldest wind blade manufacturers in the world - tons of experience in the space

\- main climate cause: **wind**

&amp;#x200B;

TDOC - Teladoc Health

\- Telecommunication healthcare services prevents people from having to drive to a hospital and doctors from having to travel to a health facility, thus besides being a great way to curb emissions, it also will save the economy large amounts of money in travel and wait time to go see physicians.

\- incredibly positive outlook by analysts (grew 98.32% in the past year)

\- main climate cause: **reduce transit / telecommunciations**

&amp;#x200B;

FLIR

\- *FLIR* Systems is the world's largest commercial company specializing in the design and production of thermal imaging cameras

\- positive earnings and high dividend yield (1.29)

\- thermal imaging is a data sensor technology that has not been fully realized in modern day life, but has many positive uses across safety, health, art, crime prevention, etc.

\- thermal imaging will be incredibly important for improving heating and cooling of any facility, and this will become even more important as temperatures become more extreme and we need to conserve more energy and consume less fossil fuels

\- only main risk I can see is if the large phone companies like Apple and Google start integrating thermal cameras directly into their devices (which they should)

\- main climate cause - **refrigeration**

&amp;#x200B;

ADSK &amp; NVIDIA

\- Not going to get too much into detail about them, but largely I think both companies will be huge in their ability to continue to provide tools (such as CAD and AI) that will help us develop even better solutions to tomorrows problems. These companies also largely don't have companies that can directly compete with them on different levels (with the exception of AMD maybe in NVIDIA's case)

&amp;#x200B;

I have also been looking to other investment strategies like \[WunderCapital\]([https://www.wundercapital.com/](https://www.wundercapital.com/)), but alas this is not an option for a non-accredited investor. 

  
**Please feel free to share other stocks you have invested in for similar reasons and/or other similar investment opportunities you have explored.**  


P.S. Also, before anyone says I am wholly optimistic, I do indeed have investments in ETFs and stocks in other companies and industries. This post is purely to promote positive conversation and debate in the ESG pro-climate investment space.

\- Nvidia makes most of its money from high-performance graphic processing units (GPUs)

\- Their GPUs are ideal for training artificial intelligence

\- In fact, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and other tech giants use Nvidia's GPUs to train their AI

\- Not only that, most self-driving car manufacturers use Nvidia’s self-driving supercomputer

119,2018-10-05,apanali,1,Thoughts on chips and semi-conductors,"People who have been following the chip/semi-conductor industry lately have seen some interesting stuff going on. - Intel losing the battle for smartphones (missed the boat kind-off) and been punished due to their integrated model (design+manufacturing). 

\- US government blocked Broadcom's takeover attempt of Qualcomm (national security)

\- AMD stock performing the best in a decade - fabless company (only design no manufacturing)

\- NVIDIA rallying due to crypto and AI boom 

\- ZTE and Huawei blocked in US and other countries because it's Chinese hardware

\- China's alleged chip hack that affected server hardware delivered to many US companies - Amazon and Apple being part of it.

This re-shuffling in the industry, the trend toward modularity (design and manufacturing separated), new areas of growth, AI+crypto+auton. driving, being the major ones, together with national security, suspiciousness towards China being the dominant force, makes me think there's quite some value to capture in this market - up or down I don't know.

Therefore I'd like to hear how the community here views this? What are your thoughts and prediction on how this will evolve. Who are the winners and losers here?

121,2018-11-13,techreview,1,Meet the Robot Who Knows How to Trade Bonds Better Than You Do,"Bloomberg reports on a virtual assistant called Abbie that picks the best bonds for traders to buy or sell. ***Would you trust it?*** 

**What is it?** The bot, built by asset managers AllianceBernstein Holding, scans millions of data points within seconds to find potential trades and suggest them to the company’s portfolio managers. It can find bonds people may have missed, spot human error, and communicate with other bots, [Bloomberg reported today](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-12/meet-the-robot-who-knows-how-to-trade-bonds-better-than-you-do). The original version was launched in May 2018 and handled bond trades worth nearly $19 billion in the first three months. But it was far more limited and needed more precise instructions from human traders.

**Why it matters:** Abbie already supports over 60% of AllianceBernstein’s fixed-income trades. The fixed-income market, which basically trades debt, is one of the most important elements of the global financial market. However, humans still make the final decisions and execute trades based on Abbie’s recommendations.

**A growing trend:** Abbie’s rise in the bond market is symptomatic of the emerging role of AI software within companies, helping to inform people’s decisions by scanning data at a much faster rate and higher volume than they ever could. For example, machine-learning discovery tools are [already doing some of the heavy lifting](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609556/lawyer-bots-are-shaking-up-jobs/) that used to be a job for paralegals at law firms.

122,2018-11-09,Crizzzuu,1,"Are all cryptocurrencies scams and useles? Is blockchain just a buzzword to atract dumb investors to throw money at the ones raising funds? well, Yes and No.","At this point, most of you must've heard something about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Good and bad, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

* *The insane ROI on coins going + 36 000% in a year with hundreds of millions in USD transacted daily*
* *The amounts of innocent people getting scammed who didn't know any better*
* *The people taking out loans and second mortages on their houses, just to lose it all in gambling on crypto currencies*
* *The illegal washtrading and blatant market manipulations going on*
* *The benefits of using the open, auditable immutable distriburtued ledger technologies that blockchain has to offer*
* *This one you must've heard, ""only criminals, scammers and terrorists use cryptocurrencies""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to summarise, you have heard alot of bad things about it, but the is alot of good aswell. Most of what you have heard is true, there is alot of criminal activity, tax evasion, scams, market manipulation etc. going on, im not going to lie about it. But that is not at all what blockchain and crypto is about. There are several bad actors going around and tarnishing the whole space. Blockchain and crypto is a legit movement which aims to better and improve existing industries such as:

* *FinTech.*
*  *IoT.*
* *supplychain management.*
* *preventing fraud and high markups by middlemen,*
*  *providing actual sound money for people in developing countries where there is always a fear of hyper inflation of the local currency due to highly uncapable leaders. (look at venezuela, argentina, turkey, zimbabwe etc.)* 
* *providing verifyable identities to people without identities, can you imagine living without being to verify who you are?*
* *financial inclusion, providing banking services to people with no access to them*
* *tracking and verifying authenticity of a product / good / collectible*

These are just a set of examples what blockchain and crypto can and probably will improve on. Now, dont get me wrong. Currently many, if not most cryptocurrencies are actual scams and money grabs from innocent people tryng to get those incredible gains of 100x ROI, chasing pumps and losing their money.

The key when looking up and investing in cryptocurrencies is extensive research and analyzing of a company and its staff, being patient and not to ""FOMO"" (Fear Of Missing OUT) and finding these companies providing a solution to a problem or an actual upgrade to what the legacy system has to offer. Don't go throwing your money at something someone else recommended to you. Do your own research, it has to be extensive and thorough, otherwise you might just go to a roulet table, put it all on red and wish for the best. Most of the  companies runnig a crypto / blockchain don't even need it. They have no use of it and only try to ride the hype which the ""blockchain buzzword"" offers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just as an example, im going to provide you info on a Canadian company called Adbank and im hoping to give you a different perspective on the crypto and blockchain industry. If you change your mind (assuming all you think about when you hear crypto is ""ponzi, scam and criminal activity"") and start allocating a samll % of your portfolio into crypto, I hope you keep in mind that it is very risky at all times and do some serious contemplating if it's actually a good idea to put some money into what ever it is you are thinking of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about adbank, i'm going to provide you with some background on the online ad-industry, which Adbank is providing its services to. 

The online ad-industry is a place where ad-fraud is running rampant. The internet is riddled with bot traffic (any wehre form 40-60% of internet traffic is bots), advertisers lose 1/3 of their moeny to bots watching their ads and it's actually the second largest source of income for criminal organizations, second to none but illegal drugs. Can you imagine that?

There is a russian group of hackers, who make 3 000 000 USD on a daily basis due to them runnig a few bots. [Adweek actually released an article about this group, which you can read here.](https://www.adweek.com/digital/russian-ring-digital-ad-crooks-reportedly-making-over-3-million-day-175194/)

There is little or close to none transparency in the industry, which industry giants such as google and facebook have been sued several times for. Both advertisers and publishers are pretty helpes in these cases and there was no improvement in sight until blockchain. here are a few articles for youto read if you want to verify:

[https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/06/google-and-facebook-sued-over-failure-to-disclose-political-ad-spending/](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/06/google-and-facebook-sued-over-failure-to-disclose-political-ad-spending/)

&amp;#x200B;

The industry also has a problem with payment times, sometimes ranging between a week or two to motnhs.

Now that we have established some sort of understanding what problems the industry has, lets open up how blockchain can provide solutions to them. I'm not going to go into detail on how blockchain and smart contracts work, due to me not being tech savvy enough and it would probably double the length of this already long post. But i will shortly and very simply tel you what can be achieved.

Through blockchain technology all the transactions become transparent and auditable. What this means basically is that every advertiser can verify that their money is going to the right place and no where else. This kind of transparency has never been seen in this space. heres a quote from the SVP of customer experience at adweek when talking about piloting Adbanks tech:

 

&gt;*“We are excited to be experiencing the way blockchain is providing a new level of accountability and transparency in ad technology. Adbank is delivering on a concept that appeals to the entire marketing ecosystem — and we look forward to seeing how the industry will evolve when it’s deployed at scale”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*David Saabye, SVP of Customer Experience @ Adweek*

&amp;#x200B;

Through smart contracts, the Adbank platform will be able to provide realtime payments for every ad watched, so that the transaction from advertiser to publisher happens in realtime when running an ad-campaign.

Adbank has developed an AI (which they have a patent pending on) which tracks every traqnsaction within their ecosystem and flags fraudulent activity so that a human can double check situation and ""follow the money"" so to say, if a transaction is deemed fraudulent, actions will be taken. Now remember, this is putting it very simplisticly, there is a set of different algorithms, code and procedures taking place in tracking the fraudulent activity. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all could just be so called ""fluff"" and have nothing backing it up. How do you verify that anything they say is true and not all just a big sham? It's not unheard of in the crypto space. 

There are articles and pressreleases by the parties involved, events that the company attends to and different statements from 3rd parties. Adbank has run pilot campaigns with the Austrian government body ANTO and RedBull, aswell as with adweek and flixxel. An article has been published on forbes about it, you can read about it [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ginaclarke/2018/09/25/the-viral-video-that-convinced-the-austrian-national-tourism-office-to-embrace-blockchain/#f9bf52c1b5ae). 

Adbank has attended the United Nations forums about blockchain and actually been awarded.

[https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-cso-kelsey-cole-receives-award-at-united-nations-on-international-peace-day-833a23417fbb](https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-cso-kelsey-cole-receives-award-at-united-nations-on-international-peace-day-833a23417fbb)

They have founded the blockchain research commitee at IAB (Interactive Advertisment Buerau), all the big players within the industry is apart of it. [https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-joins-interactive-advertising-bureau-iab-to-start-blockchain-committee-d85c51e58f96](https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-joins-interactive-advertising-bureau-iab-to-start-blockchain-committee-d85c51e58f96)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to post about all of their achievments, but you can read more about them here, [in their medium blog.](https://medium.com/@adbank)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'ts these kinds of ""gems"" the more serious crypto investors are searching for, with a real usecase and a service to provide. The ones that follow all the regulations and are actually legit companies working to provide a solution to a problem. There is so much potential in this space and in a few years time, we will see that blockchain will actually provide some game changing services to different industries. I'ts up to the savvy investors to take advantage of the current situation regarding the uncertanty surrounding the space and make some life changing investments. Adbank's marketcap is currently at 2 000 000 USD which is comparable to the lower penny stocks. The risk / reward ratio on throwing in a few hundred to thousand bucks on a promising project like this is unheard of.

&amp;#x200B;

123,2018-11-06,hbratt69,1,11/6 News (and predictions) of Day,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I recently joined Reddit on the advice of a best friend of mine while also (finally) opening my own trading account. I have found a lot of helpful, as well as unhelpful, content on here and I wanted to do my best to be helpful to people as well. As such, when I have time I plan on doing a daily overview of current events as well as how I see them playing out in the markets. I'm interested in working for a hedge fund or doing equity research, so naturally writing something like this would not only help on that front but also allow others to engage with me and challenge my ideas. Please note that the opinions stated here are the thoughts of just another retail investor and I am not expressly stating what you should or should not do with your portfolio. With that said, here goes nothing...

&amp;#x200B;

**What's Happening**

* Elections are today (so get out and vote, otherwise don't complain about the outcome)! Many see the Democrats taking control of the House and winning more gubernatorial seats with the Republicans maintaining the Senate. This result could help with Trump's infrastructure plan, which could offer a boost to companies like US Steel (NYSE:X) or Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT). I still remember when Trump won the election and US Steel saw a jump to $39.44 at one point. Regardless of who wins, markets tend to do well through Q2 of the next year, so it should be interesting to see the winners and losers. I could see construction and clean energy stocks doing well with tech giants seeing further declines, assuming regulation is pursued against them. I think financials could go either way depending on regulatory proposals put forth by the Democrats. 
* According to JPM, share buybacks by companies are on the rise. A notable example includes one by Buffet at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) of $1bn in August. They recently invested in fintech firm Paytm, an Indian company that offers a mobile payment platform. Buffet is sitting on \~$111bn in cash which to me is indicative of his not seeing any opportunities at the present. I could very well see him waiting for the next downturn (ie recession) to swoop in and make some purchases at discounted prices, as he is not one to overpay, and thus leading BRK.B to higher levels than we currently see.
* Optimus Ride just partnered with Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) for its autonomous vehicle fleet to upgrade to Level 4 (meaning little human interaction is needed in the operation of a vehicle) vehicles. Nvidia has its DRIVE platform that allows for synthetic testing, meaning that billions of miles in test drives and AI can be simulated without having to ever hit the road. I'm curious to see how the race toward autonomous vehicles turns out with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) being in competition with Nvidia. From my research, however, it appears that Intel is more involved with hardware (chips) whereas Nvidia is more involved with software (AI and synthetic testing). Intel also recently acquired MobilEye which further pushes them ahead. Given each company has partnerships with many large automobile manufacturers, I believe that each can excel in their respective space and reap large profits from this new business in the years to come, bolstering their stock prices in the years to come once we finally see these new fleets completely rolled out.

[USA demographics pyramid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Uspop.svg/800px-Uspop.svg.png)

1.  Demographics shift affecting capital markets &amp; retirement crisis.  The largest and wealthiest segment of the population is the baby boomers.  The majority of them reached retirement age 2 years ago.  After 2008 devastated their retirement accounts, many of them realized that they don't have enough to retire, so they made riskier investment than they normally should have.  Artificially raising the stock market and lowering the cost of capital.  This bear market and recession, will devastate them further, and many wont be able to retire at all.  So what do they do?  Sell the house, and move to cheaper lodgings.  Well, if everyone does that at the same time?  Home prices crash, especially since millenials don't make enough to pay the asking price.  I would not be surprised to see a 50% fall in home values.

2.  Student debt.  Young people from age 20-35 are traditionally the ones that buy homes, cars, and all the big life purchases.  This age bracket is what fuels a consumption based economy. Currently, this age bracket is loaded with too much student debt, which is not dischargable in bankruptcy, to do any of the above.  So we're not gonna be able to spend our way out of a recession.  

3.  There aren't enough gen-xers to fill out the tax paying bracket.  The majority of income tax comes from people aged 40-65.  These people are further in their careers and making more money, therefore more income tax.  There just aren't enough gen-xers to pay the same level of taxes that the government needs to operate with all of the existing entitlement programs.  This is gonna blow a huge hole in government finances.  

4.  Corporate debt.  Since 2008, interest rates have been crazy low, allowing companies to borrow ""free money"", and then they used that money to buy back their stock and artificially raise their stock price, netting their executives hefty bonuses.  Interest rates rise, they have to pay back the loans, but a recession &amp; bear market cuts 30% off their stock value right from the start.  Where is that debt payment money going to come from?

5.  Government debt.  we're at $21trillion and counting.  We've run out of people to borrow money from, and the rest of the world will be dealing with their own financial crises.

6.  Global financial depression.  Germany, China, and Japan each depend on exports for over 30% of their GDP.  If the US is in recession, who is gonna buy their goods?  

7. The EU is going to collapse.  This is why Merkel stepped down now.  Cause she doesn't want to be holding the reigns when shit hits the fan.  [European demographics](http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/images/2011/Oct/Fourplex_demographics_1600.jpg) are way worse than Americas.  They are not going to be capable of consumption-fueled growth for at least 30 years.  There are no young people to pay taxes to fund the retirement of the old people.  They just aren't there.  So those pensions that the boomers were counting on, wont be z

8. Italy and the rest of the southern European countries joined the EU for access to Germany's credit card, and then they elected a series of politicians who bought elections by guaranteeing social programs, instead of using those loans to modernize their economy and infrastructure.  So now, you've got tons of debt, empty promises, and non-competitive economies.  Italy's debt is at $2.2 trillion, 15% of which is bad standing, and that's AFTER the EU redefined the rules for rating debt.  Italy doesn't have the demographics to be able to grow its economy, so they wont be able to repay that debt.  

We could deal with any 2 or 3 of these, but all of them?  At the same time?  At the same time as a recession and stock market crash?  No way Jose....  And I didn't even mention automation and AI.....

My current position.  I pulled out of the market entirely 6 months ago.  I'm holding 5-10% in precious metals, and the rest in cash.  Cause I want to be able to pick up some sweet deals on assets when the dust starts to settle in two years +/-.  There's gonna be a lot of blood in the streets, and I'm gonna buy property.  


TLDR:  Putting this all together, we have a bear market, a recession, a fundamental and game-changing shift in demographics, a retirement crisis, too many young people in debt, and not enough gen-xers to pay the majority of income tax.  And that's just America.  The next 10 or so years, are gonna be rough.

128,2018-12-26,kikipi,1,Using Artificial Intelligence to set-it-and-forget-it,"We all know that 75% of stock exchanges happen using AI. We’re constantly trying to beat the system with our predictions, while we’re literally being suckers to AI.

I know some of us love creating diagrams/lines over charts and analyzing bell curves at 9AM. To them, props for following your passion.

But I’m wondering if there’s a known machine learning software out there that I could just set a daily allowance to, and forget it. Ideally it would scan through 100s of news articles in the evenings/mornings, check every stock prices (close and open) in the morning, and make the best mathematical predictions for me to buy. Then, sell faster than anyone else once my preferred cap was reached. Or when it predicts it will be the highest.

If not an AI which can go through the news, at least just for analysis of all numbers to automatically buy and sell for me.

I’m not saying this will be 100% accurate, but even just at 80% it would be amazing.

Are only banks allowed to use these softwares, or are there some released to the public as well?"
129,2018-12-25,Gofoxx,1,Is studying economics/finance nowadays not smart?,"Hi everyone!

I'm a high school student who is wondering what to study in university. In my parents' opinion it is not smart to study finance, as it is getting harder to find a job due to improving AI and automation. 

I'm very interested in investing and the economics and I've been investing my own savings for a few years now. In my opinion there are more things to finance than trading and long-term stock investing and I think it would be interesting to study finance and mix in a litte bit of tech as minor studies. Do you think it would be a smart move to study finance or economics in uni or is the time of Wall Street and finance as we know it already over?

You can also tell about your own experiences if you are studying/have studied finance or economics.

Thanks!"

Several other cryptocurrencies are going to be affected as well.

The publication reveals a fundamental vulnerability of ECDSA, the very core of almost all current crypto(currency) technologies. The group is planning a live MSM event in which they will present the findings of the research and demonstrate that an almost complete wipeout of the market value of crypto assets within hours can be initiated at any time if the technology becomes available to individuals or groups with malicious intent.

The content of the research document and the date and time of its publication are known to the authors of this post. We advise all holders of BTC positions to take the appropriate measures to prevent a possible total loss.

131,2018-12-10,ilikepancakez,1,Alphabet’s Waymo is revving up to become a $100 Billion Business,"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/09/alphabets-waymo-is-revving-up-to-become-a-100-bill.aspx

Not only is self-driving going to be just as or even more profitable than advertising, it’s far more future proof and indicative that Google’s choice in diversifying into a conglomerate like Berkshire Hathaway as Alphabet through alpha oriented bets continuously pipelined from their R&amp;D divisions is finally paying off. 

Where other tech companies have largely stagnated and fallen off from their prime (i.e. Oracle/Cisco/IBM/etc.) or have taken the largely safe and ultimately limiting path of expanding only to their nearest adjacent markets (i.e. Facebook/Apple/Amazon), Google has had the foresight and vision to look beyond any one market or strategy and realize that it’s true potential/moat lies in the exceptionally talented engineering workforce and pipeline it’s been able to cultivate over the years. With Larry and Sergey continuing to be at the helm, I strongly believe the perspective they have coming from a PhD engineering background has allowed Alphabet to build up huge advantages by understanding and capitalizing on the sheer exponential power and growth that technology creates. 

There’s a reason why Alphabet is so far ahead in the self driving race. Because when everyone was ridiculing and making fun of them for wasting money on “toy projects” like self driving cars 10 years, they were the only ones with the foresight and knowledge with their heads down seriously working on the problem. Similarly, when DeepMind was acquired by Alphabet, again it shows just how well they understand what the future will be. 

A monopoly on machine learning / AI, is de facto a monopoly on *everything*, and Alphabet in my opinion is truly the most well prepared in reaching such a goal. Self-driving is just the start too. Look to Alphabet’s life science and computational biology divisions like Verily or Calico, to see the next area of investments, which will soon start paying off."
132,2018-12-05,WeeWillieWinkieHODLr,1,Better Investment than AMZN,"So, I have AMZN in my watchlist, but I am starting to question, why?

*""Size is the enemy of performance""* Warren Buffet.

So, what has AMZN got going for it?

* Ecommerce, ok. But I have probably more compelling names in my watchlist, like MELI, BZUN, V, CGNX related to that industry (I actually own CGNX).

* The cloud. But I'd prefer ANET, NVDA, or maybe even EQIX.

* AI. There are probably better names, NVDA, CGNX, ISRG.

* Exposure to India. AOS, V.

So, why Amazon. Can anyone enlighten me?

Can anyone suggest investments they believe will outperform AMZN (any sector, any industry)?"
