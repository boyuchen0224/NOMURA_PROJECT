3,2020-01-24,street-guru,1,A couple of reasons to be bullish on Facebook the next few years,"The ongoing rollout of AI-based tools is expected to allow Facebook to bring on more small businesses with local ad budgets. Such small businesses will have a growing number of options to source leads directly from Facebook (as well as Google). This means the gap between the number of Facebook's business profiles (currently \~140m) and actual advertisers (currently only \~7m) should begin to narrow dramatically. Analysts estimate the number of advertisers on Facebook will increase as much as 10 folds. Which would also mean Facebook should see a period of sustained ad revenue growth as a result of this significant TAM expansion. The Street also continues to underestimate the long-term monetization potential of billion-user products like Messenger and WhatsApp. Looking nearer term to earnings results next week, advertiser checks by analysts suggest no deceleration in the US and some recovery in the UK."

7,2020-01-13,rrsu_,1,How do some companies pay unsustainable high dividends?,"Hi! I'm looking to understand how some companies that seem to have a very high dividend yield TTM manage to sustain high payout ratios over time, even though multiple financial markers make it seem like they're consistently going down.

Here are a few examples (numbers come from the IBKR platform, nasdaq website and other sources): 

1. AI (Arlington Asset Investment Corp) - Dividend yield TTM \~16%; revenue trend is negative, gross profit is negative, book value per share is consistently decreasing, negative EBITD. Payout ratio 0? since the earnings per share are almost entirely negative and they still pay quarterly dividends.
2. MTR (Mesa Royalty Trust) - Dividend yield \~11% TTM; revenue trend negative, book value per share decreasing, positive EBITD. Payout ratio is \~99%
3. HCAP (Harvest Capital Credit Corp) - Dividend yield  TTM \~11%; again negative revenue trend, same for gross profit, BVPS decreasing, EBITD positive but decreasing. Payout ratio is 695%?

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose my question is a bit broad, so I'll try to break it up a bit. I'm mainly interested in understanding how these companies operate. The dividend yields are enticing for sure, but they are way above average and do not seem sustainable. The companies themselves also look like they cannot sustainably operate the business from a financial perspective (note that I have very little financial knowledge) so I'm trying to figure out how to properly read these numbers and what things I'm missing.

1. Why would anybody want to invest in this stock? Conversely, if these dividends are so high over long periods of time, why doesn't everybody invest in these companies?
2. Are there any specific strategies that would have to be used in order to actually profit from these stocks?

If this doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll try to clarify as much as I can. Thanks!"

10,2020-01-09,ichi-zero,1,"Big ""data"" is the new ""oil"" - Trend Investing","Here's a phrase I've heard ""Data is the new oil..and king"" - Partially correct.

""Data is the new CURRENCY and those with the most USEFUL data and ability to REFINE new data is KING"" -There you go - fixed. 

There are various types of ""data""

=&gt; Bulk ""data"" for data's sake (NSA Prism)

=&gt; ""processable data"" (Telemetry data collected from end-consumers)

=&gt; ""usable data"" (Filtered data w/ noise removed)

This conclusion I've arrived at is similar to John D. Rockefeller's during the age of OIL - he realized refining oil (processing data) is a more stable business than mining for oil (data). EVERYONE can mine data now, but it's mostly useless unless it's refined to show relevant data.

A better play for the future imo is data storage and AI that will be processing these mountains of data (e.g. Micron, Western Digital, Seagate, Microsoft, Google).

If you look at data creation projection for the next 5 years - it's unprecedented. Furthered by the age of digital content streaming and creation- Youtube, Netflix, Disney+, Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime TV.

Prime example: Google's Stadia is far from a flop - it was rushed to market just before Xmas not for sales - but for consumer awareness - and gives Google time to implement fixes and stabilize their game stream infrastructure just AS 5G/Wifi 6 is being rolled out and adopted - with significantly lower latency - comparable to a wired connection; the massive bandwidth increase is almost secondary.

Again, all this data - (cold storage, backup, fluid data, etc) all needs to be processed and storage SOMEHOW.

PS: All puns were refined and processed as intended."
11,2020-01-06,street-guru,1,AAPL well positioned to outperform in 2020 despite its massive run in 2019,"The FAANGs are increasingly competing against each other, and are likely to start seeing divergent performance after largely moving together the last few years. It will be a battle of the network effects, and AAPL is well positioned to win/outperform because:

1) it has direct  relationships with 900m or 15% of the world's wealthiest consumers;

2)  its successful transition from a product-based company to an ecosystem  company means its relationship with users is becoming increasingly sticky and a product-based company (e.g. Samsung) can no longer  disrupt AAPL; only another ecosystem company (e.g. Google) could  compete;

3) AAPL's increasingly recurring-revenue business model is  driving its valuation multiple expansion;

4) AAPL has the best data for machine learning and AI to drive long-term data network effects,  because its closed ecosystem greatly limits fraud;

5) its enormous net cash position provides the flexibility to invest strategically and  return of capital."
12,2020-01-06,Biglipped_bandit,1,Self Directed Roth IRA Investing Strategy,"Hi All,

All of this is based on ETF's.

Not new to investing, but have learned a lot since I have started and am trying to understand strategies around buy and hold vs trading, and how to correctly spend cash on new shares.

I had come across a strategy in a book that suggested doing the following:
     In the various sectors that you invest (Renewables, AI, S&amp;P, DOW, etc) you buy the ETF that has the best 3 month gain, and every 3 to 6 months you would repeat the process. So it is a constant chase for the best performing ETF at the time. 

     What are thoughts on this strategy?

Now, I did that for Oct 2019-Present, and out of the 8 sectors I was in, 2 of them completely lost me money and I sold (-20% is my threshold). The other 6 that I kept, are all positive except for 1 holding, with ranges from 5%-15% gains.

Also, probably completely separate, when you have cash on the sidelines waiting, how do you decide which holdings to buy more of?

TLDR; should I chase the best 3 month gainers in various sectors? If not, how do I allocate free money to buy more shares of holdings without being biased?"

Happy New Year!

In the grand scheme of investing I know very little and am always looking to learn more. With that said I would say I know slightly more than most in their early 20's. 

Since I began my job in June of 2019 after graduating college, I have saved up \~$12,000 in my investment portfolio and am up \~13% (Yes, I know that we are in a record bull market and we're basically ""shooting fish in a barrel"" in terms of picking winners). I have a couple novice questions that may seem elementary to a bunch of you, so bear with me.

\-I am told quite frequently during investment small talk at work, ""you're young, you can absorb market hits"". While I fully understand the fundamentals behind that comment, why would I want to? Why not sell everything and wait for the bottom to fall out (at least in my tech-heavy stocks and ETF's)? 

\-My livelihood does not rest in the \~$12,000 in my investment portfolio by any means. A portion of my paycheck is sent there each month and I am happy with where I'm at. However, b 

\-This is more so attractive since I have student loans to still pay off, which is why it has been at the forefront of my mind. Student loans coupled with a steaming hot market, seems like an easy decision to sell and throw it at my student loans. It seems like beating the 6%-7% interest rates will get harder and harder the further into this record run we go.

\-No, I do not think I can time the market. No, am I as knowledgeable as most of you here and think I can out smart you or the AI out there that are also riding these highs. I'm just a young, dumb 20 something year old seeking advice (I am often told self deprecation works well when seeking advice). I would discuss with my friends and peers, but not many people geek out about investing like me in my age group.

Thank you in advance."

15,2020-02-26,canuckinfla,1,Tips for a novice's portfolios,"Hello, I am currently managing two portfolios (one in CAD, one in USD). Quite new to investing. Currently my gf and me we have maxed retirement accounts, and maxed employer pension contribution. My current portfolios look like:

Cash: \~150k

Holdings (CAD): 

* 30% in ZQQ/XQQ (ETF tracking Nasdaq 100 CAD-Hedged)
* 20% in RBC's Global Technology Fund
* 20% in RBC's Global Technology and Life Sciences Fund
* 10% in VFV
* 5% in VUS
* 5% in ZPL (BMO Canadian long term provincial bonds ETF)
* 5% in XRE
* 5% in XUT 

Very messy, North America oriented, tech-heavy portfolio. Lost several thousands in (unrealized) gains in the last few days. I am fine with that. All I did is to laugh about it and go r/wallstreetbets for more stories, lol. However, I am in process to rebalance to something simpler e.g. couch potato.

Holdings (USD): 

* 50% in VTI
* 40% in VXUS
* 10% in BND

Still under construction, but aiming for 3-fund, maybe with some REITs. Is 90/10 stock/bond too aggressive?

My questions:

* As I am quite new to investing, would some slice&amp;dice or tilt be workable, or strongly not recommended? E.g. 5-10% of total portfolio toward mutual funds / ETFs tracking Nasdaq 100, S&amp;P500, or REIT ETFs. The reason is that I think tech, especially with the recent AI boom, has pretty good growth potential than some other sectors. While real estate seems to have quite consistent performance edge over some other sectors.
* Equity vs real estate: would a bit of real estate fit in a portfolio, or are REITs preferable? I am quite  uncomfortable trading on margin, but ok to leverage by taking a fixed rate mortgage.

Planning to set &lt;5% of portfolio to active investing in the future, mainly for fun. Would love to build a mostly passive portfolio, eventually with enough income for retirement. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!

More info about my risk tolerance:

Something I am willing to learn, and practice with (fake) money first:

* option trading (especially when used to hedge against risk)

Something beyond my current risk tolerance level (but feel free to correct me, especially if these items are less risky than I though):

* trading on margin
* derivatives more exotic than options
* day/swing trading (I do not consider myself competent enough to consistently time the market)
* leveraged ETF, as leverage magnify losses more than gains
* naked shorts, option writing, etc. anything that has potential for large losses
* YOLOing ...  

&amp;#x200B;

More details:

* Age: 33-34, 
* Salary income: 200-250k/year. Very safe and stable, even in the event of a 2008-level crisis.
* Tax status: US resident for tax purposes (gf), Canadian resident for tax purposes (me)
* Risk tolerance: low (gf), medium (me)
* Time Horizon: 30-40 years.
* Assets: negligible. House worthy \~500k, but mortgage payments ongoing 
* Mortgage: \~10% of our after tax salary
* Other expenses: \~20-30% of our after tax salary 
* Savings each month: 60-70% of our after tax salary
* Other Debts: No student debt, no other debts.
* Other financial information: No need for kids education fund, as our employer will cover it. House is large enough to raise kids, so no near term big house purchase unless we want it."

This news comes a few days before their quarterly reports call on Wednesday.

Etsy has risen 28% in the past three months. 328% in the last three years (Look below).

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/introducing-etsy-nasdaq-etsy-stock-121000229.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/introducing-etsy-nasdaq-etsy-stock-121000229.html)

This quote is directly from the above link: ""During three years of share price growth, Etsy moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.""

Etsy is definitely a woman's store. But they sure do love it. They’ve had positive eps in their last four quarters.

In my opinion, Etsy is a company that artsy Becky's love. To all you out there that have experienced a relationship, I am sure a good portion of your women has purchased something off of Etsy.

Anyway, their earnings call is 2/26 on after hours. Highly recommend purchasing some calls before their report. Especially now while they are still affordable.

And with your gains, buy some moon stickers off Etsy while you’re at it.

tldr; Etsy is like the artsy girls equivalent of amazon, buy-in it now while it's low. Make some calls for the quarterly report. 3/20 60$."

21,2020-02-18,artofgio,1,Coronavirus Will Reward the Wolves and Punish the Sheep,"TLDR: Panic selling is what stupid people do and it can be one of the costliest decisions an investor will ever make. Your short term capital gains will never, ever make up for the lost potential gains you'll suffer. 

I have a fairly forward-looking portfolio: The big boiz (T-MAGA), some other tech and AI, some midstream and renewables, some entertainment and streaming; and others, freckled with some biotech, dividend champion/aristocrat cushioning, and safe, old favorites (The Warren Buffett picks, mostly), and one thing I'm seeing is that stocks that are super strong are getting shaky (some of them are getting hammered) due to what I believe is panic-selling.

Most successful investors (those that have not lost money) know that panic-selling is the Morgoth of money already, so if at least 80% of your portfolio is long term (as in hold or buy for at least 3 years) then you don't even need to read what I'm about to write because it's old news to you.

Anyway, here's some fun, but very true facts:

* Coronavirus (COVID-19)
   * has killed \~2000 people (according to USA Today)
   * is new and interesting (dangerous)
   * will likely be under control before summer.
* Orthomyxovirus (THE FUCKING ***FLU***)
   * between 12,000 – 61,000 **deaths** annually since 2010 ([https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html))
   * is constantly mutating its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes (remember H1N1? that's what those letters are. )
* The US economy
   * is stronger than it's EVER BEEN.
      * you heard God-Emperor Trumpiboi. 
      * is growing and isn't showing any signs of stopping.

That said, I'm seeing companies like T-MAGA weathering the storm as expected, at least for now. Apple opened low so I increased my position and - wouldn't you know - it went back up 3 bucks. Google is teetering but it's fucking google so it's not going anywhere. You get the picture: winners don't just magically start losing. They can, however, appear like they have magically started losing when people who run for cover every time some blowhard reporter blows a situation out of proportion start panic-selling. 

So what? Who cares, right? Buy low, sell high, am I right? Well, in case anyone has been under a rock for the last couple of months, short-sellers (you know who you are) have been getting their shit packed in more violently than ever before. Why might this be? Oh yeah, because the economy is stronger than it's ever been. It's somehow super easy for people to forget that when a virus that only knocks off the very young, very elderly, and the otherwise immunocompromised takes out a near-invisibly small fraction of the population. This causes them to fear for the worst, especially after seeing such unbelievable returns, and they start having visions of their portfolio drenched in red. So they figure ""fuck it I made my money, time to get out before the world ends."" 

To be clear, I am absolutely saying that you should never, ever sell a stock. There are certainly times in the history of the economy where it's been wise to sell. A popular example nowadays is sears vs amazon. But selling positions in strong, promising companies just because ""OMG GUYS LOOK AT ALL THE RED OMGOMG CORONAVIRUS MUST BE KILLING MILLIONS"" is just dumb. These people are the sheep I'm talking about.

Again, why do I care?

I care because it took me a very (very) long time to shake that mentality and come to a point where I only sold a stock under at least one of two conditions:

* It's huper high (or just overvalued) and none of my best resources have given me any reason to believe it's getting higher
* There's another stock that's super undervalued and I have very good reasons to believe it will grow.

But, before I grew up, I lost so much money in panic/short-selling that I'm embarrassed to say how much. To give you an idea, however, I will say that at one point I owned a large amount of microsoft at a cost basis of \~30 bucks a share that I sold at 32 because I didn't really like PC's and all the people who told me AI, cloud computing, and deep learning were the ""way of the future"" were, to me, the same dumbfucks I made fun of for buying Ferrari IPO. If I had listened to those whose experience far exceeded my own and just held my investments, I'd have 6-bagged it with msft, not including the dividend. I also owned Tesla at 147 and Apple at 115 but I wont say how much because it just hurts too badly. 

So now, even though it is still very hard to see my gains seemingly dissolve before my eyes, I know that if I give in to the panic someone patient and smart enough to wait will buy up the shares at a discount. Nope. Fuck that. I won't let fear cost me another dime, and neither should anyone reading this. 

Every investor i've ever talked to has admitted to panic selling in the past. What separates good investors from great investors is when they learn to stop. Even Buffett has made some bad calls. Bad investors, however, never stop giving in to their impulses. I wasn't quick to the lesson, to be sure. I have been investing for 14 years. I have a bachelor's degree in fine art, a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in chemistry, a master's degree in biomedical science, and am currently halfway through a doctorate. That's 11 years of ""higher education"" SO FAR, and it still wasn't enough to get me smart enough to just take advice from rich people. After all, that's what I want to be: rich.

So, when the market likely tanks this week, just remember there are some people that, had they taken this advice years ago, could be living debt and mortgage free with a multi-million dollar portfolio to retire them by age 40. Hint. Fucking. Hint.

**Bottom line:** **Panic selling has cost me roughly 6x more money in lost potential gains than any other expense in my life, yes, even more than all the college. So just chew on that for a second. When your eyes widen and you go ""oh,** ***fuck*****..."" just imagine how stupid I feel.**"

Son has been believing in ""group strategy"" or ""郡戦略"" in which he invests in the best companies in their fields, e.g. ARM, Boston Dynamics, Uber, WeWork, etc. believing that their synergy surrounding AI will lead to the AI revolution, giving up doing the fundamental R&amp;D research himself. Skimming through SoftBank's annual report 2019, R&amp;D was mentioned only in ARM's section. I believe SoftBank needs to invest more in fundamental research to become a true leader in AI and the information revolution.

25,2020-02-07,Thehamii,1,NVDA vs AMD,"Hi all,

Currently trying to pick between these 2 and having done my own research wanted to throw it out to this sub to see what I’ve missed.

Coming at this pretty much purely from a cloud gaming view which will dominate gaming in the future.

AMD: Also in the CPU market and are making major in roads here, and will likely grow market share in years to come. Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu’s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so.

NVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably. Not sure what NVDA would then do in this space, especially since cloud gaming may dislodge their GPU sales in consumer devices.

Leaning towards AMD at the moment but would welcome any thoughts."

Starting out in the stock market investing game and have been working on creating a diverse ETF portfolio. I have posted what I am currently leaning towards and was wanting some opinions whether there are any obvious red flags or any improvements that can be made. 

Bit about myself to help you understand goals. 

Interested in buy and hold strategy. High risk tolerance. Looking for an aggressive growth porfolio. I have approx 30 yrs before needing nestegg. No big debts. Combination of Roth IRA, 401K and taxable accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

VOO        Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (alternative - VTI)  40.00% 

QQQ	Invesco QQQ Trust	                                   7.50%   -  high likelihood tech will keep advancing.

VGT	  Vanguard Information Technology ETF	           7.50%   - same as above.

IJR	iShares Core S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF	                   15.00% 

VWO	Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF	   10.00%

VEA	        Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF	   10.00%

FREL	Fidelity MSCI Real Estate ETF	                    5.00%

Balance 5% will be random ETFs I may keep changing - eg. Biotech, AI, Military, Battery etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are no Bonds above. I am currently deciding whether to have them now or maybe a little later.

Above percentage allocations are not set in stone. Just playing with them at the moment but this is where I roughly see them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Advice goals:

&amp;#x200B;

\- If the % allocations are way off compared to what typical portfolio should be, please inform.

\- Is there too much emphasis on foreign stocks above? VEA + VWO = 25% (I feel in a few years, emerging markets will shine) 

\- I do not have much mid-cap exposure. Is that an issue?

\- Any above funds with too much overlap? If so, any alternative recommendation? 

\- Any better alternatives to above funds overall and why you think that. Keep in mind I would like to aim for overall low expense ratios. Slight up/down is fine. I have looked around quite a bit while selecting each fund but of course there can always be better.

\- For the funds that may require changing as time goes by, any type of account I should avoid? 401k, taxable etc.

\- Sample aggressive and moderate portfolios so I can compare and get better understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for all the help/advice in advance!"

They'll ask themselves, how can we make sure this never happens again?

They don't want to be at the mercy of their employees.  They don't want to shutdown for weeks at a time.  They don't want more regulations.

The answer won't be ""let's give our employees more benefits"", ""how can we make our employees more happy"", ""what legislation and precautions should we take to prepare"".

It's going to be how it's always been:

""How can we make sure we need as few employees as possible, get the most out of them that we possibly can, while paying them as little as possible?""

Right now the AI machines are totally oblivious as to the state of the market and are hilariously forecasting in all markets business as usual projections into the future.

Obviously with some lenders and banks outright refusing to write mortgages right now with how speculative the market has become at this moment, I can't help but cringe looking at listing which tell me that in the next year the market is forecasted to appreciate 5%.

So I have to ask, when are they super duper smart AIs going to start getting besieged with data and start correcting?

Obviously team worry warts could be wrong and tomorrow we find out that a nice glass of orange juice after a long mouthwash is the hidden cure to all of this and business might return to usual after a few bail outs.

But as we go for what Bill Gates has conservatively said will be 60-90 days on essentially worldwide economic shutdown and possibly longer, and some point these algos are going to something.

**How it Works**

So for the past 2(ish) months I have been working on a Python program that uses the Alpaca API to gather the basic price info for a stock for the past 1000 days. It then groups the days by week, then by Up/Down or sideways. From there it can take the current price info for the week, compare with past weeks to tell if this week will most likely be up or down (and sideways). Once it can tell what direction the stock is moving this week it then looks at past price movement for Up/Down Weeks to tell by how much it will change. It does this each day for 2601 stocks with predictions getting more accurate over the week.

The order is for 5,000 full size electric buses, for use in various locations. The vehicles have an average cost of 800,000 Renminbi (approx. $115,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling 4Billion Renminbi, or approximately $575 Million USD.

The vehicles will be procured from a number of manufacturers within MEG's partner alliance and will be subject to a rolling delivery schedule throughout 2020 until 2022. MEG has identified commercial EV buses as a strategic segment of its business, and one in which it feels it can derive significant revenues in the next few years as EV buses deliver significant ROI for tour bus and city bus fleet operators in terms of fuel savings.

""This order is a pivotal moment for our organization, as we move to EV for our bus operations"" said Xu Yingcai, Chairman of Beijing Silk Road Rainbow. ""Our transition to clean energy is important to our organization, but also for our customers who depend on our transportation services and rely on us to make the best decisions for the environment. We are delighted to work with Mobile Energy Global and their Qingdao sales hub to fulfill this order and bring our autobus fleet to a cleaner and more energy efficient future"".

37,2020-03-16,tttmmmsss,1,Crisis Means a New Business Era | WSJ Op-ed,"&gt;**Crisis Means a New Business Era**

&gt;*Cheap energy, a shift from China and remote work will all shape the long-term economy.*


&gt;The junk-bond-financed $6.75 billion buyout of United Airlines collapsed on Friday, Oct. 13, 1989. The stock market immediately dropped 191 points or almost 7%, equivalent to a 1,500-point drop today. Scary.

&gt;Rod Berens, head of research at Morgan Stanley at the time, called a departmentwide meeting after the market closed. I dreaded going. I had a list of tech stocks I was recommending that got killed that day. When I showed up, I noticed several cases of champagne—a weird way to celebrate the loss of wealth. But why not? I grabbed a glass; it was Friday.

&gt;And then my boss headed toward me. Uh oh, I thought, he’s going to fire me. Instead, he smiled, gave me a high-five and said, “Congratulations, now it’s your turn,” and clinked my glass. Talk about confused—one of the worst days in my professional life and I get congratulated?

&gt;I didn’t see it at the time, but he was dead right. Eras change, sometimes overnight. Over the next decade, the stock market shifted from junk-bond-fueled buyouts, a dominant Japan and the Cold War to highly valued emerging technology companies, ending with the dot-com blowout.

&gt;The current market turmoil tells me a new era is breaking, so question everything. Will cable, energy, mobile and social media ever come back? And if not, what’s next?

&gt;Well, the knee-jerk reactions will come first. Most think the 2003 SARS epidemic in China ushered in that country’s era of e-commerce, but it was going to happen anyway—the crisis only accelerated it. So be wary about talk of robot and drone deliveries. It may come to that if the virus spreads, but the economics still seem far out.

&gt;Will energy stay cheap forever after this week’s devastation? I doubt it, but the economy can finally benefit from fracking’s cheap natural gas. I’d bet so-called clean and renewable energy was set back a decade by having to compete with lower prices. Cheap fossil fuels may also push back any new adoption of carbon-free nuclear energy.

&gt;More interesting is the emptying of countless college campuses, sending students home. Classes will be online-only until further notice. Smart. But at some point parents will surely ask, “Why again are we paying 78 grand a year?” Is the end of universities far behind?

&gt;Similarly, lots of companies are telling employees to work at home. Will an era of telecommuting and no rush-hour traffic finally arrive? Maybe not. Recall that early in Marissa Mayer’s tenure as Yahoo CEO, she banned working from home because so many people were, as they say, mailing it in.

&gt;The end of China’s dominance is certainly coming. No one will ever again concentrate manufacturing in China alone. Vietnam and other countries with low-cost labor will benefit. Maybe this is Africa’s moment. Related: A louder globalization backlash may arise again—but since consumers like cheap goods, it will flame out.

&gt;Another observation: Interest rates and the Federal Reserve may be increasingly irrelevant. The Fed’s job seems to be to ensure the availability of Treasurys—mostly, as we wrote last September, as collateral for the repo market, which finances an increasing share of global trade. The $500 billion announced Thursday is encouraging.

&gt;What about mobile and cloud computing, and even the stock market and its trillion-dollar valuations? It’s worth asking, as venture capital and private equity using cheap debt are keeping companies private longer, or forever. Others think it is value stocks’ turn to shine, but that usually requires a period of inflation that I certainly don’t see coming. Quite the opposite.

&gt;No, growth will still rule, but with a different set of leaders. In the bio world, DNA sequencing and Crispr gene editing are starting to ramp up. Health care will be transformed by new ways to detect and treat cancer and other ways to cure previously incurable diseases like sickle-cell anemia.

&gt;In the high-tech world, mobile seems tired. Apple’s hottest product is AirPods Pro, those Star Wars-inspired white sticks hanging out of everyone’s ears. That’s an accessory, not an innovation. Here’s hoping for some knock-your-socks-off new mobile products. Note also that we’re only about a third of the way into the cloudification of enterprises. And we’re only beginning to master machine learning and artificial intelligence, with their ability to find patterns that humans can’t. I think the next tech era will be driven by implementation of AI-infused systems into every business.

&gt;Finally, I asked the man himself, Rod Berens, whom he’d high-five today. He says that the past 30 year’s tech abundance means the developing world’s billions will finally see productivity improvements and attract an increasing share of investment. That’s probably right.

&gt;New eras are notoriously hard to predict. So instead of focusing on which cities are quarantined, start thinking about what’s next. Very few investors do."

I have an outlook of at least 300 years and while my personal risk tolerance is high during my lifespan, I must also consider various risks. Previously, I have trusted US equities completely, following dollar-cost averaging and avoiding to look at the market. However, I am looking to divest towards international equities as history shows superpowers never stay at the top forever. International equities also provides currency hedges against devaluations. I am planning to invest a significant portion in gold due to possible hyperinflation that could wipe my portfolio (as seen in 1920s Germany), while generating income with covered calls. Bitcoin is currently a significant portion of my wealth, not because of recent purchases but the large appreciation it has enjoyed since I purchased it. Although I am not exactly long cryptocurrencies in general, I am willing to risk 10% of my portfolio for potential upsides, possibly using covered calls to generate income.

Bye bye markets as we know it.

First Crack
Find it yourselves it’s on Forbes somewhere you Sapiens.

Second Crack


Firstly below is a link to the strategy being run on Gold, if you go to Yahoo Finance you can download data from other instruments and run it and you’ll see it works on most of them. I’d suggest using portfolio theory to maximise gains. 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/16qwY1t71GvDuvduJ1qltX3ejB6xUGCku/view?usp=sharing
GOLD

The equation is simple, unlike the first one, it's E=MC^2.
Exponential Growth =  Money Compounded upwards with the second moving average!

Process
1) Daily Charts at 5X leverage. You can get this on eToro for example.
2) If instrument is above the SMA2 at the end of the trading day you invest, if it is below the SMA2 you close your position
3) If the instrument is above the SMA2 at the end of the day and you have an open position you close the position and compound in your gains, therefore multiplying the profit by 5X for the next trading day. If you have an open position and the instrument is below the SMA2 you close the position and check back the next trading day to see if you invest, the next day, if above the SMA2 you reinvest minus the loss from the losing day.

Example:
T0) GOLD is above the SMA2 on the daily charts. You invest €100 @5X leverage, which means you have €500 in play on the market.
T1) GOLD has risen 1% and the chart shows again it is above the SMA2, so you have made €5 profit, considering this is 1% of €500. You then close the trade and reinvest the €105 so you now have €525 at play in the markets.
T2) GOLD drops by .5% so you now have €522.375 on the market at the end of the day. You close the position so now for the next open day you have €104.475, because the GOLD market is below the SMA2 you are not reinvesting that day.
T3) Gold drops again by .5%, you are not in the market so you have made no loss, you see it is below the SMA2 so you do nothing again this day and do not invest.
T4) Gold rises by .5% and you see it is now again above the SMA2, so you invest the €104.475 in the market at 5X leverage."

&amp;#x200B;

What is it?

&amp;#x200B;

This Deribit and BitMEX market making bot earns on fee rebates when making an individual post-only limit order turn into a position. It also gains from the (average) difference in spread on an individual instrument, and as I saw overnight while I was sleeping it gains significantly on the convergence of perp vs futures arbitrage based on funding rates.

&amp;#x200B;

Moon!

&amp;#x200B;

You can review the bot's graph in real-time here: [http://jare.cloud:8080](http://jare.cloud:8080) \- note that since the huge climb and for most of today it took a break, as it noticed the increase in balance and decided to sleep for a day (the higher of my two Takeprofit values). I've manually intervened and it's now pumping out trades again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm offering the bot FREE of charge for those people who use my referral link. My referral link earns a % of fees when people market out of a postiion (every other ordering cycle it reduces it's skew, and on either layer of stoploss/takeprofit it first reduces it's skew back to delta-neutral then all the way down to 0 position). I believe in Free and Open Source as a religion - and while the final bot that we end up putting into production will have configs and values fed to it by our AI at Coindex Labs, the Intellectual Property for the bot without AI is mine and I decide to share it. There would need to be literally tens of millions of dollars on this bot for it to hurt anyone else's edge.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm asking for people to sign up for referral links, I've closed the repository with the bot until after people provide proof they've signed up on the referral link. While the bot was 100% open-source before, I noticed that 40 people cloned the repository in one day while I only received maybe 2 referral link signups - which isn't sustainable. Once you sign up on the referral link, you're free to review the code in full or have someone audit it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ideanomics Provides Updates on Subsidiary Treeletrik, plans IPO**

&amp;#x200B;

*- Ideanomics eyes Treeletrik IPO in 2020*

*- Treeletrik receives land title in port area for development into assembly facility*

*- China-based manufacturing partners to be part of land development, to include belt-and-road investment*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

NEW YORK, March 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Ideanomics, (NASDAQ: **IDEX**) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced an update on its Malaysia-based Treeletrik subsidiary.

Ideanomics acquired 51% ownership in the holding companies of Treeletrik in 2019 and the company has since begun organizing itself for growth in the ASEAN region. As part of its expansion plans, the leasehold of land graded for development has been upgraded to title holder to offer Treeletrik flexibility with the development of the 250-acre site at Gebeng Industrial Estate in Kuantan, Pahang Darul Makmur. The assessed value of the land is approximately 100 Million ringgit or $25 Million.

As part of the land development strategy, Treeletrik is planning to bring in a number of China-based manufacturing partners to help round out the EV offerings under the Treeletrik brand. Those discussions are taking place directly with Treeletrik management and augmented with discussions facilitated by Ideanomics' MEG subsidiary. MEG has been able to attract interest from China's belt-and-road development agencies for the South Asia and ASEAN regions, and anticipates that interest to develop into investment both directly and through China-based commercial EV and battery manufacturers.

Already under way with its expansion, Treeletrik has secured sizeable electric motorbike and moped orders through distributors in Indonesia, and talks are ongoing with other countries expressing an interest across their vehicle range. Indonesia's population, like many other countries in the ASEAN region, relies heavily on motorbikes for transportation based on two important factors of cost and traffic congestion. To compliment the bike sales opportunities, Ideanomics is assisting Treeletrik with developing a focus on commercial EV activities.

Additionally, as the land development, manufacturing partnerships, belt-and-road investment, and large-scale orders will all result in significant expansion in both Malaysia and International operations of Treeletrik, the company will look to go public in either Singapore or Hong Kong, with the possibility to do so later in 2020. The IPO will provide Treeletrik will additional capital to fuel its growth plans, and in turn unlock value for the broader investor market.

NEW YORK, March 10, 2020 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- [Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2745651-1&amp;h=202550487&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics), (NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced a detailed update to its Mobile Energy Global (""MEG"") activities, including the impact of the Coronavirus on its Q1 activities.

In general, Chinese companies returned to work at the start of March with most major commercial activities slowly getting back to normal. MEG's partners have been impacted to varying degrees and recent conversations have shown there is a resolute effort being made to recover quickly from the effects of the outbreak. Currently, there are no details available for any government stimulus programs to help the Chinese economy recover from the shutdown, so we are unable to determine what participation opportunities, if any, may be available to Ideanomics and MEG.

**A: Financing / Funding for Fleet Purchasing**

In September 2018, Ideanomics announced its agreement with First Auto Loan, regarding lease financing and ABS products with a target of raising $6 Billion to fund the lease financing of ride-share vehicles and other types of app-requested taxis. This agreement is currently in progress and will benefit from the capital sourcing referenced below.

In November and December of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced the creation of multiple funds in association with Dasheng Licheng Lease Financing, with Ideanomics bringing in several high-profile insurance companies to provide large-scale funds to support EV lease financing programs. The final province-level registrations were underway when the outbreak occurred and are now back underway. The impact on bringing these funds to market will now extend into Q2 but should otherwise remain unaffected.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an agreement with China's Yunnan province which included lease financing for the heavy truck segment, with backing by AAA-rated province-specific entities in conjunction with MEG's lease financing programs. The deal also provided for investment into charging station infrastructure, as well as investment into Treeletrik via Yunnan's role as the ASEAN region's belt and road sponsor. The shutdown impacted the timing on this, particularly as it pertained to final registration and approvals at local government, but is expected to be reinstated in the near term.

**B: EV and EV Battery Manufacturing Alliance**

Over the course of the past 18 months or so, Ideanomics, and subsequently MEG, has partnered with leading EV and EV Battery manufacturers, including JAC, Geely, Beijing Foton, CATL, and Yinlong, among others. These partnerships are an important part of the overall offering and assist MEG in offering competitive procurement and order fulfillment. Having best-in-class partners ensures we can meet the needs of fleet operators in terms of vehicle specifications, quality, reliability, and cost and continue to attract large-scale order interest.

As part of the commencement of activities in Qingdao, we will be showcasing many of these partners at our EV sales hub and anticipate additional manufacturing partners participating based on their value to the overall offering.

We had begun to implement a joint marketing strategy with select partners, including our participation with CATL in the now postponed EV Mining event in Stockholm, Sweden on March 18-20. It has been tentatively rescheduled until November of this year, due to Coronavirus concerns.

**C. Joint Ventures and Other Strategic and Umbrella Agreements**

Ideanomics and MEG has announced several agreements as either joint ventures, strategic partnerships, or umbrella agreements, which form part of MEG's business development and revenue pipeline development activities. These include deals with the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for MEG involvement in supporting the transition to EV mining, which we anticipate will be a significant revenue division for our organization; Zhitong 3000, where we intend to offer their fleet customers' MEG services; activities securing relationships with tourism associations to develop EV tour bus revenues; and more. Each of these is progressing in the normal course of business in the context of earlier sections of this update and, in particular, section A as it pertains to lease financing services.

**D: Sales Agreements for Execution**

In August of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with iUnicorn, to procure and finance 90,000 taxis for the city of Chengdu, in addition to other cities. In September of 2019, MEG announced the delivery of an additional 4,127 taxis, with confirmation of a further 11,000 to be delivered by the end of 2019. These are subject to the return of local government, to process the final rebate and registration approvals. We anticipate this occurring when the spring temperatures reduce the impact of the outbreak and cities return to normal levels of commerce and the resulting demand for public transportation is restored to pre-outbreak levels.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an order from Yunnan province for 35,000 taxis, and an additional order for 2,300 taxis from the city of Guillin, in Guanxi province. Both of these orders are delayed due to the closure of non-essential local government services, which we anticipate returning to normal in a similar manner to the iUnicorn JV.

In addition to the sales agreements mentioned above, the MEG team has developed a diverse pipeline of sales orders, with interest and activities in all four of its EV revenue divisions of Heavy Trucks, Buses and Coaches, Logistical Vehicles, and Taxis. In lieu of the lease financing funds availability, MEG has been pursuing bespoke financing for each order, respectively. Furthermore, the recently announced Qingdao sales center activities will help further augment sales going forward.

**E. Global EV Sales Expansion**

In March of 2019, Ideanomics announced the acquisition of 51% of Malaysia-based EV manufacturer and distributor, Treeletrik. Since the acquisition, Treeletrik has hired an experienced CEO from the automotive industry, increased its sales and after sales operations, upgraded the land secured under the acquisition from leasehold to title holder, secured orders elsewhere in the ASEAN region, and is in negotiations to bring in a number of Chinese EV manufacturing and EV battery partners to help round out its KD and assembly activities such that it can scale its supply operations to ensure order fulfilment.

Outside of Asia, MEG has received some preliminary order inquiries in the Middle East and plans to broadly expand its global footprint once all of its China-based activities are under way.

**F: Energy Sales**

MEG's core strategy is to acquire fleet customers, through offering innovative and cost-efficient transition to EV, such that we transition the consumption of energy from Gasoline and Diesel onto cleaner Electricity. MEG has signed numerous joint venture and strategic partnership agreements to help develop its relationships in this regard and plans to sell both pre-paid electricity at a discount to fleet operators, as well as participate in the lucrative EV charging market. Each of these is valid and in process for normal course of business, with the major highlights detailed below.

In July of 2019, Ideanomics announced agreements with Three Gorges, to include Tianda Energy and Ding Fang, and Palcan Energy to finance and develop EV fast charging networks. MEG has continued to explore these and other EV fast charging technologies, including those from our EV battery partners, as detailed in the PetroChina update below.

In September 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with PetroChina, to begin a project to repurpose gas stations to EV fast charging stations, starting with the city of Nanjing. To date, as there is rapidly-evolving technology development in the areas of EV charging and energy management and storage solutions, we are dependent on the certification of new technologies and apparatus for commercial use such that we ensure the most up to date technologies and charging experience are deployed.

**G: Other Financial Services / ABS**

In August of 2018, Ideanomics announced an agreement with NTC to provide ABS refinancing for buses in several China cities, including Tianjin. Subsequently, Ideanomics announced agreements in January of 2019 with financial institutions to provide financing and other services to support the ABS under the NTC agreement.

The debt rating of Tianjin at municipal level, along with delayed deliveries from manufacturers, has proved challenging for underwriting and issuance of ABS. In June of 2019, Ideanomics signed an agreement with EV bus and battery manufacturer Yinlong covering both China and Ex-China activities. As Yinlong had already delivered 5.1Billion RMB of manufacturer financed EV buses in Tianjin, outside of the Ideanomics agreement, we began discussions in late Q3 / early Q4 with Yinlong to reorganize the registration and recording of those delivered assets such that they can be compliant with ABS requirements. That activity is underway, albeit it was disrupted and delayed by the Coronavirus activities in the region. Additionally, MEG plans to work closely with Yinlong in 2020 to help support the delivery of additional city bus orders in order to facilitate the ABS refinancing accordingly.

In June of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with GCL, to include GCL contributing guaranteed sales orders of 500,000 logistical vehicle orders over the next three years. These orders will require financing under the lease financing activities covered in section A, as the original barter-plus-subsidy deal put in place is not being accepted by manufacturers. Several of the small to mid-size orders from the GCL order flow are currently in the pipeline to help develop and streamline the deal expediting process of our lease financing activities.

46,2020-03-05,drunk_on_koolaid,1,CMV: Trump's negative interest rates,"This 🌈🐻 (hi!) thinks that Trump will get his way with negative interest rates. While I do not agree, I'm going to debate on Trump's side here b.c, well, yolo.

CMV, negative interest will make America great again

--

Negative rates are great even for the average American.  You get paid to pay off a loan, and your new*, upgraded bank account will invest your money into an ETF or bond portfolio of your choosing.

There's a catch, but we can all live with it since it's coming anyway. Your banking institution will need to restructure. With positive interest rates we have a rigid structure that doesn't allow looming changes.

Increases in automation, blockchain development, and low bond yields globally are forcing restructure plans for government and banks. The future Trump is pushing for will include all of these. Mobile banking already removes barriers to accessing your money. (No more telller.) Blockchain will secure transactions. (Global outreach via mobile banking; greater security.) Free access to investing platforms will keep bond issuances low. (Mobile investment platforms allow everyone to invest in AI that manages your money, including bonds; AI systems will appropriately price markets, reducing volatility.)

Negative rates are inevitable, especially if Trump wins. The banks will have to adapt, fast, as the fed is already playing ball in Mar-a-Lago.


TL;DR
-Recieve to pay-off a loan
-Pay to hold money in banks
-Lending will increase
-Volatility will increase, only until people are mostly removed from the asset management equation"

I've mostly been investing in ETFs and some stocks to play around, but over the years have gotten more interested in building a long-term buy &amp; hold stock portfolio myself. I currently have some time to spare and interest in analyzing companies and doing some legwork. 

There are plenty of posts here that discuss whether individual stock picking can beat the market or not  - this is not one of them.

I'm mainly looking for legit services that don't spam you with upselling their services (think MF) that could help along the way in screening and researching stocks. Resources I'm currently using are FT, WSJ, and Handelsblatt (suscription); and barrons, yahoo finance, Morningstar, google finance and vhinny (free).

One that I'd be particularly interested in is '**New Constructs**', which is a mix of human and AI robo advisor service created by MIT and HBS professors and researchers. Their proposition is to be ""the only Investment Research provider with a U.S. Patent for a system and method to reverse accounting distortion and analyze financial information to automatically determine the true profitability of a company, making us one of the top investment research firms in the nation."" Their research gets featured regularly in finance news across the board including Barrons, Reuters, Forbes, NYT, cnbc, etc. Their two premium services are priced at $50 and $100 per month.

Has anyone heard of them and have any experience? Open to other recommendations, too.

Recent press conference this was specifically mentioned for scale. I think Microsoft is planning a Machine Learning Store for commercial purposes working like the App Store for pre-made models.**

Also I work in the Data Science Field.

——————————————————————

As some of you may or may not know, Power BI has the ability to add pre-made machine learning and deep learning models internally

Once I learned about this I knew where Microsoft was headed

I’m thinking machine learning and AI will be a sort of addition to power bi users completely nulling the need for learning code, why?

Microsoft’s job is to make it as easy as possible for everyone to use their systems and this is why I think Microsoft will have a similar variation of the “App Store” for machine learning models and algorithms

Actual engineers will have the unique experience to be sort of like an app developer where they develop their code and publish it in the App Store and people using Power BI will be able to either download it for free or for a small fee

In their recent press conference about Power BI they mentioned pre-made models being directly implemented into the power BI software and said that this was done specifically for scale

In my opinion, I really think this is the direction Microsoft is headed with their Power BI software and their implementation of scale through Machine Learning for everybody

For days, I have been thinking about throwing my entire savings at this bad boy. Here's why:

As far as I know, Arista provides the infrastructure to build software driven cloud networks, partnering with cloud giants like Microsoft.  From the website, quote - unquote,  'Arista Networks is a leader in building scalable, high-performance and ultra-low latency cloud networks with low power consumption and a small footprint for modern datacenter and campus environments. ' I am no expert on this, but for what it is worth, I am pretty certain cloud computing will get stretched as fuck during this coronavirus shitshow, and even more so in the (near) future where we will almost certainly experience a paradigm shift to more remote working, with cloud technologies at the forefront.

On top of that, just yesterday, Arista boasted a Cognitive Wifi solution amongst other things that mean absolutely fuck all to my autist brain. Read it up yourself, but my understanding is that it ""(harnesses) the power of the cloud, big data analytics, and automation"", "" enables higher data rates and increased capacity"" and ""provides customers with enhanced Wifi experience for critical video collaboration applications and the power of cloud-based AI for rapid problem resolution"". We all know what that mean don't we.

Ok, maybe not, which is why I am here. Any experts in this field, or just anyone who knows about Arista here could enlighten me on the potential of Arista technologies?

Moving on to the financials, this boy sure as hell looks juicy. Net income has consistently been in the uptick, with over 830 million last year, more than twice of its net income in 2018. It has 2 billion in cash, in case anything goes south which I doubt they will. Net debt is fucking 0, unlike many other companies which are already positioned far more shittily in this COVID fuck fest. Capital expenditure has also been on  a steady rise, beckoning more technologies that could help position itself as we become increasingly reliant on data networking and cloud computing. Its cash flow has also been nowhere but in the uptick. As of now, Arista hasn't really been a Wall Street's favourite with many anal-ysts maintaining their mediocre ratings. Generally, I don't see a problem with this company's financials, and with a P/E ratio of  18x -20x and its potential in the near/long term, I don't see a reason why this isn't a buy.

Ok now,enough said, I am tired as fuck. Now, roast the fuck out of me and tell me if it is retarded of me to throw money at this shit."

62,2020-04-18,cashforstonkers,10,Tesla Long Term Bear vs Bull Thesis,"With Tesla moving back towards its ATH, I thought I would provide my perspective on the supreme-meme stock. Before the Tesla cultists jump on me and spam ban requests for my account, I want to give a bit of background. I bought Tesla 10 years ago when it was less than 1/10 of todays price, and sold a few years ago for a profit. I love Tesla's products and would gladly buy one of their cars myself. However, this is strictly about the value of their stock which I feel is very overvalued right now. Those of you who think you are visionaries if you are just now buying this company in 2020, lol. You are very late to the party and at this point are being spoonfed a lot of ideas by the new mainstream that are not supported by deductive reasoning or data.

Before I go on, I am aware that Tesla does not follow fundamentals nearly as well as other stocks. The wild speculations and cult-like following make the short-term prospects for this stock very unpredictable. I am just attempting to make an educated guess about the long term performance of this stock.

&amp;#x200B;

The Bull Thesis

1. Tesla's cars are the best thing since sliced bread or the first iPhone. They have the highest owner satisfaction of any car, and will become the most prevalent car on earth in the future and monopolize the market
2. Tesla is not just a car company, they are also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company. Thus they are a premium, innovative technology company more comparable to Apple than GM. They will monopolize several of these different markets
3. The company is not profitable now, but its income will continue to grow exponentially in the future due to our society's moving to green technology, and Tesla's prime position to capitalize
4. One fund manager (Cathy Wood) says she expects the stock to hit $7000 in the next 4 years (lol!)
5. New factory in China = \~1.5 billion Teslas sold (I'm being facetious)

The Bear Thesis

1. Not much of a point in focusing on current fundamentals or TA, since based on its current stock price Tesla's market cap is larger than the 3 major US automakers combined. Everybody knows their current sales are nowhere near justifying this valuation
2. We are on a 12 year bull run that many (most?) are predicting is over. In a recession/depression, the animal spirits that kept Tesla flush with cash despite their losses will fade away
3. Also in a depression/recession, less people are buying expensive electric cars or new cars period
4. Tesla investors want to believe it is a tech company, but a car manufacturer's profit margins are highly unlikely to ever match traditional ""tech companies"" (software &amp; electronics) in the future. There is a ton of competition, large overhead costs to produce and ship these products and the auto industry as a whole has been declining for years.
5. Electric vehicles are limited by infrastructure. The world's population is mostly urbanized and increasingly so. Where do you charge an electric car for an hour+ if you live in a small apartment, as is the case for nearly the entire millennial+ generation?
6. Tesla will suffer due to rock bottom oil prices. Going green is nice but ultimately economics are the strong guiding hand towards electric cars. It appears that oil will be cheap for at least a few years. Additionally, Trump is likely to win the next election (I don't like him myself, but I think this is the harsh reality). His presence will not benefit green companies like Tesla for the next 4-5 years
7. Government incentives that helped a lot with their early growth are drying up
8. Tesla has never paid a dividend and the company is very leveraged. Comparing it to other brand-name tech companies is silly based on this fact alone. Just look at their 10-k history, without the dreamer aspect it just looks atrocious. There is a reason this 17 year old (they are 17 years old and still not profitable!) company's debt is still junk rated by the major credit rating agencies. In contrast, Apple has had a net income of well over a billion dollars since 2005, before the iPhone even came out. Pretty much every other big tech company is the same, massive sustained profits for a long time.
9. By the way, since they were rated junk prior to March 22 Tesla does not qualify for Fed bailout money if things start to look bad
10. Tesla is seen as a leader in a few green fields right now largely *because they are allowed operate at a loss.* Other companies do not have this same luxury and are expected to return big profits. Toyota can't just go full electric and operate at giant losses, their shareholders will go nuts. Tesla has been allowed to do this for a surprisingly long time because of animal spirits. As soon as these green energy fields become profitable and the infrastructures start to take shape other companies will immediately jump aboard in droves. GM already has the Bolt which is actually a great electric city car. Volkswagen has spent tons of cash on EV development. I am sure as soon as total EV sales numbers become more than just a small niche their EV portfolio will take off, along with many other manufacturers
11. ""Tesla is also a solar/battery/autonomy/AI company"". I see this quote nearly everywhere Tesla is mentioned. None of those are profitable for Tesla and all of them have major competitors. I think it is unlikely for Tesla to be a monopoly in any of these fields. Facebook/IBM/Nvidia/Google/Amazon are way ahead of Tesla in anything AI related, they are all filled with Stanford/MIT/Berkeley etc. graduates with 6 figure salaries. Similar statements can be made for autonomy, in which Tesla is also not the leader. Ford and GM are doing surprisingly well in autonomy, arguably they are outpacing Tesla  [https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882724/ford-autonomous-cars-vehicles-av-austin-texas-taxi-delivery)
12. There are competing core car technologies. Hydrogen fuel cells, while inferior at the moment, have had several breakthroughs that may propel their green technology further in the next 10 years.  See here:  [https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52328786). A lot of Tesla's value is hinged on their absolute dominance of their type of electric vehicle technology in the long term future. Challenges to this thesis substantially hurt their valuation
13. ""The future is self-driving taxis everywhere, and they will all be Teslas."" Another common point that is made, which is quite unlikely due to existing competition. Uber has a big leg up already. But also, going back to fuel cells: fuel cells recharge in the same time as gas, a couple min. Tesla's batteries take well over an hour to fully charge. Time charging is time not spent driving, which is lost revenue for a taxi. For now electric batteries are the winner, but it is not certain that in the long term future this will be the case
14. Many Tesla cultists think the growth will be exponential and soon their cars will be in every driveway. Just like when the iPhone came out, it grew exponentially for a long time. This thinking is flawed. For one thing, the iPhone has saturated in market share. At this point in time almost everybody who wants a smartphone has one and the phones are starting to blend together, we are entering a new period for the phone industry. Tesla will saturate the same way, their market isn't even a new field like the iPhone's was since people already have good cars. Once the early adopters have their cars, Tesla becomes less of a novelty. You are already seeing this in rich neighborhoods in California. If 3 of my rich neighbors have Teslas I want something unique. This is one of the main reasons no car company has ever been totally dominant.
15. Covid-19 will likely change the world, telecommuting will likely become much more of a thing. Jim Bianco talks about this a lot  (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLz2PJnj1M)). Historically a lot of people have never telecommuted and didn't know how to do it. Businesses needed to figure out how to structure themselves to operate in such a manner. Now that they have overcome this hurdle, telecommuting will become much more prevalent. Less driving to work = less need for an expensive car like a Tesla. For my weekend car, I'll stick with the manual transmission Porsche which is much more fun to drive for a couple miles
16. China. They opened up a factory in China, great. China has never stolen anybody's technology before (/s). The iPhone, made in China but its sales there have always been crap. They only recently hit single digit millions in a country of over 1b since the government actively promotes domestic brands, and strongly takes their side in courts. If a Chinese company makes a ""Resla"" that is an exact copy of the Model 3 and then sues Tesla for IP violation, you better believe they will win in China. China is experiencing massive GDP losses right now and an uncertain future, both politically and economically. There are many talks right now of reducing our reliance on China due to Covid and punishing them. IMO this all does not bode well for future sales of Tesla's pricey electric cars

TLDR:

Overall, I think that Tesla is a great company that will do amazing things in the future. We just have a lot of ""dreamer"" investors right now who think Tesla has some kind of infinite magic sauce. People who bought the stock early did well. And in 8 years, I think you will probably be able to buy their stock for $500 and enjoy a decent dividend and some more steady growth to follow. I think the people buying and holding at today's prices will see more crashes and no/low profits for a long time. I can see it retesting and crossing the limits that were hit in the crash a month ago, as Covid is far from gone at this point. I would only buy this stock if it goes below $200, and definitely would sell right now if I was holding."
63,2020-04-13,proprietism,2,Setting a coherent trailing stop-loss strategy,"After cutting my losses on a lot of bad stocks, I've rearranged everything and now have a portfolio I'm optimistic about the long-term future with: mainly top growth stocks, Berkshire, index fund ETFs and robotics/AI/automation ETFs, plus a few gambles on oil, airlines and Covid-19 related pharma as my short-term play. I could hold this portfolio as-is and be happy but my gut tells me we're in for another crash and extended recession if this thing really isn't going away this year. 

I've got cash that I may continue to put in more shares for DCA purposes, but I'm thinking setting a trailing stop-loss on at least half of my shares of everything so I lock in what gains I have, then rebuying shares at lower cost - especially when I see what gets oversold if this heads south again. 

I don't want to set the trailing stop-loss too tight and sell too quickly in one down day, but I also don't want to lose too much profit to not even make it worthwhile to sell at all. If I set a 10-15% trailing stop loss, that will put half of the stocks below cost basis, but if I set a 6-7% trailing loss, that could easily get triggered in one bad day or a couple consecutive down days, only for it all to bounce back quickly. 

Are other people taking this approach? If so, what are you doing? I don't want to sell now because I like my stocks and this thing could keep going upwards if the government keeps propping up the dead cat, but I don't want to get stuck with everything down 20, 30, 40% again either when I can cash out earlier and be rebuying everything at that time."
64,2020-04-10,eagleburger,1,Trying to assess the current investment environment,"Hi, I've been trying to analyze what's gone on over the past few months in order to find a prudent investment strategy going forward. I'm hoping that people smarter and more experienced than me will tell me where I may be wrong.  

To begin, I'd like to assume that all major players are intelligent, rational and acting in the best interest of those that they are responsible for, rather than speculate on wild conspiracy theories and nefarious puppet masters. 

With respect to the stock market, it seems that the biggest immediate questions are:

1. Will the Fed get involved in purchasing equities near term?

2. Is there some sort of coordinated short-squeeze happening in order to setup the next leg down in global equities?

3. Is there something that would make the major US indexes test their highs or lows near term?

4. What about equities outside the US?

---	
For 1), I just don't see it in the immediate future. While purchasing IG and HY debt makes sense (questionable in terms of the tenets of capitalism and prudence in long term prosperity) to keep businesses afloat until the economies restart, there's no point to the Fed purchasing equities. 

Assuming that Donald Trump cannot walk into a room and say ""make the stock market go to all time highs so I can get re-elected"", no one benefits from this. We were already at the end of a credit cycle and likely headed to recessionary conditions even without Coronavirus. Who are going to be the incremental buyers? 

Trump already looks like a hero for recovering to these levels, he wouldn't even need any more juice. For those saying that ""they are bidding it up so his cronies can get out"" that's pure rubbish. If there truly was a coordinated effort between the administration and outside players to conspire there are many derivatives and other vehicles they could use instead of bidding up the entire equity market. Trump is smart enough to know that jobs are more important than stocks (for his base in particular) so he'll focus there. 

People also point to the example in Japan during the lost decade (gov't purchase of equities) but it's not remotely similar. The same level of speculation doesn't exist in the U.S.. Sure it's a bit frothy but it doesn't seem like a bubble that needs to be gradually deflated.  

The only condition under which the Fed would step in would be if things got very ugly and crashed hard and they needed to intervene because equities were being severely mispriced to the downside and capital markets completely dried up. Private investors would leap at this opportunity. No way this happens. Again, assuming that the Fed is being run by prudent actors, they would only purchase things on behalf of the public if was in the best interest of the public and under no circumstances would buying overpriced equities be part of that. 

---

For 2), maybe, I don't know. While I can see algos making short-term decisions to run stops and front run trades, this level of ""signalling to other algos"" and coordinating a massive leg down seems far fetched but perhaps the AI and coordination is there now. 

It seems more reasonable that various funds and these algos are consistently adjusting weighting based on risk premiums and are bidding up equities because bonds have skyrocketed and there's no other investment vehicle that provides yield. The risk premium has plummeted. During the initial crash in Feb/March, everyone could see that a recessionary environment was going to crush businesses and they still had reasonable (relatively speaking) yields on bonds so they flooded that market. 

Even if there was further bad Coronavirus news, there's nowhere to go. USD and bonds have spiked huge. What options are there for them other than ride lower yields for the foreseeable future across the board? Sorry for the doomsday put holders but I can't see another massive equity crash with everything rebalanced like this. 

The problem with this viewpoint is that it doesn't explain the initial crash in Feb/March. If the market players are truly great at reevaluating value in real-time, why the huge drop and rebound? I don't know but the simple answer would be that the algos and funds didn't know how to initially react to Coronavirus and, as time passes, they are getting better at pricing things accordingly (resulting in lower actual volatility ahead). 

---

For 3), I can't see anything that would push up the market much further and I can't see anything that would make it drop significantly. Large companies have a Fed backstop now on debt so zombie companies (at least for the short term) will be a thing. If retail investors started liquidating their financial assets to pay bills because the helicopter money isn't reaching the consumers fast enough, I think there would be institutional demand. Plus I think that the helicopters have plenty of fuel and payload. 

---

For 4), We're in the global economy and these markets will get bid up for the same reason that the U.S. ones are: There's yield there that will be driven down (higher stock prices) to adapt to the new norm of low-return investing. Perhaps certain economies will tank but that's likely already baked in and there's probably more money to be made trading sovereign debt instead?

---

So, where are the real investment opportunities for the average Joe like me? 

a) Small or micro-cap equities that are outside the focus of the algos and funds? Possibly, but they face the headwind of a recessionary environment and I'm not sure if they will see the benefits of easy credit in the same way that larger businesses will. I don't know how VCs and Angels will change their approaches for investing in private companies. Relatively speaking, perhaps this is a good asset class for stock pickers. Investors may be able to get more equity for their money. 

b) Medium/large company stocks? I can't see how. These have already been priced for incredibly low yield and there still is some risk of a price drop-off. So many people believe that a massive sell-off is still coming which may make it a reality. Where's the reward for the risk? 

c) Gold? I own Gold and I don't really know why. It doesn't make sense why it rises but it does. It should sell off like all commodities but it doesn't. I will likely be long gold for the next few years because historically it does well in this type of environment but I don't know why and I hate it. It has no place in the modern economy and it will crash again one day but likely not soon. 

d) U.S. dollars? The USD has a massive advantage in that no country wants to see it tank. It's the same reason why DeBeers hoards all the diamonds. If the reality of its worthlessness was every truly embraced, everyone would lose, so it's not going to happen. And given that we're likely going to see deflationary pressures from unwinding credit, this seems like a logical choice. For those that predict an impending inflationary environment, I don't see how. Money velocity is dropping, there's a demand drop that will be around for a long time, and inventory will build with little supply side problem. Factories in China and other countries aren't going to slow down, or at least at the same pace of decreased demand. 

e) Selling option premium? VIX is still pretty high, but again this is very risky because who knows what could happen? You'd really have to believe in this thesis. 

f) Shorting certain stocks? Maybe. I'm not good enough to know what to short to make up for the risks. Maybe China? 

g) Patience and wait to purchase real assets? Real estate and other hard assets may come down significantly over the medium term. I think preserving capital and looking for buying opportunities for distressed assets may work. 

In general, it seems like investment yields are going to be extremely low for a long time with no great options. I'd love to have a discussion about this stuff for anyone interested. Thanks!"

66,2020-04-03,3STmotivation,1,Portfolio consisting of 50% tech stocks (pros and cons discussion),"With all the talk of 5G, IoT, AI and new software dominating the markets for the next decade, would it be a mistake to build a portfolio that for 50% consists of stocks in the tech field or would it be the best move in order to try and get the most returns?

Examples of the tech stocks I am referring to:
Alphabet... Microsoft... Apple... Nvidea... Honeywell... Qualcomm... Intel... Facebook... Baidu... AMD... Micron...

The risk should be obvious, with so many companies in the same sector it makes a portfolio incredibly vulnerable to a sudden collapse. Another risk is the fact that most of these companies are competing with each other on one or multiple fronts, which means that not all of them can come out on top and give the return on investment so many are hoping for.

The upsides are just as obvious though, the tech sector is growing at an incredible rate and the development of new technologies will continue to become a bigger and bigger part of the every day life of people. Investing in these companies is an investment in the present, but even more so in the future of the market.

What is your opinion on this? How are you building your portfolio with an eye for the future?"

69,2020-05-11,StoicGrowth,1,"Just a few words about ""smart money"", don't mind me","In every universe known to man, ""smart money"" wins because smart money *is **what moves** the markets*, not in words like the news or politicians, but in actual mass, worth, mathematical impact. It's a machine, sort of a hydra, so many heads they might as well be hair. I don't know who said that the kinetics of smart money are basically gravity in the universe of *valuation*. Not just stock markets, valuation entirely, because the very idea of value tends to be subjective like that. It's gravity, it's everywhere, it pulls every atom in the universe. There's no ""counter"" force, it doesn't exist. There's no ""shield"" either, it just is.

That's why you never defy smart money, if you know where it stands (that's the hard part, and no it's not a ""secret""). That would be the equivalent of jumping over a cliff to prove something (*spoile... oh come on.*). That's why contrarians still hedge, on the side of caution. That's why people still buy houses or gold or invest in education even at the worst of depressions —if they can, after they feed themselves. That's why governments know they can pile debt like there's no tomorrow because effectively, if smart money says ""there's no tomorrow"" then the sun don't shine that day and it's all there is to it. Netflix still rolls as usual (arguably more, even). That's why wages can't rise too high but bonuses will.

It's the ultimate absurdity of it all: we can say just about anything like kids do in games, and it happens. We just seldom do, not really, not like that. *End wars?* Done. *End hunger?* Done. End disease? Nope, nobody can do that, so collectively saying so doesn't matter. When can vaccinate, but then it's a conspiracy to sell Windows. This absurd insight is one of magnitude, not a generalization that mankind could do wonders by wishful thinking, make magical unicorns self-multiply every 2 hours (that's not absurd but nonsensical). 

But neither wars nor hunger will end, today or tomorrow, because we won't say so, not really, not like that. Because it's still absurd, even if it's not nonsensical, if it has meaning.

So let's revel on what we said already, what we have right now. It's already quite a lot, when you stop and ponder versus anyone just a century ago and forever before. And let's push the envelope where it matters, baby steps.

World finance is a big *non*-zero sum game, it's literally the blood of modern times, because we say so, and until we make it otherwise (for instance back to a zero-sum game, where your loss is definitely the only way to my win), and shoot everybody else in the foot and heart, like madmen. I'm all for positive pacific revolutions, whether *occupying the 1% of bitcoins in Spring for global healthcare* or whatever. But don't fight smart money. Don't think anyone can wish gravity away like it's some sort of choice, like it's anyone decision. It's not, not really, not like that. 

Lean into it. Learn to appreciate what it means to have smart money versus every single last century in history for the real masses of people (because an alternative world without smart money but without the past is unknown as of yet). You find it awful that it keeps some parts of the world in poverty, but it's so much more complex. It's by definition not a first-world problem and can't be wished away by first-world solutions. Scholars can't solve this one from the comfort of an office in Penn because they're not *over there* changing behaviors.

On the field, it's people like you and me just taking the money because they can, just because we say so. Spend a month, a year in Africa, in Asia, and not just the fancy cities. See the life of ""you's"", there, relatively. See why things are the way they are, and how they could be much worse, and how it's not all related to some wall in some street whether German or American. Removing the blood system for everyone on Earth would be a critical suicide case of ""this is why we can't have nice things"", because some would have drunk the blood when they were not supposed to (*see how all the common imagery fits nicely together? Not me, not my doing, for truth is built-in language so often...*) 

Responsibilities must be enforced however, individually as in any organization, and that is a topic for this century due to inter-dependency.

In principle, smart money is everything but ""people"": smart money never was ""someone"" or ""someone-s"". It's a collective, like the invisible hand of Adam Smith, but less magic, many more hands, and one shady legal persona nonetheless. And hands do *transfers of money*... yes, *that* drift (implicitely so, to keep it civil below). Smart money is why this world can breathe even when it physically can't, as 60% of the world's population is at home and yet the world still keeps happening to a shockingly good extent (all things considered). At any other time in history, it would not have been an option (it is still not, as we speak, in many countries, because people would simply starve in weeks), and that is a testament of some economic might, that I want to consider globally as a species (think less geopolitics and more Kardashiev/Sagan in this perspetive), whatever we politically feel about it, whatever we'd say in a debate of ""should we and how?"", this episode 2020 is definitely a major feat of the human race.

And that was in urgency. Now give it 10 years, and if we do any sort of decent preparation, in terms of infrastructure and knowledge, we could pretty much operate the world while most of us work from home, given the level of technical progress we've achieved. This was the promise of mechanization and machinery all along, right? To be able to just press a button? And wherever that button is, post-internet? (*self-censored bad javascript joke*)

But this event is also proof that some of the richest countries on Earth right now ""can't have too many nice things"" because their economy is profiled in such a way that does not allow for it, even if (some of) their life depended on it (quite literally so I'm afraid). It's a choice, at the very least, to continue in that direction, or not, and the reasons, the hierarchy of values that defines each of us individual and collectively, is much wider than this topic. But ""smart money"" **will be right about it however**, because smart money is what will make ""it"" happen, whatever it [the next new world] happens to be. You don't want to be on the wrong side of that, it's a bit of a historical fork. 

You also should know that in consumerism, voting with a wallet is what ultimately drives smart money;  
that in investing your wallet has 100× more impact on your values regarding the world and moving needles;  
and that in post-internet times your very behavior online is part of that equation as the human kind gets abstracted in big data. Whether your behavior (bots/AI of tomorrow) or your browser history (rest assured that sentiment is meaningful however, it's normal to visit things we have negative feeling about, know thy enemy and all that). The world is nothing but what we make of it, online or not.

Now to address the elephant in any room with ""smart money"".

There never was any formal conspiracy, it's all an informal convergence of interests, no more no less. (not a cataclysm yet, no joke either). Face it, Adam Smith won that battle, because the thing is now so massive and so complex that nobody has a god damn switch to really move it at will (those who do are regulated but in the grander scheme of things... nobody can give ±100% to the S&amp;P over the next 10 years, nobody has that kind of power anymore even as a collective. Kings are truly gone). The invisible hand was a self-fulfilling prophecy, is all. 

It's a form of collective agreement (true, *though distorted*) quite special to our modern era. It's sensible because it empirically prevents upheaval, promotes growth, progress and stability, *within the context of its existence* (no way to affirm this would be true in all external conditions). We learned however that it's important to promote a system that doesn't generate as much inequity, that's apparently the only real cataclysmic part everyone and their mother should be worried about (because it tends to be proven in other sciences that it decreases life expectancy globally, and a slew of other social problems do worse). 

Smart money is all these things, and more. You may have a specific definition today— I'm eager to read some in the commentary —but smart money is a more general idea that predates and outlasts most particular historical snapshots we use to describe it (cue rolling eyes on claims that ""it's all because the Fed"" or this person did this thing with gold... *it matters, a lot* in the short-term, don't miskate my words; but it matters not when you try to navigate this historical period versus *other* historical periods, not knowing what this one actually is but in hindsight, thus the ultimate significance of events).

You don't know that gold will triple in the next 8 years and 10× before 2040.   
You don't know that my predictions are as good as my love for science-fiction (definitely lacking and I blame time). Our knowledge will always be partial, so it's sane to focus on what we know. Smart money knows:

- Reforms will be needed fast before more dire circumstances remove the ""business as usual"" card from the hands of decision-makers (it will happen, whether a really bad virus, a war, natural catastrophe, terrorism.. still 80+ years to go for this century, we've not completed 20% so far). So we have 6-12 years to do the job give or take, and the best will be there by 2023. 

- UBI is basically the conclusion of the Tobin tax that never was, and seems like a decent approach to me (but muh opinion, who cares), if it can be indexed to the financials of its region (fact however, inflation is the big enemy of redistribution, more so than otherwise). I have no idea what smart money thinks, no one does remember, but it's already what European countries do in monetary mass redistributed /GDP per persona, only framed in a much more ""universal"" fin/math way indeed.

- Pushing on virtualization and ""remoting"" humans to increase worldwide collaboration is also a great avenue of improvement (for quality of life, anti-fragility of society, etc) that's been demonstrated as totally feasible within 5 years or so. Collaterally automating big logistics/production centers with non-biologicals (robots, self-sanitizing buildings, etc) is a strong path to a few decades of economic prosperity as we transform infrastructure and eliminate all menial jobs of the 20th century and transition to the next paradigm. Not what I intend to discuss here, it's another topic, but it's really just the right part of the S-curve for this domain now 80 years in the making (see, again, sci-fi for references, if Boston Dynamics isn't enough).

So, smart money. Talking to you know, whether a cog, a hair in the machine, or more figures than my hand has fingers happening to read by. Know what you built, others before you, previous versions of the machine; and know what's left to do, find the best makers of that, and invest on. 

The rest of us, the ""less smart"" I guess, it's pop-corn time for the next decade. Please mind the reapers though, they announce fortunes to be made but tend to leave a lasting mark if you touch one. Happy r/investing.

(but I had moved almost all-in cash *before* the pandemic hit, so I guess I'm not that un-smart after all, I suppose I'm not alone sitting this one out. Such is my skin in the game if you want to weigh this view, as I'm really not just talking). Speaking of which, gotta head back to work. Hope this was at least an entertaining read to whoever made it this far... |"

There are the usual suspects who'll be on it like MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, AMZN. I've looked at semiconductors like AMD, QCOM, NVDA thinking the semiconductor space is big due to compute power requirements.

I feel like I'm sitting in the water waiting for the wave but could be in a better spot."
73,2020-05-06,proust_qt,1,weird AI ETF,"I just found AI ETF (QRFT).

It was listed in NYSE about 1 year ago and their website claims that it would be a good substitute for SPY ETF. 

After 1 year, their total return(including dividend) is really outperforming about 9% over SPY after fee, and the Sharpe ratio is about double. But it seems that none know it.

Does AI really work? It is made by a Korean AI company. How do you think??

74,2020-05-06,niknikniknikniknik1,1,Which markets or industries do you see perform best in the next decades (geographic vs. industry focus vs. cap size)? How do you build this into a strategy and portfolio to maximize expected risk-adjusted future returns?,"I often get confused when people here argue whether one could beat ""the market"". Which ""market"" are they referring to? Assuming Equities, which equities and index? MSCI World? S&amp;P500? FTSE100? ASX200? Emerging markets? 

Many portfolios suggested here seem to suggest a strong U.S. bias for equities, and even an MSCI world would have almost 40% U.S. equity exposure. While it's true that the S&amp;P500 has had strong past returns over many time periods, there's plenty of research suggesting that over the same periods other markets have outperformed.

Let's assume for a minute that ""the market"" is the S&amp;P500 (or MSCI world index, irrelevant for my point). In times of low-cost ETFs widely available and being able to shift the weightings of one's portfolio relatively easily to replicate a strategy, I think it makes sense to compare this reference index and their **risk adjusted returns** to other indices along different dimensions. For equities, the obvious ones are

* **Geographic focus**  
Comparing reference indices in different countries can be an interesting exercise. Quite surprisingly, the Australian, South African, and Swedish stock market have had higher *risk adjusted* returns over different periods (16 years, 40 years, 116 years) than the S&amp;P500.

One might also look into historic performance of emerging markets vs. U.S, Europe or OECD.
* **Company size**  
There's plenty of research suggesting that small caps, at least in certain geographies, have historically outperformed large cap over long periods of time.  
[https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/](https://engineeredportfolio.com/2017/05/13/emerging-market-and-small-cap-outperformance-historical-comparison-of-international-equities/) 
* **Company/market maturity**  
Over the past decade, 'growth' stocks have outperformed 'value'-stocks in the U.S. and other markets. 
* **Sector focus**  
Similarly, if one had put more emphasis on tech (e.g. NASDAQ) and placed their bet on buying QQQ, returns would have significantly higher since the past bull run. 

Now obviously past performance does not predict future returns, but it's one data point and can be considered alongside other factors. These include current valuations of such markets or sectors (particularly when it comes to investing lump sums at a certain point of time) and more importantly larger themes such as changes in political landscapes and the geopolitical environment, climate change and shift towards renewables, urbanization (or de-urbanization due to COVID?), digitization, etc.

With a lot of data on past performance of different indices available and reflecting on major socioeconomic and political trends that will shape our lives in the next decades, I'd be interested in creating a diversified portfolio using low-cost ETFs, which over the next 20-30 years is likely to outperform the classic bogleheads 3-fund portfolio or an MSCI world and potentially offer higher risk-adjusted returns compared to those indices. Suggestions should be evidence-based on a combination of past returns and outlook into the future, rather than saying ""just put your money into FANG or an AI or ROBO-ETF"".

With that in mind, which mix of markets, or sectors, do you see outperforming over the next decades compared to a S&amp;P500 or MSCI world reference index, how would you build a low-cost portfolio based on that strategy, and with which weightings? Let's discuss!"

76,2020-05-05,beekenio,1,"IBM and Red Hat expand their telco, edge and AI enterprise offerings","IBM has struggled to grow its overall revenue in recent years, but has found a winning formula with its Cloud and Cognitive Software division, which provides businesses with hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence capabilities. Revenues from that segment were up 5% year over year in the first quarter, even with the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and that increase followed 8.7% growth in the fourth quarter. \[The Motley Fool\]

“The public clouds do extraordinary things and they’re great partners of ours, but their primary business is creating these homogeneous services, at massive volumes, and saying ‘if your workloads fit into this, we can run it better, faster, cheaper etc.’ And they have obviously expanded out. They’ve added services. They are not saying we can put a box on-premise, but you’re still fitting into their model.” - IBM's President Jim Whitehurst

On the news side, IBM is launching new services to automate business planning, budgeting and forecasting, for example, as well as new AI-driven tools for building and running automation apps that can handle routine tasks either autonomously or with the help of a human counterpart. The company is also launching new tools for call-center automation. \[TC\]

77,2020-05-05,iamre,1,What does everyone think about investing in AI / Robotics?,"There's been a big wave of AI being pushed lately with Smart Homes, Self Driving cars, and many more industries. 

I've noticed a few companies in the fast food industry have already come out with many automated processes for doing things. It seems like these AI / Robots could be very useful in the future, especially when you look at the lack of human workers available during times like this. The big issue I see them having so far is that the cost to buy one of these machines is still very very high and would take a long time to be worth it.

My question is do you guys think now is a good time to invest in these companies while their stocks are still low or wait a few years for them to work out the bugs, become more cost effective, and start becoming more mainstream. I think these machines will eventually replace the human workers in many industries like fast food, question is when do you think that  will happen and when do you think a good time to invest would be?
