This sensation to put a huge bet on the market, against my best judgements.

I want to throw money on hardware companies because of how software is forcing most computer functionality to become commoditized.

What does this mean?

Well cloud computing is basically we take all the data and processing out of the office and throw it at some server at god knows where and we just send commands to it to tell it to do whatever the hell we want the powerful server there to do.

Software makes all of this work. (Google enterprise services or MS enterprise services paired with ERP/CRM software.)

Then the short term demand for hardware will be hammered down. Large companies don't need to spend hundreds of millions on drives/engineers/cards. The clientel will literally just vanish overnight (it's happening). The customer base becomes smaller, but who's he one setting up all the cloud servers? Just a few companies, who'll they buy from? Only the best of the hardware industry.

NVDIA, INTEL, WESTERN DIGITAL, and CISCO. And with the way how each of these companies are behaving to lock their own shiny gardens. They'll win the giant trend shift as their respective industries literally go to hell.

Yeah I know peripherals exist, but fuck them, their industry in general is going to hell due to mobile devices.

I'm very serious in throwing half or 30% of my portfolio in these companies. I don't think they are as replaceable as software companies.

Edit: I'm following up on this post because I think I made every think I'm only looking at the application of hardware as in data centers. Nope, that's not the only place I'm thinking about where this tech can be applied.

I believe that the way how we design each and everything in society is preparing for a huge change. Manufacturing will become much more dispersed by 3D printing devices and more and more automated heavy machinery. More and more public infrastructure will apply more complex algorithms/programs that require high processing capacity. Not just for shipping, but water/electric distribution. Farming will become much more automated than it is now and will require a much higher necessity to process supply/demand data. Transportation is going to face a crisis of declining traffic and adopt tech or die.

This is all just a bet that is against my better judgement. And no, I don't care about your shitty data centers. What I do care about is how ubiquitous high speed Internet access will be in the future."

Hello again, 

A few days ago I submitted a half-brained post about the Ethereum blockchain that I felt did a *huge disservice* to a project that many in the tech world see similarities to that of what was happening in the days of the early 90s Internet in Silicon Valley. 

Since the inception of its whitepaper, many folks have been investing there time &amp; energy into developing potential uses case for the Ethereum network - such as decentralized cloud computing, resource sharing (Transgrid),  swarm intelligence/action/organizational networks (Backfeed, Colony), oracles (Oraclize), prediction markets (Augur, Gnosis), decentralized Reddit (Akasha), decentralized IoT, Smart city backbone, decentralized Voting systems (very timely ;), even a Supercomputer (Golem) built on the blockchain, and **so so much more**.  

Since Ethereum's blockchain coding language, Solidity, is Turing-complete, we cannot fully understand the complexity and scope of use cases that will come about from all the synergy of these decentralized applications and smart contracts.  Please take a look at some of these DEVCON2 (Annual Ethereum development conference) videos and all the development going on in this blockchain 2.0 space.  

I had posted the wrong link for Devcon2 videos in that previous post as well.  My apologies. See the link above for the corrected link.

# Description

Alibaba Group is engaged in online and mobile commerce. It provides retail and wholesale marketplaces available through both personal computer and mobile interfaces in the PRC and internationally. 

Retail marketplaces and services operated by the Company include the China online shopping destination (Taobao Marketplace); the China brands and retail platform (Tmall); the China group buying site that offers products by aggregating demand from consumers through limited time discounted sales (Juhuasuan), and the global consumer marketplace targeting consumers (AliExpress).

In a rough comparison you could say it's like Amazon. Though I get the impression it's not an entirely fair comparison. Why? They also have a relationship with the ""Paypal"" of China, Alipay. Where they will be entitled to a big cash payment if &amp; when it IPOs.

## Recent financials 

They report in RMB/Yuan, So beware the table! The last figure is in US$ 

|Year to March |2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|US$|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | RMB 35bn | RMB 53bn | RMB 76bn | RMB 101bn | US$ 16bn|
|EPS | RMB 3.57 | RMB 10.0 | RMB 9.7 | RMB 27.9 | $4.33|

* What's the revenue split? 83% is the China e-commerce business. 8% international commerce. 3% cloud computing and 6% is other.
* Where's the growth? Well, in the last year the business added RMB 25 bn in sales. With 90% of the growth coming from the domestic e-commerce business...

So frankly, it's a China China China story. And not a lot else.

## Competition

In the same why that Amazon is fighting Google, Facebook and Wal-mart. Alibaba has the domestic equivalents, like Tencent, JD.com and Baidu to fight with.

It's margins and returns are pretty good compared with the domestic peers and versus the global ""big daddy"" Amazon they are *sweet*.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd | $16,804M | 36% | 24%
China based |  |  | 
Tencent Holdings Ltd | $15,300M | 42% | 29%
Baidu Inc (ADR) | $10,578M | 20% | 44%
Weibo Corp (ADR) | $501M | 13% | 7%
JD.Com Inc(ADR) | $32,392M | 0% | -ve
International |  |  | 
Facebook Inc | $22,160M | 49% | 13%
Alphabet Inc | $81,761M | 33% | 15%
Apple Inc. | $220,288M | 34% | 38%
Amazon.com, Inc. | $120,637M | 9% | 14%

In fact it is fair to say the core margin is understated, as their cloud computing, innovations divisions and affiliates are currently loss making. 

## Cash / Debt?

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has $1,259M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 0% of the market value of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. So nothing doing here.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $113.03 for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 11% to their target.

# Valuation

Looking at valuation, at 31x forecast earnings, it's hardly sticker shock. The growth rates are good, their domestic position looks strong, and there's no signs of economic stress in China. Okay, they'd don't own WeChat, which gets columns of press in the west, but who cares! It's still a major success story.

AMZN.O | $390,144M | 140x | 44% | 0% | 2%

# Dividends

No surprise that the $BABA is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Though they do have a share buyback program and did acquire over $2bn of stock last year.

# Yahoo! Softbank and the Cayman Islands

The leading Japanese tech company Softbank owns 32% and the ex-leader Yahoo! owns 12%. I've no idea what their long term views are on the stock, but with Yahoo! carving itself up, there has to be some sort of corporate action / overhang coming in the medium term.

Lastly, when you buy BABA you are actually buying shares in a Cayman Island company. BABA conducts its businesses primarily through its subsidiaries and *variable interest entities*. 

&gt; ""variable interest entities"" are to our variable interest entities that are 100% owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned by PRC citizens, where applicable, that hold the Internet content provider licenses, or ICP licenses, or other business operation licenses or approvals, and generally operate the various websites for our Internet businesses or other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited, and are consolidated into our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP as if they were our wholly-owned subsidiaries

So in reality you aren't actually the legal owner of the underlying businesses, as Chinese regulations don't allow foreigners have these licenses!

It's a flag, a big one, but at the same time, even if you did have legal title in China, how'd you actually enforce it? 

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 23% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. That's against the backdrop of 60% increase in sales in the latest quarter.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they reiterated their 49% forecasts for sales growth this year, highlighted the continued great margin at the core, and the investments they are making for the future. 

So despite the hype that WeChat is becoming *the* Internet in China, there's no sign that it's hurting Alibaba's core business.

# Description
salesforce.com, inc. is a provider of enterprise cloud computing solutions, with a focus on customer relationship management (CRM). The Company's Customer Success Platform, including sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, community management, analytics, application development, etc. 

So why buy Twitter? Here's that [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-m-a-salesforce-com-idUSKCN12A2B2) says:

&gt; Unlike Twitter, its main product is aimed at business users, not consumers. Under Salesforce.com, Twitter could become a corporate tool used to power sentiment analysis and nurture customer relationships.

Now odd that that might seem, remember that we the user of Google are not the ""customers"". The advertisers are the customers. So perhaps there is method in the madness?

## Recent financials 

It's really hard to not be impressed by a top line like CRM's! And given it's a ""cloud"" business with a ""SaaS"" model, the momentum should run. Why? folks are signing up for monthly subscriptions and they just seem to never go cancelling them in the software space.

|Jan year-end |2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6.7bn | $5.4bn | $4.1bn | $3.1bn | $2.3bn|
|EPS | -$0.07 | -$0.42 | -$0.39 | -$0.48 | -$0.02|

Of course, it's troubling that the company hasn't turned a profit in the last 5 years, but here's to a first in the year to Jan 2017!

## Competition

Talking about the competition, Salesforce highlights:

&gt; We compete primarily with generalized platforms and vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps, including CRM, collaboration and business intelligence software. We also compete with internally developed apps. We may encounter competition from established enterprise software vendors, as well as start-up and midsized companies focused on disruption, who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services. 

Though one of the competitive risks they highlight is actual a strength of there own!

&gt; Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service.

i.e. like a lot of software based services, once you've got the client they are loathed to leave.

And how does this show on in the financials, well the old men of Enterprise technology (MSFT, ORCL, SAP) enjoy little growth but great returns and margins. But the new kids, CRM, WDAY, NOW have the growth but little margin or return.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
salesforce.com, inc. | $7,475M | 8% | 4%
Microsoft Corporation | $85,320M | 33% | 22%
Oracle Corporation | $37,194M | 42% | 19%
SAP SE (ADR) | $23,533M | 32% | 16%
Intuit Inc. | $4,694M | 32% | 46%
Workday Inc | $1,352M | -15% | -31%
ServiceNow Inc | $1,194M | -8% | -117%

## Cash / Debt?

If we look at salesforce's balance sheet we can see it has $1,340M of net debt. That is 2.2x it's latest operating profit. So it's a $50bn market value business with quite a bit of debt on it's books and it's considering a bid for TWTR a $13bn value business (though $2bn of that is cash).

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $93.51 for salesforce.com, inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 29% to their target.

# Valuation

I've always struggled to value the highflying SaaS businesses. The regular metrics just don't give any comfort. And if I switch to price-to-sales I still get faced with CRM on 6x forward sales versus MSFT/ORCL on 4x. So where's the comfort there?

And I can't even hang my hat on the earnings the year after next :( With a [forecast](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=CRM.N) of $0.95 this year and just $1.27 the year after. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/crm/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
CRM | $49,608M | 76x | 30% | 0% | 1%
MSFT.O | $445,654M | 20x | 9% | 3% | 8%
ORCL.K | $156,056M | 14x | 8% | 2% | 9%
SAP | $110,016M | 21x | 11% | 1% | 6%
INTU.O | $27,597M | 25x | 17% | 1% | 5%
WDAY.K | $17,570M | -ve | 38% | 0% | -ve
NOW | $12,963M | 120x | 44% | 0% | -ve

To try and justify the valuation you need to dig into the cashflow statement and drink from the SaaS KoolAid. For example on the managements 2Q results they talked about:

&gt; our full year operating cash flow guidance to a year-over-year growth rate of 20% to 21% which allows us to remain on track for our first $2 billion cash flow year. 

Now 25x cashflow doesn't look ""hideous"" for a business growing like CRM... but if you start looking at the way that figure is calculated, I expect you'll be surprised to see Depreciation &gt; capex, half of the figure coming in deferred revenue, and a substantial % from stock-options-plan adjustments.

# Dividends
You won't be surprised that salesforce.com, inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. 

Though in share contrast to the big caps who like doing share buybacks, the number of share in circulation at CRM is up substantially in each of the last 5 years. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -11% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. The backdrop has been continued double digit top line growth at 26% in the first 6 months.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they raised guidance for sales, expressed confidence in their margin, spoke of an exciting new set of products (e.g. Einstein), strong cashflows and much more.

In the near-term it's hard to see any catalyst other than the rumor mill round Twitter. And binary outcomes are a horrible environment to take a position in. You'll either feel like a hero or get hammered. 

For me, it's one to sit out. Unless of course the stock get's hammered, with investors throwing the baby out with the bathwater!

# Description

They've a rather grand vision of themselves

&gt; We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. 

So what does that mean? 

Amazon.com, Inc. offers a range of products and services through its Websites. Both products it purchases for resale and products offered by 3rd parties. It's got 3 divisions:

* North America
* International
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

So we all know the amazon.com service, but what's AWS? Well as a start-up, Stockflare's built upon AWS. And surprisingly some of Amazon's competitors, like Netflix also store all their mission critical code on AWS servers! AWS allows anyone launch an online service without owning severs themselves. Nice eh? Wait until you see the margin. :)

And when it comes to innovation... well there is AWS okay, then there is the Kindle, and Amazon Prime, and Amazon Local, and Originals,  etc etc...so the Bezos vision... of the ""Everything Store"" is coming together!

## Recent financials 

THe growth is shocking, in a good way. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $107bn | $89bn | $74bn | $61bn | $48bn|
|EPS | $1.25 | -$0.52 | $0.59 | -$0.09 | $1.37|

And for 2016 the forecast is sales of $137bn.

When it comes to profit's it's sort of *funny*, as it's AWS that turns a profit, with the North America and International divisions flip in and out of profit. Yes, they are investing, I know. Here's the first 9 months of 2016:

|9M 2016|Sales|Operating Profit| % |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|North America | $53.5bn | $1.5bn | 3% | 
|International | $30.0bn | -$0.8bn | -ve | 
|AWS | $8.7bn | $2.2bn | 25% |

## Competition

The competition section of their annuals rather funny, as they say pretty much everyone is their competitor, though they divide them into 7 groups:

1. all retailers
2. publishers, producers, media distributors of all distribution channels
3. search engines &amp; social networks
4. e-commerce companies
5. fulfilment &amp; logistics 
6. cloud computing IT firms
7. electronic device manufacturers

But to keep our lives simple, let's look at retail-first and digital-first competitors.

At a glance the margin looks good relative to WMT and COST. Though quite a bit behind HD. 

Given the structure of it's business I can't see it ever getting to Google of Netflix's margins, though if we look at the margins of AWS they aren't as good as the digital competitors, though it's not a fair comparison since they are not infrastructure based IT services companies. Though [Rackspace](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/rax/breakdown/latest) has a 32% margin v 25% for AWS.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Amazon.com, Inc. | $127,993M | 9% | 14%
Retail-First | | | 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | $484,604M | 7% | 18%
Home Depot Inc | $93,368M | 16% | 116%
Costco Wholesale Corporation | $118,719M | 4% | 21%
Digital-First | | | 
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd | $18,163M | 36% | 15%
Alphabet Inc | $85,537M | 33% | 15%
Netflix, Inc. | $8,176M | 59% | 7%
eBay Inc | $8,906M | 34% | 28%

However, given Bezos' vision and his focus on being always cheaper it's not impossible that they shall always have a slightly lower margin than their competitors. But if the top line's good, well who cares!

## Cash / Debt?

Amazon.com, Inc. has $10,142M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 3% of the market value of Amazon.com, Inc. so if they woke up one day and decided to buy Snapchat from under Zuckerberg's nose it wouldn't be hard to do!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $922.38 for Amazon.com, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 18% to their target.

# Valuation

It's really hard to see the logic behind that $920 price target. It's clearly not PE driven...however, if you look at price to sales, and say that AMZN's current 2.6x forecast sales will rise to the sector average of 3.2x sales, then sure!

But frankly, I find it hard to believe that these metrics are really anything more than a place to hang your emotional belief in Bezos.

# Dividends

Amazon.com, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. The company hasn't ever paid one. And although they have a 6 year old authorisation to buy back stock, they rarely do it. In effect... it's invest invest invest at Amazon.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -17%. Wow. Obviously at 160x this years earnings, the EPS figure is irrelevant today. In fact, perhaps the key is the believe in 2017 and beyond. For example the current forecast is for sales to grow 20%+ and earnings to double.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they were tight lipped about 2017 and it's funny that anytime someone highlighted a potential negative, e.g. lower margins in International, the immediate response is ""we are investing"".

So, I suppose the history of them investing is pretty consistent, and to date their investment has continued to drive topline growth, impressively. They are bigger than HD and COST now in terms of sales. It would be a brave person to bet they won't be larger than Wal-Mart in the next 20 years. Maybe 10 years?

Of course, that won't stop the stock periodically dropping $100-150 a share when the market loses confidence in AMZN, though it appears to typically be temporary *lovers' tiffs*. 

For now, I think I'll await the next tiff.
