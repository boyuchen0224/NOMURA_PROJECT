&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Apple Inc. plans to launch iPhones with a more-powerful 3-D camera as soon as next year, stepping up the company’s push into augmented reality, according to people familiar with the plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The rear-facing, longer-range 3-D camera is designed to scan the environment to create three-dimensional reconstructions of the real world. It will work up to about 15 feet from the device, the people said. That’s in contrast with the current iPhone 3-D camera system, which points toward users and operates at distances of 25 to 50 centimeters to power Apple’s Face ID facial-recognition feature.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s new system uses a laser scanner, rather than the existing dot-projection technology which doesn’t work as well over longer distances, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unreleased features. That’s just one of many new features -- including a third, more advanced camera, enhanced photo-capture tools and a more powerful chip -- that Apple plans to include in coming generations of iPhones, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The laser-powered 3-D camera would enhance augmented reality on the iPhone, allowing for more accurate depth perception and placement of virtual objects. It could also help the handset take photos that can better capture depth, the people said. Apple has been in talks with Sony Corp. about testing sensors for the new system, one of the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;While virtual reality immerses the user in a digital realm, AR overlays visuals and data onto a view of the real world. Use cases include looking at a building and displaying details of the structure beside the image, or listing repair instructions for a mechanic while she works on a defective machine. It’s been touted as having wider mass-market appeal than VR, and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has talked up its prospects.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 2020 iPhone camera may be a prelude to an AR headset that Apple has been preparing for as early as 2020. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s plans, which could change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple previously aimed to put the new 3-D camera system on the back of this year’s high-end iPhones, but delayed that, the people familiar also said. Still, the Cupertino, California-based technology giant is doubling down on camera capabilities for its handsets.  
&gt;  
&gt;For 2019, Apple plans successors to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max -- code-named D42 and D43 -- and an update to the iPhone XR, said the people. The larger of the new high-end iPhones will have three cameras on the back, and other handsets could eventually come with the upgraded system, too, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Cameras have become one of the most-important features in a saturated smartphone market. Better photos are a compelling reason for people to upgrade their handsets, especially when other new capabilities are either harder to design or too wonky for most customers to appreciate. Apple pioneered smartphone camera improvements, which over the years have included additions like Portrait Mode. Rivals have tried to catch up, with Samsung Electronics Co. launching phones with as many as four outward-facing cameras last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The iPhone still generates the majority of Apple’s revenue, although sales of the devices fell last year as people upgraded less often. That triggered a stock slump that wiped more than $300 billion off the company’s market value since October. New models with more-capable cameras could spur upgrades and reignite Apple’s growth, making these upcoming iPhones the most critical in years.  
&gt;  
&gt;A third camera on the back of the 2019 iPhone will help the device capture a larger field of view and enable a wider range of zoom. It will also capture more pixels so Apple software could, for example, automatically repair a video or photo to fit in a subject that may have been accidentally cut off from the initial shot, according to the people familiar with the plans. The company is also planning an enhanced version of its Live Photos feature, which pins video from before and after each shot to the photo. The new version will double the length of the video from three seconds to six seconds.  
&gt;  
&gt;The laser-powered 3-D camera could debut first on an upgrade to the iPad Pro currently planned for as early as spring 2020, according to one of the people. Apple isn’t expected to release a major iPad Pro update this year like it did in 2018. It typically upgrades the line in the second half of the year. Apple in the past has launched major new features on the iPad before the iPhone, including 4G internet connectivity in 2012.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple is also testing some versions of this year’s iPhone line that includes a USB-C connector instead of the Lightning port that has been used on iPhones since 2012, indicating that the company plans an eventual switch, according to one of the people. Moving to USB-C would make the new models compatible with chargers used for hundreds of other devices, like Android phones.  
&gt;  
&gt;This year’s iPhone models will include an upgraded Apple processor and use an updated Face ID sensor for unlocking the device and approving payments, the people said. The handsets will otherwise look similar to the current models with larger changes expected as early as 2020 to accommodate plans for 5G networking capabilities, Bloomberg News reported last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Beyond iPhones, Apple plans to release an updated version of its lower-cost iPad with a roughly 10-inch screen and a faster processor as early as this spring, according to people familiar with the plans. That device is expected to retain the Lightning port, according to one of the people. The company is also readying a new, cheaper iPad mini, its smallest tablet that hasn’t been updated since 2015, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s next operating system update, iOS 13, will include a dark mode option for easier nighttime viewing and improvements to CarPlay, the company’s in-vehicle software. There will also be iPad-specific upgrades like a new home screen, the ability to tab through multiple versions of a single app like pages in a web browser, and improvements to file management. The company will also integrate two new services, including a magazine subscription service and its original video content efforts, via iOS updates this year.   
&gt;  
&gt;Each year since 2012, Apple has launched its latest iPhone in September. The one exception was the iPhone X’s November release in 2017."
1,2019-01-06,SuchRush,1,"Long FB, the God of Virtual Reality","Fair enough, I think that the fact that:

People have to invest in a particular brand app store will make the products very sticky. ( Not going to buy a HTC Shadow 2 over an Oculus Quest 2, when the Oculus Quest 2 can play my $1000+ Oculus Quest 1 library,  and the Shadow can't)

The price of HMDs will make it unlikely that most  people will purchase more than one

There should be a limited amount of platforms that recieve developer attention, based on the number of users on the platforms. Both the number and quality of apps will fall into a liminted number of ecosystems at best.

As a result it will limit the amount of app stores that can be successful, much like the smart phone, or gaming console market today. I see little competition for FB outside of Sony (and Sony competes only in the demographic that has Playstations) in near term VR. I don't see Valve as a serious long term competitor, but if they are it will be in high end PC VR, which is a small niche market. I see VR developing into a market with very little competition amongst a few app ecosystems. Facebook/Oculus is years ahead on research over the competition, creating better products, at cheaper prices, and with better marketing. This will allow them to capture market share, and lock consumers in early on. Margins in this business will be sustainably high, as evident in Android or Apple app stores "

I like BYND. I love the burger, the concept, the plan for the future and the aggressive drive to market this FAD-FOOD in as many modern restaurants and locales as possible. I even love the fact that local restaurants are ordering these burgers on their own so that they can purposely charge an exorbitant ""hipster tax"" because it shows that the BYND plan and Capitalism are both alive. Can't eat green burgers without green paper.

I have loved the concept of farming practices over herding since I was a child and to see it come to such delicious fruition in my lifetime makes me a happy consumer. I want BYND and every company like them to succeed. But as a child I was also enamored and blinded with the promise of VR only to get given the Virtual Boy. I was taught to treat business as a serious institution and as a young adult failed to heed my gut instincts on a random investment because at the time no respectable company would call themselves ""Google"". Dumb shit plagues my cash flow and my best intentions.

Optimism in a company drives its valuation like farting into the mainsail (except Tesla, wtf). There seems to be a marginal population of the ""Stock Gnats"" that are abuzz with foretold failings of my beloved fresh IPO. I've heard snippets of concerns about everything from ""Ain't nobody replacing muh cows"" to ""lack of specific crop availability"" to ""serious overvaluation"" and even ""Elevated glyphosate levels"" fear-mongering and I'm caught between a Stock and hard place.

This IS a good thing, right? For the world and our future? This is the type of things we're supposed to be INVESTING our money into to improve upon our future foundation, correct? Won't somebody please tell me how to spend my money responsibly?

tl;dr Let's put together a good Pro's and Con's list about BYND that I can eventually replace the GWOT above with for the betterment of some of mankind."

20 years ago MSFT was also number one company by market cap in the world followed by a relatively diverse group of ""old-money"" companies like GE, oil/gas companies, Coca-Cola etc. 

Given the acceleration of ""tech companies"" over the past 20 years allowing the other three to join Microsoft in being the biggest, is there any reason to think they'll lose momentum any time in the near or long future to another industry?

Any futuristic fields like AI/AR/VR that are gaining momentum will either be dominated via the big 4/5, or by a start-up that's inevitably absorbed by one of the big 4/5--and at this point in time it's hard to imagine a separate industry, whether or not it exists today overtaking what we have in place for technology today.

Compared to the past dominant industries, e.g. telecommunications, oil/gas, banking, health care, even without the aid of hindsight it seems like there was eventually a peak there, or potential for a new industry to come in. But for me it's hard to see with 'technology' as it is today."

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/adobe-earnings-q2-2019.html


Signs of some slowdown in certain areas, but this behemoth continues to move in the right direction. 


""Adobe’s largest business segment, Digital Media, which includes the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud products, produced $1.89 billion in revenue, up 22% and above the $1.86 billion consensus estimate""


Adobe’s stock is up 22% so far in 2019 which is impressive given the fear led dips we've had. There are companies coming out with individual products that might be better than their specific rival that adobe produces (figma vs Adobe xd for example), but no one is even close to producing a suite of tools to match what creative cloud can cover. 

The only way I could see a slowdown is if smart phones get so good that photographers no longer buy separate cameras. This could then lead to users sticking with iOS or Android editing tools instead of Lightroom / Photoshop... but that's a serious stretch and not something that will happen soon.

Maybe if they drop the ball on VR when that becomes mainstream?"
5,2019-07-16,longtermthrowaway02,0,A basic explanation/guide on 5G,"An in depth guide on 5G

What is 5G:

5G is the fifth generation cellular network technology. The industry association 3GPP defines any system using ""5G NR"" software as ""5G"", a definition that came into general use by late 2018. 


Why is 5G useful? How much better is it than 4G?:

Theoretically 5G at maximum potential is roughly 100 times faster than 4G, this is useful for downloading and processing information. This is in theory of course, 5G by 2020 shouldn’t be even close to this level but it’s realistic to expect 5G to be over 20 times faster than 4G. It promises mobile data speeds that far outstrip the fastest home broadband network.


Home broadband internet vs 5G:

Eventually The classic broadband internet will be replaced by 5G as its multiple times faster.


What technology’s will implement 5G technology?:

Tons of technology’s are implementing 5G such as, remote surgery; 5G networks essentially mean a patient doesn’t need to be in the same room as a surgeon for surgery, simply using vr technology, robotics and 5G.

Self driving cars will also be 100% 5G powered, many in the industry don't believe a fully autonomous vehicle is possible without a 5G network.

Drones:

Similarly, 5G will unlock the true capability of drones. Lynn Comp, director of market development at Intel, cited the example of a drone flying over an oil drill with a video camera. The network will allow for precise control of the drone, while sending back high-definition video.

Virtual reality:

5G heavily enables virtual reality to advance to the next level, Sprint Chief Operating Officer Gunther Ottendorfer said he expects to see a return of game arcades -- but focused on virtual reality.




Great 5G is substantially useful what stocks should I invest in/who’s winning:

Currently China is winning the 5G race, its carriers have promised to create fully operation commercial networks by 2020, and in total they’ve outspent the US by approximately 24 billion dollars.
China has a significant advantage as they have built 350 thousand 5G enabled cell towers where as us only has built 30 thousand in the same time range.
Japan is also a significant contender matching up with China, So for now it seems Asia as a continent will get 5G before USA.


The US has stopped supplying huawei with chips in hope that it stops china from winning the race.


The major stocks involved in us should be sprint with its merge with t mobile merger if it gets accepted, and also at&amp;t, Verizon is also another contender albeit there’s less headlines with them and 5G. The merger between t mobile and sprint has already passed through quite a bit and experts agree that it’s most likely going to be accepted.

Sorry if the formatting looks hideous.

6,2019-07-13,bolyus21,1,Mapping Out Some Collateral Developments to Blockchain Technology,"Guest Blogger: *Andrew Rossow, Esq.*

Every once and while, a new technology comes around that positively impacts innovation in several fields, even some outside of its initially intended sector. Blockchains, more specifically Bitcoin, is increasingly showing the signs of doing the very same.

From the expansion and further development of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) (ZKPs) to [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#can-snarks-and-starks-help), a seemingly golden age of cryptography, improved privacy, and permissionless financial products have branched out from Bitcoin’s meteoric rise.

ZKPs and a New Era of Privacy

Obviously central to the name “cryptocurrencies,” is the cryptography component that underpins Bitcoin’s transaction scheme and that of the many altcoins. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, which is becoming increasingly clear with the likes of blockchain forensics companies emerging left and right — attracting government support in the process.

However, that realization has led to some fascinating downstream effects in the development of better cryptography.

For example, research into a full-scale implementation of Schnorr Signatures, widely considered to be the best cryptographic signature primitive, [recently materialized](https://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-releases-test-code-for-bitcoin-tech-upgrade-schnorr) into a formal proposal for inclusion into Bitcoin. Dubbed, “MuSig,” Schnorr Signatures would confer better scalability and privacy to the legacy cryptocurrency.

But the innovation does not stop there.

Out of the demand for anonymity came altcoins like Monero and ZCash, predicated on novel cryptographic techniques for completely masking the identities of users and the amounts transferred.

For example, Monero, a “CryptoNote Coin,” leverages the power of ring signatures — a technique for obfuscating the originator of a signed digital message that has been around for years but never applied on the scale as it is with Monero.

Researchers even released a new implementation of formalized ring signatures for enhanced privacy, called [OmniRing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/buumwj/omniring_scaling_up_private_payments_without/), designed to scale up privacy transactions without the feared “trusted setup.” Similarly, the production of “[Bulletproofs](https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/)” out of the famed Stanford Applied Cryptography Group enhanced the efficiency of privacy-preserving transactions, which have historically been data-heavy.

The concept builds on the notion of ZKPs, which have attracted the nickname of “crypto magic” for being unfathomably complex from a mathematical perspective while furnishing near-complete anonymity.

All of these developments, while built on technologies preceding Bitcoin, have accelerated over the last few years. Even banks, like JP Morgan, are joining in on the fun, building their own implementations of ZKPs for private transactions.

The snowballing innovation in the field of cryptography comes at an opportune time. Once hailed by cypherpunks as the [last vestige of hope](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/) against a surveillance state, cryptography is a powerful shield against the repeated data malpractice of tech firms and government snooping.

What began as an era of openly sharing on social media platforms, has spun into a complicated mix of wanting social media but without corporations and governments having access to the data — privacy is now at a premium.

Distributed Computing — Scaling Decentralized Networks

Similar to the rise in cryptography over the last several years, there has been an explosion in distributed computing, particularly scaling decentralized networks. Emerging out of the need for public, permissionless blockchain networks (i.e., Ethereum) to scale better, a confluence of efficiency improvements and innovative technologies are seeking to power public blockchains with the same performance level as their centralized counterparts.

For example, the concept of *sharding* — horizontally partitioning a database — has gained prominence among several platforms, including Ethereum, as a way to enable groups (i.e., shards) of nodes process transactions in parallel. Ethereum’s foray into sharding is known as its Serenity upgrade, which is pending rollout following more extensive research and testing of the underlying concept.

Other projects, like [Elrond](https://elrond.com/), are pushing the envelope even farther. Elrond is working on a bleeding-edge form of state sharding known as “Adaptive State Sharding” in conjunction with their secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Compared to the other forms of sharding, transaction and network, state sharding is the most technically complex and widely considered to have enormous potential in boosting the performance of public blockchains. Elrond implements all three in an ambitious take on scaling decentralized networks.

Take the case of Elrond, whose [Testnet](https://testnet.elrond.com/#/) is already live, and has reached a peak performance capacity of nearly 12,000 transactions per second (TPS). For context, Ethereum’s current iteration process roughly 15 – 20 TPS.

Sharding, similar to the aforementioned privacy technologies, is not a new concept either. Sharding is prevalent for improving database efficiency and has been around for many years. It is only recently that it began garnering attention in crypto circles as a method to improve the scalability of decentralized networks.

The sheer scale of development of sharding applied to distributed networks is nothing short of impressive so far.

The convergence of technologies like sharding with new consensus designs, like PoS, is sure to usher in a new generation of blockchains, supplemented by better privacy and scalability. It is not surprising that such developments have flown under the radar, as they are highly esoteric, but their downstream advantages for mainstream consumers and app users are promising.

Bitcoin may have birthed a spectacular invention of money, but its collateral effects in the form of distributed computing and cryptography may come to have a more dynamic impact on society than a P2P digital currency.

As today’s mobile phones are not yet powerful enough to run complex programs, NetVRk’s mobile app will have less features, but will allow its users to connect with other users across all platforms, and communicate through a voice/chat interface very much like with the successful title “Fortnite”, which enables its users to interact with other gamers using a variety of media and operating systems. In the near future when 5G, the fifth generation of cellular mobile communications technology, will be implemented across all mobile networks and when phones will be more powerful, users will be able to access all NetVRk features from their mobile phones.

This was prompted by watching Eric Weinstein's episode on the [Great Stagnation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s). There are similar thinkers out there such as [Tyler Cowen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_93CXTt2K7c&amp;t=322s). The conclusion from both of them is that there's been no real core innovation in society for the last 50 years. This leaves the question, how do companies expand wealth in a period where they're producing nothing new? And what should you invest in if we're living through The Great Stagnation? I see several options. They are all ""bullshit"" in the sense that they're ""non-innovative"" but some are more reliable than others.

First you have pseudo innovation in most of Silicon Valley. ""Juicero"" and ""Theranos"" come to mind. This is only worth investing in if you're on the ground floor and can screw other people before they realize you're screwing them. Basically legal scams.

Second in a society where wealth isn't expanding this means wealth will polarize. Because if you can't create new wealth you're only option left is to steal other people's pie pieces. This results in most people living materially worse and becoming increasingly miserable. There will be more deaths of despair. The US life expectancy rate has dropped for the last couple of years. So how do you make money here? You invest in drugs or drug like experiences that allow people to escape their shitty lives at low cost. So oxy, marijuana, [virtual reality](https://drmarkgriffiths.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/vr-addiction-1444927129-wpbo-full-width-inline.jpg).

Third, labor reduction through legal slavery aka outsourcing or automation.

Fourth, [consolidation](http://i.imgur.com/Kh2FL.jpg).
