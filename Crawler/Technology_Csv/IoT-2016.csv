Altria, Intel (solid room for growth with the IoT PLUS dividend), and NAT - fuel prices are giving them even MORE business(officially yielding a 13.4% dividend, up from 13.2- and a total steal at it's current price) all the way.

Aapl dissapointed me with my biggest losses, however Facebook more than made up for it."

6,2016-07-11,AboveBeyond14240,3,IBM vs HP-Enterprise (HPE) vs Cisco,"Which one do you like more and why?

I like IBM for Watson cog and I feel like they are just making good choices that will give them a competitive advantage in the long run. For example they purchased the Weather company and they are trying to feed all that weather data into Watson to help predict the weather more accurately. Now I was just at the airport and my plane was delayed for 12 hours and then cancelled because of bad weather. If IBM figures that out they can help airports better prepare for storms like that so last minute delays aren't an issue. 

I realize they have hardware sales constantly dropping and this offsets the growth from their 'strategic imperatives', but at some point they will hit a growth phase and I see that continuing. 

HPE - they are already in the growth phase...they don't have a hardware segment that's eating at their profits like cisco or ibm. They are also planning a merger with CSC which I don't know much about but seems promising from what I read.  

What I don't like is that the CTO working on 'the machine' is leaving at the end of the year. For those that don't know this machine is supposed to revolutionize the way data centers operate. The fact that the main lead on the project is leaving doesn't show much confidence in it's success. 

 Cisco - I have done much less research but they seem similar to IBM but without the ruthlessness to lose the dead-weight and a future competitive advantage other then the hardware know how for IoT switches(which I believe have been dropping in sales) but they also have a large cash horde so....idk. 

This is what I think ..IBM has longer history and I feel like once they are finished with this transformation they will hit high speed growth and see a massive jump in share price. I think that may be a little longer away, where as HPE I think will start seeing growth in the short run and kind of dwindle away as they don't seem to have any distinct advantages over IBM as far as I can tell, unless this machine turns out to be legit. 

These are all my opinions and I'm no expert so feel free to tear my theories apart lol what do you all think? I think if I had to rank them by my favorite it would be ibm &gt; cisco &gt; hpe"
7,2016-08-11,shane_stockflare,15,stockAday: Fitbit forgot? $FIT,"# Key Stats for Fitbit Inc

Oh no... another tech IPO that didn't shine :( $FIT IPOed at $20, ramping to nearly $48 and now it's at $15, with some of the insiders *dumping* stock at $29 when the lock-ups expired.

So have the IPO luvies capitulated and forgotten about $FIT, now that more than 12 months have past?

# Description
Fitbit is a provider of health and fitness devices. The Company's platform combines connected health and fitness devices with software and services, including an online dashboard and mobile applications, data analytics, motivational and social tools, personalized insights and virtual coaching through customized fitness plans and interactive workouts. 

## Recent financials 

So the year to 2015 was a phenomenon with sales nearly tripling. And the 1st half of 2016 hasn't been shoddy either, with sales up to $1.1bn from $0.7bn in first half 2015. They sold 10.5m devices too. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1.9bn | $0.7bn | $0.3bn | $0.1bn | $0.01bn|
|EPS | $0.75 | $0.63 | -$1.32 | -$0.11 | -$0.12|

And the operational metrics are impressive too.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Devices sold | 21m | 11m | 4m | 1m | 0.2m|
|Active users | 17m | 7m | 3m | N/A | N/A|

But clearly with the stock down so much you'd imagine they've been missing their quarterly numbers? Well, no! Consensus is for sales of $2.6bn for the year (no change in the forecast in last couple months) and EPS not budged either. Oh... how sentiment can kill. Perhaps the $GPRO debacle overshadows them?

## Competition

From their annual:

&gt; The market for connected health and fitness devices is both evolving and competitive...specialized consumer electronics...traditional health and fitness companies...traditional watch companies...many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies.

It's a long list of names: Garmin, Jawbone, Misfit, adidas, Under Armour, Fossil, Movado, Apple, Google, LG, Microsoft, Samsung and Xiaomi.
 
Looking at margins and returns, they aren't in the world of the software giants. So, it's not like there is fat that the competition is going after, is there?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Fitbit Inc | $2,213M | 11% | 13%
Garmin Ltd. | $2,897M | 23% | 16%
Under Armour Inc | $4,423M | 12% | 15%
adidas AG | €16,915M | 9% | 12%
Movado Group, Inc | $589M | 14% | 10%
Apple Inc. | $220,288M | 34% | 38%
Alphabet Inc | $81,761M | 33% | 15%
GoPro Inc | $1,241M | -ve | -ve
Amer Sports Oyj | €2,534M | 10% | 14%

## Cash / Debt?

Fitbit Inc has $759M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 23% of the market value of Fitbit Inc. So they've got some flexibility :)

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $21.38 for Fitbit Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 42% to their target. Which is pretty nice upside.

# Valuation

Now it's almost funny that it trades on the same PE ratio as Apple. Are they really both ex-growth? 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/fit/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

FIT | $3,341M | 13x | 20% | 0% | 4%
GRMN.O | $10,403M | 22x | 7% | 4% | 9%
UA | $16,220M | 67x | 24% | 0% | 3%
ADSGN.DE | €31,853M | 32x | 22% | 1% | 4%
MOV | $518M | 14x | N/A | 2% | 13%
AAPL.O | $581,952M | 13x | 8% | 2% | 12%
GOOGL.O | $547,473M | 24x | 18% | 0% | 4%
GPRO.O | $1,972M | -ve | -ve | 0% | -ve
AMEAS.HE | €3,004M | 20x | 15% | 2% | 8%

# Dividends

Fitbit Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And given this is really the start of the IoT / wearables market, I'm okay with that. Would like to see them investing. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 11% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. On a 6 month basis the stocks up 4% with earnings up 20% and on a 1 year basis the stock is down 66% even though the earnings are up 60%. 

So the sentiment's gone against them. Imagine, the stock's PE ratio's gone from 55x to 13x :( For me the decline in sentiment is shocking. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/fit/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. As management tell it, there are no dark clouds:

&gt; We remain optimistic for the second half of the year. As James mentioned, we expect to enter the holiday season with the most compelling lineup of new products than any previous holiday period. For Q3 we expect revenue of $490 million to $510 million, gross margins of 48% to 49%, EPS of $0.17 to $0.19

So...is this the next $GPRO? Let's look at the history there. The stock nearly hit $100 by end 2014 after it's IPO and was trading at 100x earnings. But growth hit the wall and losses soon followed. 

|$GPRO | 2017E|2016E|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Devices | N/A | N/A | 7m | 5m | 4m| 2m  | 1m|
|Revenue | $1.7bn | $1.4bn | $1.6bn | $1.4bn | $1.0bn| $0.5bn | $0.2bn|
|EPS | -$0.35 | -$1.09 | $0.25 | $0.92 | $0.47 | $0.07 | $0.24 |

So if $FIT is going to face the same wall in 4Q this year, then yes...maybe it's another $GPRO. On the other hand, maybe there's lots of growth left in this stock. 

Anyone got a view?

Hello again, 

A few days ago I submitted a half-brained post about the Ethereum blockchain that I felt did a *huge disservice* to a project that many in the tech world see similarities to that of what was happening in the days of the early 90s Internet in Silicon Valley. 

Since the inception of its whitepaper, many folks have been investing there time &amp; energy into developing potential uses case for the Ethereum network - such as decentralized cloud computing, resource sharing (Transgrid),  swarm intelligence/action/organizational networks (Backfeed, Colony), oracles (Oraclize), prediction markets (Augur, Gnosis), decentralized Reddit (Akasha), decentralized IoT, Smart city backbone, decentralized Voting systems (very timely ;), even a Supercomputer (Golem) built on the blockchain, and **so so much more**.  

Since Ethereum's blockchain coding language, Solidity, is Turing-complete, we cannot fully understand the complexity and scope of use cases that will come about from all the synergy of these decentralized applications and smart contracts.  Please take a look at some of these DEVCON2 (Annual Ethereum development conference) videos and all the development going on in this blockchain 2.0 space.  

I had posted the wrong link for Devcon2 videos in that previous post as well.  My apologies. See the link above for the corrected link.

9,2016-10-23,PuddingwithRum,8,Advice for an investment in the field of IoT,"*I obviously invested myself, which is one reason I'm sharing this with you.*

I know that people tend to stop reading if ""Bitcoin"" is mentioned, this case however is different. 

As the term ""Internet of things"" comes up more and more, the tech behind it is developing fast. 

The following post aims for investors as well as developers to become a part of an interesting project. 

-&gt; IOTA. 

IOTA is an evoluted Blockchain-technology, like Bitcoin but more sophisticated. 

Crypto-currencies differ in subject to their field of action. Some are made for security- and anonymity-reasons, some are made as data carrier. 

While Bitcoin, as the most prominent one, aims to replace currencies, IOTA is made for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).

Iota's focus lies in the interconnectedness of devices to enable micropayment in short timeframes or: “to be the backbone of the IoT”

Why the name IOTA? It refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet which is often used as “a slightest amount”. Furthermore the obvious similarity to IoT, hence the nomenclature. 

It operates on the Tangle, an evoluted Blockchain which has countless strong distinctions from a Blockchain to fit perfectly for the IoT. 

The biggest difference lies in the taxation of transactions, which is at 0.0001 BTC for Bitcoin transactions, but completely free for an IOTA- transaction. 

There are no blocks within the Tangle, and mining is not possible.

This disparity is of big importance in the world of Internet of Things as fees would handicap the transaction-environment of billions of devices. 

Further reading including a technical comparison between the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Tangle can be found here: https://medium.com/iotatangle

The scientific technical description of the Tangle can be read here:	 https://www.iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf

**To draw a conclusion:** For the first time ever, through IOTA people can transfer money without any fees. This means that even infinitesimally small nano-payments can be made through IOTA - worldwide.

IOTA is the missing puzzle piece for the Machine Economy to fully emerge and reach its desired potential. We (The devs. I'm not a dev) envision IOTA to be the public, permission-less backbone for the Internet of Things that enables true interoperability between all devices. 

A revolutionary, innovative solution for a Billion Dollar market. 

Important info for investors: IOTA is no pump&amp;dump-scheme, therefor it's right now, not possible to invest in it through exchanges, even though it's already 1 year in development. 
Exchanges will be green-lighted in a few weeks. Enough time to read about it. However, investing is possible through OTC-trading in the #trading - channel in slack. 


Feel free to ask, I'll try to answer everything.

I did some research and it seems that the growth in the VR market, IoT and machine learning seems to be driving the growth, plus the new cards released earlier this year. 
From what i've read is that AMD suffers with issues in terms of creating apps and software for machine learning, this however has changed with a company creating some software that easily converts NVIDIA machine learning software to be converted to be used on AMD machines...
