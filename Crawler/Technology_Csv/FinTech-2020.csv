Hi,

I am an Econ &amp; Finance student from the UK and my background is mostly compliance based. From my previous jobs and experience I have always wondered why the world of finance has never had more stringent compliance and AML laws considering the amount that is lost yearly through fraud and defaulting. When I have worked at FIs I have always believed that the banking &amp; finance industry needs to operate with a lot more transparency for the sake of their customers.

I was hoping to start a challenger bank where we would aim for a default risk of almost 0% mostly through asset backed loans and guarantor schemes. We would be looking to start out by repurposing existing exploitative student loans that are for students likely to pay interest of RPI +3% as they will be high earners thus targeting Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, Econ, Engineering etc. students. As well as this we would also look to offer SME and bridging loans to companies with liquid assets or coherent and viable business plans. We would also be offering these SMEs (if they are taking ecommerce payments) thorough onboarding technology so that they would be able to be fully compliant aswell as protected from fraud.

At the minute I was just looking to see if anyone has any ideas of what else they would want from an ethical banking platform. We are looking to operate in a similar way to N26, Monzo etc. by championing FinTech and the cost saving that comes with it. 

I am just writing a business plan up to present to VCs and potential investors and was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how we could ethically improve the banking and finance industry (commercial or personal).

Thanks for the help!"

I have used a couple of brokers now, including Interactive Brokers based brokers, but Interactive Brokers' software can't even display orders or account information correctly \[1\]. Additionally, their account management systems are slow (8 seconds to load a fucking page that could be cached and load in 400ms) and also full of bugs.

I have determined that Interactive Brokers is not able to write trading software and is too stupid to  continue to do business with, but then the question becomes, which broker isn't?

I would like to be able to lend shares (like Interactive Brokers offers), but otherwise I just want an order entry form that works, account information display that works, and that's it. 

I am even considering API only brokers and building my own order entry form, but AFAIK, all of those API only brokers also give you worse spreads (and I suppose a higher risk due to a worse reputation).

The last thing I want to do is talk to my broker, because they fucked up yet another time. I want a bug free trading computer to talk to.

Perhaps the whole world just consists of idiots and I already picked the best idiot in the pack, but perhaps I missed something. In summary, the world looks like ""Pay high fees(traditional banks)/pay high spreads (fintech startups)/deal with idiots (pretty much everyone depending on humans)"".

The order is for 5,000 full size electric buses, for use in various locations. The vehicles have an average cost of 800,000 Renminbi (approx. $115,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling 4Billion Renminbi, or approximately $575 Million USD.

The vehicles will be procured from a number of manufacturers within MEG's partner alliance and will be subject to a rolling delivery schedule throughout 2020 until 2022. MEG has identified commercial EV buses as a strategic segment of its business, and one in which it feels it can derive significant revenues in the next few years as EV buses deliver significant ROI for tour bus and city bus fleet operators in terms of fuel savings.

""This order is a pivotal moment for our organization, as we move to EV for our bus operations"" said Xu Yingcai, Chairman of Beijing Silk Road Rainbow. ""Our transition to clean energy is important to our organization, but also for our customers who depend on our transportation services and rely on us to make the best decisions for the environment. We are delighted to work with Mobile Energy Global and their Qingdao sales hub to fulfill this order and bring our autobus fleet to a cleaner and more energy efficient future"".

**Ideanomics Provides Updates on Subsidiary Treeletrik, plans IPO**

&amp;#x200B;

*- Ideanomics eyes Treeletrik IPO in 2020*

*- Treeletrik receives land title in port area for development into assembly facility*

*- China-based manufacturing partners to be part of land development, to include belt-and-road investment*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

NEW YORK, March 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Ideanomics, (NASDAQ: **IDEX**) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced an update on its Malaysia-based Treeletrik subsidiary.

Ideanomics acquired 51% ownership in the holding companies of Treeletrik in 2019 and the company has since begun organizing itself for growth in the ASEAN region. As part of its expansion plans, the leasehold of land graded for development has been upgraded to title holder to offer Treeletrik flexibility with the development of the 250-acre site at Gebeng Industrial Estate in Kuantan, Pahang Darul Makmur. The assessed value of the land is approximately 100 Million ringgit or $25 Million.

As part of the land development strategy, Treeletrik is planning to bring in a number of China-based manufacturing partners to help round out the EV offerings under the Treeletrik brand. Those discussions are taking place directly with Treeletrik management and augmented with discussions facilitated by Ideanomics' MEG subsidiary. MEG has been able to attract interest from China's belt-and-road development agencies for the South Asia and ASEAN regions, and anticipates that interest to develop into investment both directly and through China-based commercial EV and battery manufacturers.

Already under way with its expansion, Treeletrik has secured sizeable electric motorbike and moped orders through distributors in Indonesia, and talks are ongoing with other countries expressing an interest across their vehicle range. Indonesia's population, like many other countries in the ASEAN region, relies heavily on motorbikes for transportation based on two important factors of cost and traffic congestion. To compliment the bike sales opportunities, Ideanomics is assisting Treeletrik with developing a focus on commercial EV activities.

Additionally, as the land development, manufacturing partnerships, belt-and-road investment, and large-scale orders will all result in significant expansion in both Malaysia and International operations of Treeletrik, the company will look to go public in either Singapore or Hong Kong, with the possibility to do so later in 2020. The IPO will provide Treeletrik will additional capital to fuel its growth plans, and in turn unlock value for the broader investor market.

NEW YORK, March 10, 2020 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- [Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2745651-1&amp;h=202550487&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics), (NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced a detailed update to its Mobile Energy Global (""MEG"") activities, including the impact of the Coronavirus on its Q1 activities.

In general, Chinese companies returned to work at the start of March with most major commercial activities slowly getting back to normal. MEG's partners have been impacted to varying degrees and recent conversations have shown there is a resolute effort being made to recover quickly from the effects of the outbreak. Currently, there are no details available for any government stimulus programs to help the Chinese economy recover from the shutdown, so we are unable to determine what participation opportunities, if any, may be available to Ideanomics and MEG.

**A: Financing / Funding for Fleet Purchasing**

In September 2018, Ideanomics announced its agreement with First Auto Loan, regarding lease financing and ABS products with a target of raising $6 Billion to fund the lease financing of ride-share vehicles and other types of app-requested taxis. This agreement is currently in progress and will benefit from the capital sourcing referenced below.

In November and December of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced the creation of multiple funds in association with Dasheng Licheng Lease Financing, with Ideanomics bringing in several high-profile insurance companies to provide large-scale funds to support EV lease financing programs. The final province-level registrations were underway when the outbreak occurred and are now back underway. The impact on bringing these funds to market will now extend into Q2 but should otherwise remain unaffected.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an agreement with China's Yunnan province which included lease financing for the heavy truck segment, with backing by AAA-rated province-specific entities in conjunction with MEG's lease financing programs. The deal also provided for investment into charging station infrastructure, as well as investment into Treeletrik via Yunnan's role as the ASEAN region's belt and road sponsor. The shutdown impacted the timing on this, particularly as it pertained to final registration and approvals at local government, but is expected to be reinstated in the near term.

**B: EV and EV Battery Manufacturing Alliance**

Over the course of the past 18 months or so, Ideanomics, and subsequently MEG, has partnered with leading EV and EV Battery manufacturers, including JAC, Geely, Beijing Foton, CATL, and Yinlong, among others. These partnerships are an important part of the overall offering and assist MEG in offering competitive procurement and order fulfillment. Having best-in-class partners ensures we can meet the needs of fleet operators in terms of vehicle specifications, quality, reliability, and cost and continue to attract large-scale order interest.

As part of the commencement of activities in Qingdao, we will be showcasing many of these partners at our EV sales hub and anticipate additional manufacturing partners participating based on their value to the overall offering.

We had begun to implement a joint marketing strategy with select partners, including our participation with CATL in the now postponed EV Mining event in Stockholm, Sweden on March 18-20. It has been tentatively rescheduled until November of this year, due to Coronavirus concerns.

**C. Joint Ventures and Other Strategic and Umbrella Agreements**

Ideanomics and MEG has announced several agreements as either joint ventures, strategic partnerships, or umbrella agreements, which form part of MEG's business development and revenue pipeline development activities. These include deals with the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for MEG involvement in supporting the transition to EV mining, which we anticipate will be a significant revenue division for our organization; Zhitong 3000, where we intend to offer their fleet customers' MEG services; activities securing relationships with tourism associations to develop EV tour bus revenues; and more. Each of these is progressing in the normal course of business in the context of earlier sections of this update and, in particular, section A as it pertains to lease financing services.

**D: Sales Agreements for Execution**

In August of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with iUnicorn, to procure and finance 90,000 taxis for the city of Chengdu, in addition to other cities. In September of 2019, MEG announced the delivery of an additional 4,127 taxis, with confirmation of a further 11,000 to be delivered by the end of 2019. These are subject to the return of local government, to process the final rebate and registration approvals. We anticipate this occurring when the spring temperatures reduce the impact of the outbreak and cities return to normal levels of commerce and the resulting demand for public transportation is restored to pre-outbreak levels.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an order from Yunnan province for 35,000 taxis, and an additional order for 2,300 taxis from the city of Guillin, in Guanxi province. Both of these orders are delayed due to the closure of non-essential local government services, which we anticipate returning to normal in a similar manner to the iUnicorn JV.

In addition to the sales agreements mentioned above, the MEG team has developed a diverse pipeline of sales orders, with interest and activities in all four of its EV revenue divisions of Heavy Trucks, Buses and Coaches, Logistical Vehicles, and Taxis. In lieu of the lease financing funds availability, MEG has been pursuing bespoke financing for each order, respectively. Furthermore, the recently announced Qingdao sales center activities will help further augment sales going forward.

**E. Global EV Sales Expansion**

In March of 2019, Ideanomics announced the acquisition of 51% of Malaysia-based EV manufacturer and distributor, Treeletrik. Since the acquisition, Treeletrik has hired an experienced CEO from the automotive industry, increased its sales and after sales operations, upgraded the land secured under the acquisition from leasehold to title holder, secured orders elsewhere in the ASEAN region, and is in negotiations to bring in a number of Chinese EV manufacturing and EV battery partners to help round out its KD and assembly activities such that it can scale its supply operations to ensure order fulfilment.

Outside of Asia, MEG has received some preliminary order inquiries in the Middle East and plans to broadly expand its global footprint once all of its China-based activities are under way.

**F: Energy Sales**

MEG's core strategy is to acquire fleet customers, through offering innovative and cost-efficient transition to EV, such that we transition the consumption of energy from Gasoline and Diesel onto cleaner Electricity. MEG has signed numerous joint venture and strategic partnership agreements to help develop its relationships in this regard and plans to sell both pre-paid electricity at a discount to fleet operators, as well as participate in the lucrative EV charging market. Each of these is valid and in process for normal course of business, with the major highlights detailed below.

In July of 2019, Ideanomics announced agreements with Three Gorges, to include Tianda Energy and Ding Fang, and Palcan Energy to finance and develop EV fast charging networks. MEG has continued to explore these and other EV fast charging technologies, including those from our EV battery partners, as detailed in the PetroChina update below.

In September 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with PetroChina, to begin a project to repurpose gas stations to EV fast charging stations, starting with the city of Nanjing. To date, as there is rapidly-evolving technology development in the areas of EV charging and energy management and storage solutions, we are dependent on the certification of new technologies and apparatus for commercial use such that we ensure the most up to date technologies and charging experience are deployed.

**G: Other Financial Services / ABS**

In August of 2018, Ideanomics announced an agreement with NTC to provide ABS refinancing for buses in several China cities, including Tianjin. Subsequently, Ideanomics announced agreements in January of 2019 with financial institutions to provide financing and other services to support the ABS under the NTC agreement.

The debt rating of Tianjin at municipal level, along with delayed deliveries from manufacturers, has proved challenging for underwriting and issuance of ABS. In June of 2019, Ideanomics signed an agreement with EV bus and battery manufacturer Yinlong covering both China and Ex-China activities. As Yinlong had already delivered 5.1Billion RMB of manufacturer financed EV buses in Tianjin, outside of the Ideanomics agreement, we began discussions in late Q3 / early Q4 with Yinlong to reorganize the registration and recording of those delivered assets such that they can be compliant with ABS requirements. That activity is underway, albeit it was disrupted and delayed by the Coronavirus activities in the region. Additionally, MEG plans to work closely with Yinlong in 2020 to help support the delivery of additional city bus orders in order to facilitate the ABS refinancing accordingly.

In June of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with GCL, to include GCL contributing guaranteed sales orders of 500,000 logistical vehicle orders over the next three years. These orders will require financing under the lease financing activities covered in section A, as the original barter-plus-subsidy deal put in place is not being accepted by manufacturers. Several of the small to mid-size orders from the GCL order flow are currently in the pipeline to help develop and streamline the deal expediting process of our lease financing activities.

It's been down since yesterday and I still can't access my account. Pretty bad considering there was a massive selloff in the BTC markets yesterday.  


They aren't answering any support emails either. Any suggestions?"
10,2020-03-08,Reggy187,1,Permabulls meet the cliff,"This isn't meant to be controversial, but even R/wallstreetbets isn't as dogmatic as this reddit can be. If you find yourself quoting some old wallstreet slang or some old investor. Just don't. None of them have traded through a market with this much leverage, at the end of a business cycle, and a pandemic all at the same time. Many some, but never all three.

With that, we are about to enter the mother of all bear markets, all of the major economies are about to enter a huge recession coupled with possible quarantines. We will see deflation globally and inflation on consumer products domestically. 

So what is the trade now? What are the risks? and who do we do? Honestly wish I had a crystal ball, but this is what I see.

TRADE Now:
Short/buy puts
1. Anything related to travel, hotels, automotive, farm equipment, oil, large industrial ex utilities. (No one is going to be buying any of this) Some of the large industrial and airlines will get bailed out as ""strategic."" The rest won't. 
2. Banks, fin tech, insurance, and retail. These will be hurting, fintech and retail will see the most carnage as they won't be bailed out. Big banks and insurance will get bailed out, and most likely have a ban on shorting them soon.
3. Foreign currency. (USD will be king here on out The only thing that may outperform is swiss francs, but it a much smaller market) (Gold will be attacked from every side as people try and stop it, gold will catch a bid later and will see a huge bull run, but no need to start early.)
4. EMs are doomed, they will be short USD for trade and no tourism. They may catch the first bid on the other side of this recession, but they will see lots of red first.

THE RISK
Bailouts, central banks will bail out all of the usual suspects. This will make them zombies for a while. They will also buy up indexes like the DOW 30, S&amp;P500, Russel 2000. (So careful after they go full blown 30%+ in the red, start to cover and shrink your option positions)
Sovereign debt crisis, after bailing out everything, a lot of M1 money will be created, this will create issues for USD strength later. Duration Tbills will get butchered later. TIPS will be the safer haven, but I doubt they will keep up.

THE PLAY
1. The game is during illiquid period. Go after hotels, cruises, canadian oil, US oil, fintech, EMs, industrials, insurance, and banks. (Many will go insolvent) 
2. when illiquidity ends. Insolvency starts, this is when you get away from the USD. Go long gold, EMs, commodities, foreign currencies and short duration US bonds. 
3. Last, when the US jobs start to recover pile back in on all of the usual suspects: FAANGs, semis, tech everything, banks (maybe)"

The order is for a total of 1,200 logistical vehicles and fulfilled by China-based EV manufacturer [Jiangsu AOXIN New Energy Automobile](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2680758-1&amp;h=12719485&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aoxinauto.com%2Feng%2Fabout1.asp%3Fid%3D1&amp;a=Jiangsu+AOXIN%C2%A0New+Energy+Automobile) Co., Ltd. through their X30L model, with the first 500 ordered in Q4, and the remaining 700 being ordered for Q1, 2020, for a total possible order value of 167 Million RMB, or approximately $24 Million.

The initial order signed during Q4 is for 500 vehicles, with the remaining order for 700 vehicles in Q1 2020. The vehicles are city/urban delivery cargo vans intended to facilitate last-mile deliveries. MEG will derive fees from this transaction through arranging the procurement and financing, although the company has not yet completed the accounting analysis to determine whether this revenue should be recorded on a Gross or Net basis under US GAAP – meaning the revenues may reflect net fees earned and not the $24MM order value.

""We are thrilled to get our first EV logistical vehicle orders underway, as this represents our largest potential segment of MEG in terms of vehicle order numbers and is the second of our four operating segments to successfully source large-scale EV vehicle orders,"" said Alf Poor, CEO of Ideanomics. ""This helps us confidently plan for 2020, knowing that each of our four segments is going to be active and, along with our bus and heavy truck segments, are already sourcing deal flow. With our taxi activities in Chengdu and Guilin held over until Q1, due to municipal subsidies and new taxi license policies being put in place for 2020, we were able to bring this deal together quickly and efficiently, prior to our lease financing funding channels coming online. This, together with our Taxi activities in Chengdu, Guilin, and Yunnan province in Q1, will provide us with a platform that will ramp up in Q2 and beyond as our business begins to hit its stride.""

The logistical vehicle market in China is estimated at 14 million vehicles, making it a considerable growth market for the EV industry.

It’s offering them three months of service.

&gt;A month of Robinhood Gold costs $5 plus 5% yearly interest on borrowing above $1,000, charged daily. Before a pricing change, the flat fee per month could range as high as $200. However, compensated users will only get the $5 off per month, for a total of $15. That could seem woefully insufficient if Robinhood users missed out on buying back into stocks like Apple that went up over 9% on Monday. Robinhood is calling it a “first step”.

13,2020-03-03,TheLordAsriel,1,Levy an indemnity on China,"When World War I ended a hefty war indemnity was levied on Germany.

What is happening in the world today is not as worse in terms of human toll but a different kind of toll on humans, many economies, businesses and so on

Stock and bond markets are getting hammered without any end in sight and I think an indemnity of sort must be exacted on China for letting their bio-weapon loose on the world population. 

All of this is unnecessary shit - like kids in schools being affected by a lockdown and folks in hazmat suits cleaning up like Chernobyl. Personally I have lost a ton of money in my long positions. I had to enter some uneasy short positions and thankfully my Robinhood account is only a tester account with 300 bucks because I never trusted those fucxkers and I knew this would happen.

Silicon Valley techies DO NOT understand Finance or the seriousness of ongoing contracts between counterparties. At least the silver lining here is that these fintech rats will cease to exist and some form of happy medium comes through."

We are currently putting the feelers out for any additional investor interest so please do read in if you are bored or hopefully interested! Apologies in advance if anyone considers this as spam, that is not my intention.","I’m the founder and CEO of UK based startup Deposited. 

We provide a financed alternative to rental security deposits in the UK. We are currently in extensive talks with a major bank in the UK and have developed a bespoke insurance product that guarantees Deposited reclaim any missed payments from our customers. We are currently the only business worldwide to have this due to our extensive insurance and finance network.

We won ourselves a spot on the number one business accelerator in the world funded by the EU - setsquared due to winning a large scaled pitching competition in 2019.

The idea is very much past concept stage and we have the blueprints, financials, deck all ready to go. We have had signed past investment deals with overseas investors however for one reason and another these have not materialised.

If this is something you might be interested in we are looking for a total of £100k in return for 20% equity either as a lone investor syndicated. I’m available for a Skype or zoom call should you so wish.

17,2020-04-11,Neverknowthefeel,0,Not sure if this is the righ subreddit but need advice on whether this constitutes as insider trading,"Long story short. 

Worked at a fintech company where you have to disclose any  brokerage accounts. When I started working at the company I disclosed I used robinhood. The compliance officer said they dont support that brokerage account and I should stop using it.  

However, according to a few other employees they said they all use it even though it is not supported.  I'm not sure how they are disclosing trades since they cannot use  that account. So I'm assuming they are not, or they wanted me to use the app and get in trouble. 

Should this be reported? I may not have enough information, so I guess I cant."
18,2020-04-09,HowardRand,2,Report from the ground. Please contribute.,"I wanted to share what I am seeing from the ground level to accompany all the macro numbers we are seeing. It would be great if some of you could share what you are seeing from your perspectives as well.

I work for a small (25 employees) fintech/healthcare company and have had numerous conversation with both community banks and healthcare organizations.

**Healthcare.** Not surprisingly the sector is hurting across the board. Organizations fall into two main categories: hospitals and health systems overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients and independent physician practices, surgery centers, dental clinics etc. that have closed their doors temporarily. Obviously non-essential practices that are temporarily closed are hurting due to lack of revenue and most have laid off the majority of their staff. Hospitals are hurting both due to a sharp increase in costs (purchasing supplies, adding capacity, paying overtime, etc.) and the loss of elective procedures which are by far their most profitable services. [A large system, Quorum Health, is filing for bankruptcy](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/quorum-health-faces-bankruptcy-as-covid-19-bears-down.html) and their are rumblings that more will follow. All healthcare organizations are in survival mode and are cutting costs wherever they can, mostly by laying people off.

**Banks.** My company works with community banks and credit unions, not the big guys. Our banks are completely overwhelmed with trying to deal with [SBA PPP](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/coronavirus-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program-ppp) applications. It's pretty much the only thing banks are doing right now and they are trying to do it remotely which many are not set up to do.

**My company.** We have not laid anybody off yet but I think it is likely in the future for some on our healthcare facing product. Healthcare organizations are just not in a position to be shopping for new products, implementing new tools, or kicking off new projects. We work with a small marketing firm and a small sales consulting firm. The marketing firm laid off an AE they hired just a few months ago as their clients are all dialing back their work. The sales consulting firm laid off the SVP we were working with when our contract with them ended at the end of March (this was an experienced, qualified, and knowledgeable guy).

**Other relationships.** My SO's company, a small (75ish employees) energy efficiency consulting firm, laid off 40% of their workforce today due to many clients dialing back work and their investors trying to sort out their positions. My friend is a counselor who was laid off immediately when schools closed for the remainder of the year. 

**Conclusion.** I have the impression (I could be wrong) that many think the unemployment numbers are mostly service sector employees who are all going to go back to work in a month or two when restaurants re-open, entertainment returns, and non-essential retail reopens. I am seeing something very different. I am seeing businesses retracting all around me, laying off quality employees, putting new projects on hold, delaying signing contracts, etc. From my small world this does not appear to be a blip that we will pop out of in a few months if/when some sense of normalcy returns. It appears to be an environment of cost cutting and hunkering down for the foreseeable future.

I would love to hear your perspective from your industry."

20,2020-05-07,Catalin888,1,Any Fintech companies publicly treaded ?,[removed]
21,2020-05-04,codingprofessor,1,My stock study watchlist. would appreciate criticisms or red flags,"**Core**

\- FB ecosystem

This is the stock that i believe is invested in the right places and has a path forward in the global market. I work as a React developer in fintech and I greatly enjoy their technology. The reason I stopped using snapchat was because I couldn't use it on low connection in Mexico, but Instagram worked marvelously. I use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my family in mexico and Facebook to stay in touch with my mom. There's something extremely powerful about that in my opinion. 

They're conservative with their push and development of camera  and VR technology which is wise in my opinion give the many opportunities that exist in that space. They're pushing along with fintech in India, again with small business through Whatsapp. And they provide a suite of customer services for small business and entrepeneurs.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Microsoft

I think they will have a great run during the cloud era of software development. Their acquiring of Github AND NPM goes to show how in touch they are with developer servicing.

\- Cisco

Same as Microsoft but for IT.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Paypal

Paypal has a marvelous history and is a battle tested pioneer in the fintech space. I see them repeating their previous successes by acquiring Honey. I work with Honey in the fintech space and now I'm understanding that Paypal has an auto coupon scraper on my Amazon purchases while my Visa ones don't. This is the forward thinking I love from Paypal despite not being as flashy as Square.

\- Visa

They make a FUCKTON of money on transactions. Jesus christ.

\- Disney

Disney is quintessential american entertainment. I believe their deep roots in American culture and the entertainment industry will provide a solid bedrock for them for the generations to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Waste Management

Sanitation and environmental, like internet connection technology, are about the same when it comes to market penetration. It is a scarcity. Sanitation is a critical part of any society's development and wellbeing. I think WM will be there to benefit from increased urbanization and industriousness from technology and wealth growth.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kansas City Southern

I'm Mexican and my family are avocado farmers. I believe in the future prospects of Mexico and its relationship with its neighbors. Mexico is a bustling nation and many youth are international students that carry degrees. This is a far cry from having military policing streets in rural neighborhoods decades ago. Kansas city southern is part of the supply chain that connects Mexico to main industrious Mexican states like Monterrey, Jalisco, and Michaocan. I like rail in this regard because it's a lot of weight in one operation of heavy materials. So Canadians that use Mexican mining will also benefit from this railroad.

\- Nintendo

I believe in the future of gaming as a market and if I were to take a shot at who would be the most stable, I would vote for Nintendo. Like Facebook, they approach the family unit and grow generationally. I love their curveball approach to gaming and I think that creativity, along with it's customers trust, will be something I can hold onto for a long time versus companies that have a history of developing games like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Nintendo can take different forms: in the living room, at sweaty tournaments, online, mobile, on your phone, on a TV, in the movies, etc.

\- Impossible Foods IPO

I've been vegetarian for 10 years and Impossible Burgers has been one of the most mindblowing experiences of my life. The product is phenomenal and on a league of its owned compared to Beyond Meat. IMHO Beyond taste like cheap school lunchroom burgers and Impossible tastes like something I would be excited to feed my family. If their pork products are great then I am ALL in because Chicken products are by far the easiest thing to replicate. I'm extremely excited about this product

\- United Health or Cigna

This is only going to grow and wont change due to American politics for 8 years at a minimum.

**Closely watching**

\- Square

I work in the fintech space and I like their modest approach to financial services. Their acquiring of a bank charter is actually incredibly important due to all the procurement and legal processes that go behind being a fintech company (abiding by federal security laws, etc). The one reason I like Chase banking is because I enjoy their app. I see Square as a competitor to Chase, surprisingly.

\- Apple

Apple designs its products with customer service in mind. I think the future of education technology will likely go to Apple because of this. Their screens and cameras are wonderful and I can see them pioneering computer vision products because of this. They are THE American Tech company.

\- TMobile

Aggressive as hell and grew to be a large player through savvy moves across time. Their customer service is a highlight for me.

\- JPM

Customer service for banking is unmatched IMO. If any legacy banker will make it across changes, I believe Chase is doing what it takes to adapt and think forward.

\- Planet Fitness

$10 gyms, clean, and casual enough for the general population. You can't beat $10 gym membership when you're broke as fuck. I've been a heavy lifter before and still used Planet fitness in my transitions across states and whatnot. I need to look at their numbers more closely.

\- Volkwagen

I trust Europe and Japan to take EVs more seriously. I don't know who will seriously come close to competing with Tesla in the long run but they'll have to.

\- Panasonic

Panasonic, much like AMD, did not immediately reflect the value of what they have produced. AMD did not explode inline with bitcoin or cheaper GPU consumption, in the same way Panasonic did not reflect a massive spike in price after speculation in Tesla grew. They're an important arm to the EV market that spreads across many players ranging from Tesla to Toyota to big tech.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think Lyft's focus on customer service and regional clientele will pay off against Uber, who is growing too quickly and spreading thin. Lyft will benefit from the development of computer vision and Big tech's interest in automanufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crypto (Bitcoin or XRP)

I like crypto as a technology as a software engineer. I see the value in a faster process for procuring and exchanging legal tender that does not have to go through the bottleneck of the ACH process or through legal issues like the PATRIOT ACT or the Bank Secrecy Act. It still fundamentally respects those laws without the frustrations of banking service bottlenecks.  I think the halvening protocol has an interesting affect on Bitcoin and supply and the market that it's trying to generate.

&amp;#x200B;
