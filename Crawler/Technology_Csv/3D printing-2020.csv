hmmm...
Any good 3d Printing buys out there?"
1,2020-04-29,BehindTheRedCurtain,1,Investing in Industrial 3D Printing,"As the market for 3D printing was expected to boom in the mid 2010's on the possibility of home-based 3D printers, we saw it fall as that application never took form. Now were seeing the use shift to industrial 3D printing. Is anything currently invested in Industrial 3D printing? If so, what companies do you like, and why?"
2,2020-04-26,totally-not-a-trader,1,Why SHOULDN'T large scale 3D printing be the future?,"The implications for large scale and rapid product development for literally everything under the sun can be done by 3D printers.

Want a house? Boom
Want a fucking gun? Boom
Want to literally make artificial organs in 0G? Boom

Please, if you're an expert on 3D printing I need you to provide me every supporting detail as to why the 3D printing industry is going to underperform."
3,2020-04-23,proprietism,1,Highest growth sectors to invest in for the next 10 years?,"I want to build a semi-diversified portfolio with the major players in Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, maybe Facebook plus picking one more great company from each of the following sectors which I think will be major growth sectors over the next ten years:

Online retail

Cloud technology

AI

Anti-Aging

Nanotechnology

Finance

Self-Driving Cars

3D Printing

Automation

Robotics

Healthcare/Pharma

Semiconductors

Next Gen Energy

Aerospace/Defense

There's obviously some overlap here, but what other sectors did I miss that will be likely potential major global growth industries over the next 10 years? ex. Artificial meat? Marijuana? 

Are any of these sectors already way too overbought or overrated?"

I boil them down into easily digestible blurbs, summarized below. I plan to do this as a weekly or bi-weekly series. Unfortunately automod is quite strict about external links, so I don’t link directly to the original report, but a quick Google search should turn these up.*

**Company:** Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN)

**Short call by:** Spruce Point on 4/9/2020

**Thesis:** Align is a medical device company, well known for their Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanners. Spruce Point believes that several looming factors could cause a mass exodus by orthodontists from Align, who already has a terrible reputation in the space. Advancements in 3D printing have allowed competitors to potentially produce the same devices at discounts of 50% or more. Several former executives have left Align to start their own competing firm, and at least one major client of Align is looking to source alternative providers.

&amp;#x200B;

**Company:** iQIYI, Inc. (IQ)

**Short call by:** Wolfpack Research on 4/7/2020

**Thesis:** iQIYI is a Chinese technology company, dubbed the “Netflix of China”. Wolfpack alleges that iQIYI has been inflating its revenue numbers by 27-44% (RMB 8-13B). The evidence comes from surveying over 1500 Chinese users, of which approximately 30% are not direct subscribers, but obtain a free membership through partners such as JD.com or Xiaomi TV. Despite not being direct subscribers, iQIYI still records them as part of revenue as if they were. Even with the revenue inflation, iQIYI has recorded 10 straight years of losses, with the losses accelerating in recent years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Company:** WD-40 Company (WDFC)

**Short call by:** Spruce Point on 4/2/2020

**Thesis:** WD-40 Company develops and sells chemically based maintenance, homecare and cleaning products worldwide. Spruce Point believes the company is under major financial strain, having recently drawn down 100% of its available credit facility. During the 2008 recession, WD-40 suffered considerably, missing sales and EPS estimates by 13% and almost 10% in 2009. The company could suffer a similar fate in the current recessionary climate, especially with mounting FDA regulations against its chemical products.

&amp;#x200B;

**Company:** Athersys, Inc. (ATHX)

**Short call by:** Alpha Exposure on 4/2/2020

**Thesis:** Arthersys is a biotech company who has been in the news recently for its MultiStem treatment, which has been touted as having promising results in treating COVID-19. Alpha Exposure predicts that in fact Arthersys failed its phase 2 trial. The root of the thesis hinges on the theory that Arthersys did not publish results on the two primary endpoints of the study, nor provide p-values indicating the treatment’s efficacy. Furthermore, the author believes that ARDS data is more than a year away, and there are other more promising treatments which will reach market faster.

&amp;#x200B;

**Company:** HF Foods Group (HFFG)

**Short call by:** Hindenburg Research on 3/23/2020

**Thesis:** HF Foods distributes food products targeted towards Asian restaurants in certain regions of the United States. Hindenburg alleges “outrageous” fraudulent behavior all around. “HF has transacted with at least 43 separate related-party entities in 2019 alone. Several are based out of the company’s own headquarters and appear to have no operations. We visited others across the country and found red flags suggesting that these related parties are being used by insiders to extract cash from the business.” Other red flags include directing over $2M to purchase exotic cars for the chairman’s son, and the firm’s auditors being under scrutiny from the SEC."
6,2020-05-05,codingprofessor,1,Some small-med cap stocks (~10B and under) that I'm studying during lockdown,"\- Cloudflare

Cloudflare has been around for a long time in many notable pockets of the internet. I think the need and importance of content-delivery  is only to increase with the development of cloud networking. Many that argue that ""Google and Amazon could just replace them"" aren't seeing how important it is to just be dedicated as as security company.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Dennys  
They have a bunch of real-estate and are a pretty important part of American logistics.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Draft Kings

Company that's been around for a long time that's starting to play ball in the legal app world. They're also well connected after many years of word-of-mouth building.

\- Groupon

A tech dinosaur. I'm examining this stock after the recent acquisition of Honey (amazon coupon scraper) from Paypal for 4 billon dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Planet Fitness

I think they've executed pretty well over the years. It's pretty hard to beat a servicable $10 gym that focuses on cleanliness and casual exercising. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Nissan

They have a pretty messy history and I'm taking a look at their attempts to turn it around.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think theyre the more focused version of Uber that focuses more on customer satisfaction  and acquisition over innovation and spread.
