2,2016-02-14,Surfaccountant,0,Eleven major banks testing blockchain technology. Checkout Ethereum!,"Article: http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-banking-trading-blockchain-idUKKCN0UY28W. 
I've learned alot about ethereum and its potential to disinter mediate the financial industry. Recommend you do some of your own research. And come to your own conclusions on the potential opportunities. You may thank me one day. (Hint. POS)"
3,2016-02-11,americanpegasus,0,"With the IMF urging a move to all digital money (so they can impose negative interest rates) and a current flight into gold, now is the time to get interested and involved in cryptocurrency (more than ever).","JPM just said that something must be very wrong for people to be fleeing back into gold, and it most certainly is.  (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-11/jpm-ficc-head-people-have-more-confidence-gold-bank-deposits-or-paper-money)  
  
The world is waking up to the realization that nothing is sacred and all money is a set of convenient rules we have agreed on to transact with each other.  You could call it 'imaginary' but that wouldn't be totally accurate: it is the group belief in an asset that gives it power and authority.  
  
Until now we have relied on megabanks to set monetary policy for the world but there are signs that a titanic meltdown may be happening within that furnace.  Signs if this are everywhere, including conspiring to force the world to move to an all-digital financial ecosystem so dramatic negative rates can be imposed: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-02-10/something-very-disturbing-spotted-morgan-stanley-presentation-slide.  I won't engage in any 'told you so' here; I simply want to urge you to get involved in cryptocurrency, even as a mental excursion.  
  
The IMF certainly is, and it is very likely that by the 2020s global finance will run on top of a combination of these new fangled 'blockchains'.  
  
You have many reputable projects to choose from, and a few other fringe ones if you want to get your feet wet with experimental cryptography.  
  
**Bitcoin**: the original implementation of decentralized digital money.  It is the largest and most well known Blockchain in the world.  It's use of a public ledger and necessary transition to a deflationary and fee-based economy has caused criticism, but there is likely a bright future ahead of it (cue the trolls badgering me about sidechains).  
  
**Ethereum**: a Blockchain purporting to use its tokens as programmable nodes in a cloud computer.  It's value has been on a tear lately, and despite having initially sold as an IPO (something many in the community find distasteful) it has been publicly supported by both Nick Szabo and Microsoft.  
  
**Monero**: The largest current Cryptonote implementation, it was the first major Blockchain to add privacy and anonymity into a decentralized and digital Blockchain.  It is tiny at the moment but arguably has the most advanced financial technology in the entire world.  
  
**[Tangle-based Ideas]**:  there are some new currencies that are aiming to work via a new method that doesn't use a Blockchain at all, but I have not fully reviewed them and they are very new concepts.  
  
**[Zerocash]**: the strongest form of cryptocurrency that we have ever invented is actually a little too strong as currency destroying bugs might be undetectable, a non-zero number of trusted parties is required at Genesis, and it is untested cryptography.  Nevertheless research into this continues.  
  
**[R3]**:  Blythe Masters, JP Morgan, and everyone else involved in this are attempting to take Bitcoin and turn it into a 'shared spreadsheet' which is a catastrophic waste of time and money.  A reversible Blockchain that uses trust is the same thing we have now, and defeats the entire point.  They are basically marveling at the Internet, and have decided to reinvent cable television based off of it.

4,2016-02-09,americanpegasus,0,"I called the recent market top and predicted the end of this tech bubble - after giving some of the best performing stocks of the preceding bull run. Now find out what's next, from the master himself.","Everyone knows I am one of the greatest oracles of the modern day.  How I have not been scooped up by some forward-thinking banking think-tank is a cosmic mystery.  
  
Consider I have given /r/investing such stocks as Netflix, Michael Kors, and 3D Systems before any of their monster runs back in 2012.  
  
Then, since early last year I've been warning that we have reached peak market conditions:  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2onv3v/and_then_the_tech_bubble_20_crashed/?  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34axx6/today_a_coworker_struck_up_a_conversation_about/  
  
This subreddit scoffed and continues to scoff at my legendary prowess, but I don't mind.  In fact, last May I told you all that Bitcoin's return over the next 12 months would more than *double* the best performing Vanguard index fund, and **it certainly has**, soaring from $230 to $370.  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/34hxdn/the_pegasus_vanguard_vs_bitcoin_challenge_put/?  
  
If that's not enough, I also warned you about the continuing spread of negative interest rates, which are still getting worse by the day:  
  
https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3o3dun/three_month_treasury_yields_are_at_zero_percent/?  
  
-------  
  
So, many of you (including top investment professionals at major firms) are probably wondering: ""Pegasus, *wow*!  What's next?""  
  
Well, I'll tell you again, like I always do.  2016 is going to be a crazy year folks; you better buckle up.  
  
**This market isn't going back up until it goes down a lot more!**  
  
I'm calling for a major crash to really punctuate this recent spiral, and I mean something nasty.  I'm expecting a spring time frame, probably in March (yes, as in next month!)  
  
Oil isn't going anywhere.  Expect capitulation to occur as we finally hit $17 a barrel, and possibly lower.  Only then will we go back up, and even then it will take a while to recover.  Bottom line: people trying to catch the falling knife in oil are gonna get burned.  
  
I expect talk of QE4 to begin after the crash though, and it won't be able to come soon enough!  Without QE4 we may see a bottom of 1100 in the S&amp;P by this time next year.  With Q&amp;E?  Well I can't foresee how much magical pretend money the government will print into the stock market, but the reckoning we will face will be the same.     
   
It's simple math: hard assets are going to be precious luxuries soon.  The paper gold market is in for an upheaval as we collectively discover that paper gold is currently a major sham, but the world isn't going back to precious metals... No, the way forward isn't shiny rocks but decentralized digital networks.  
  
This R3 thing the banks are working on?  Because they have so fundamentally misunderstood what a decentralized blockchain is, it will falter and fail.  The banks will use it, of course, in order to try to justify the millions they will spend making it.  But they will eventually abandon it in favor of a true decentralized alternative.  
  
Speaking of which, for a year now I've been intrigued and 'infiltrating' the world of new *private* digital financial networks.  These use protocol level cryptography for financial privacy.  Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero and Aeon are likely to become very big deals in coming years (but I am invested in them, and represent them, so don't take my word for it - check out the cutting edge Cryptonote protocol they are based off of).   
  
The stock market isn't going to implode forever, and I expect a new mega bull run to kick off before 2020, but it's not going to start without some pain first.   
  
Money itself is going to experience it's 'uber moment' and we may even begin to see regulated crypto-securities.  If R3 ever finds a real world niche, it could potentially be here, but I still wouldn't bet on it.  
  
Anyhow, I wouldn't be fucking with anyone at the moment, especially not the 50 - 200 P/E companies that boast 'lots of users'.  You thought LinkedIn's mega crash was news?  More are coming.  
  
You'll know when this tech 2.0 bubble has fully crashed back to Earth because we will be considering the long term viability of even juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon.  And here's where you buy back in.  
  
It's easier said than done now, because when the time comes to buy back in we may truly be in the throes of a major economic crisis.  People will scoff at owning Facebook, Google, or Apple stock but that is where you must go.  
  
The big winners in the next bull run?  The sci-fi tech of tomorrow: virtual reality, self-driving cars, digital money, 3D printing, and AI.  
  
Anyway, I've said enough.  I'm happy to see this crash finally get underway because I know that on the other side of every crash lies opportunity - I just would caution against trying to catch this one on the way down.  You may say to ""buy fear"" but I would argue we haven't even seen fear yet - we're just getting started here.  
  
As always, note that this is all my own opinion and I am not an investment professional.  I am not licensed to give financial advice to anyone, and have no current market positions, long or short.  I only own 100% cryptocurrency at the moment, which I plan to hold for the foreseeable future, and partially diversify from once this market is much lower.  
  
Feel free to disagree with me and be on the wrong side of history yet again.  
  
"
5,2016-04-22,americanpegasus,0,More and more people will begin trading on crypto exchanges. It is a superior experience to other markets.,"I hear you fuming already: Mt. Gox!  Beanie Babies!  Pyramids!   
  
Fact is, crypto is here to stay.  And even though the underlying assets are not as prestigious as blue chip stocks like IBM and Disney (*yet*), trading on a decent crypto exchange is **undoubtedly** better than trading on almost any online brokerage in the world.  
  
Let's take my own favorite exchange Poloniex (but there are other good ones too like Bittrex, lest I be accused of shilling):  Trades are nearly free, costing just cents per trade.  Trades settle instantly with actual money, which you can withdraw as fast as that asset's blockchain allows.  Also, once you have crypto assets, money can flow easily into and out of the exchange for a fee of pennies.  
  
I can have bitcoins, move them to Poloniex, be trading in other blockchains within minutes, execute 100 trades that day, then withdraw either bitcoins or another asset that same day... All painlessly with no PDT regulations to worry about or any settlement periods.   
  
The only problem is the lack of worthwhile crypto assets to speculate/trade in!  This will improve in coming years, but for the moment there are still a few and already in 2016 people have made good money on crypto exchanges (and lost money too - nothing can be done without risk).  
  
It's not the Nasdaq yet, but crypto exchanges offer a superior experience to the OTCBB already... And it will only get better with time."
6,2016-04-08,Reggie-Middleton,0,"So Called ""Trusted Parties"", Bank Collapse, the ECB and Blockchains: Watch as I Call the Next Bear Stearns, Again!","The vendors and proprietors of blockchain solutions have almost all traveled the private blockchain route. We, at Veritaseum, have decided to go in the opposite direction. Call it a yearning for our macro and fundamental analysis roots, but the risk of trusting untrustworthy parties is just too great. The only way to eliminate the need for trust is to open the network to many parties. Think the power of the Internet vs the utility of an intranet.

What are your thoughts on the rising interests from banks in blockchain technologies? 

Do any of you invest in these technologies?"
8,2016-04-05,americanpegasus,0,The Panama Papers: A bullish case for decentralized financial networks.,"You probably already know about the Panama Papers: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/panama-papers-explainer.html?_r=0  
  
But if you want to make money, you need to look a few steps ahead: the concept of the off-shore bank account is going away, ladies and gentlemen.  The traditional idea of financial privacy is being demolished by cooperative governments seeking to shine light on any who would hide any part of their assets.  
  
Now I am not hawking decentralized financial networks solely as a means to store wealth privately, but the fact remains - they are very good at that, among other things.  
  
Most have become so blinded to the truth of what money is they think it *must* come from the Federal Reserve or be printed on strips of paper.  They don't realize that money is a language like any other, and thanks to new technology we are now learning to speak 'money' on a level never before possible.  
  
We have, for the first time in human history, private and untraceable money that can be sent across the planet instantly, nearly for free, and without anyone's approval whatsoever.  *This has never happened before in the history of Earth.*  I can't emphasize that enough.  It also does other things well, like enable an individual to save wealth in a way that can only be seen if the individual permits it, and allows people to make unique contracts that can't be backed out of (but also that others don't have to know about).  
  
If you are not up to speed on the latest developments in blockchain technology, you are sorely behind in the field of money.  People will use this technology for many things, and it will succeed as a result of these synergistic network effects.

Hello again, 

A few days ago I submitted a half-brained post about the Ethereum blockchain that I felt did a *huge disservice* to a project that many in the tech world see similarities to that of what was happening in the days of the early 90s Internet in Silicon Valley. 

Since the inception of its whitepaper, many folks have been investing there time &amp; energy into developing potential uses case for the Ethereum network - such as decentralized cloud computing, resource sharing (Transgrid),  swarm intelligence/action/organizational networks (Backfeed, Colony), oracles (Oraclize), prediction markets (Augur, Gnosis), decentralized Reddit (Akasha), decentralized IoT, Smart city backbone, decentralized Voting systems (very timely ;), even a Supercomputer (Golem) built on the blockchain, and **so so much more**.  

Since Ethereum's blockchain coding language, Solidity, is Turing-complete, we cannot fully understand the complexity and scope of use cases that will come about from all the synergy of these decentralized applications and smart contracts.  Please take a look at some of these DEVCON2 (Annual Ethereum development conference) videos and all the development going on in this blockchain 2.0 space.  

I had posted the wrong link for Devcon2 videos in that previous post as well.  My apologies. See the link above for the corrected link.

Also check out these podcasts ---&gt; [The Ether Review] (https://soundcloud.com/arthurfalls) , [State Change](https://media.consensys.net/state-change-podcast/), and [Epicenter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh-0T48JrvvmKDX41aWB_Vg)

20,2016-10-23,PuddingwithRum,8,Advice for an investment in the field of IoT,"*I obviously invested myself, which is one reason I'm sharing this with you.*

I know that people tend to stop reading if ""Bitcoin"" is mentioned, this case however is different. 

As the term ""Internet of things"" comes up more and more, the tech behind it is developing fast. 

The following post aims for investors as well as developers to become a part of an interesting project. 

-&gt; IOTA. 

IOTA is an evoluted Blockchain-technology, like Bitcoin but more sophisticated. 

Crypto-currencies differ in subject to their field of action. Some are made for security- and anonymity-reasons, some are made as data carrier. 

While Bitcoin, as the most prominent one, aims to replace currencies, IOTA is made for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).

Iota's focus lies in the interconnectedness of devices to enable micropayment in short timeframes or: “to be the backbone of the IoT”

Why the name IOTA? It refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet which is often used as “a slightest amount”. Furthermore the obvious similarity to IoT, hence the nomenclature. 

It operates on the Tangle, an evoluted Blockchain which has countless strong distinctions from a Blockchain to fit perfectly for the IoT. 

The biggest difference lies in the taxation of transactions, which is at 0.0001 BTC for Bitcoin transactions, but completely free for an IOTA- transaction. 

There are no blocks within the Tangle, and mining is not possible.

This disparity is of big importance in the world of Internet of Things as fees would handicap the transaction-environment of billions of devices. 

Further reading including a technical comparison between the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Tangle can be found here: https://medium.com/iotatangle

The scientific technical description of the Tangle can be read here:	 https://www.iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf

**To draw a conclusion:** For the first time ever, through IOTA people can transfer money without any fees. This means that even infinitesimally small nano-payments can be made through IOTA - worldwide.

IOTA is the missing puzzle piece for the Machine Economy to fully emerge and reach its desired potential. We (The devs. I'm not a dev) envision IOTA to be the public, permission-less backbone for the Internet of Things that enables true interoperability between all devices. 

A revolutionary, innovative solution for a Billion Dollar market. 

Important info for investors: IOTA is no pump&amp;dump-scheme, therefor it's right now, not possible to invest in it through exchanges, even though it's already 1 year in development. 
Exchanges will be green-lighted in a few weeks. Enough time to read about it. However, investing is possible through OTC-trading in the #trading - channel in slack. 


Feel free to ask, I'll try to answer everything.
