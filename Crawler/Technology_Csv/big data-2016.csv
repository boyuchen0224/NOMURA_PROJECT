0,2016-01-11,americanpegasus,0,Here's why it's time to invest in Bitcoin in these crazy markets (TheStreet.com),"TheStreet posted a pretty basic article with this title recently, hitting a few key points and overlooking some others.

Yes, Chinese and others looking for hard assets will find a safe refuge in Bitcoin that will only propel it's price higher as more people look to acquire it.  This is the Speculative stage of money, and Bitcoin would be no better than a common stock or gold if this were true.  
  
But they are ignoring key components of cryptocurrency: the ability to transcend its role as a speculative vehicle and create an actual transactional economy.  Some may argue that not much of a transactional economy can emerge with Bitcoin's current blocksize limitations, but there are many advanced protocols and proposals to fix that in the works.  As well there are many other amazing features, such as the ability to write data securely in a way that it can never be altered (still every computer around the world running Bitcoin has a copy of my poem I wrote last year, and they will forever as long as Bitcoin has value).  
  
Anyway, Bitcoin has essentially doubled its price in the past three months and I don't care how you want to spin it: that chart looks healthy - http://i.imgur.com/M8lXVZc.jpg  
  
2016 may be the year of the next big Bitcoin run... Remember, to create a decentralized and global financial network from nothing it **must** slowly rise from nothingness and undergo several dramatic expansion cycles (by price).  There is no other way to realistically do it.  
  
In other words, you cannot create a secure, global, and decentralized financial network without accidentally making a few people very wealthy - that is why Bitcoin makes such an attractive investment.  "
1,2016-01-08,workinreddit,7,Does this not worry anyone else?,"I posted this as a response in another topic but figured more people would see it this way.

There's a stone cold assumption that the stock market is fairly priced now but what data are you guys look at to support that?

The market expansion in recent years was due to the expansion of P/E ratios and not earnings. Now that free money(QE) has stopped these ratios will contract to more reasonable values.

Look at a company like PG as a perfect example because it's a stock that will generally be a steady eddy during downturns. In 2007 it sold at a P/E of 22.6, a bit high for a mature company. It fell down to 16.8 with the market crash in 2008 - a reasonable P/E for a mature company if a bit high. Then it rose and rose and it's now at a 26.5 as of 2015. How is that reasonable for a mature company that's growing their earnings in the single digits. Analysts expect a 6% earnings contraction in 2016 and then 5yr growth in the 7% range. That seems like a steep price to pay for that type of growth. 
This stock market has a ways to go before the fundamentals no longer support a big reduction.

People flocked to stocks because there's no alternative investments due to low interest rate and cheap debt. Companies leveraged up on cheap debt and will likely tank hard when and if the economy starts to contract. A 26 P/E for a company like PG(a great company no doubt) is freaking steep by any sort of historical measure. Sure you can say that historical measures no longer apply because of current economic conditions but I totally don't agree. "
2,2016-01-08,dennisrieves,1,Whats happening in China .................................................,"It's important to put the current situation in context. 

A 7% drop is a very serious drop because based on statistical inference if the total exchange is at -7% it means that many stocks have already reached their daily limit of -10%. This drop because it happened so early into the trading day is an historically large market crash, much steeper than 1929 or 1987. 

The market in China is made up mostly of inexperienced retail investors and traders so it runs on emotion and is probably the least reflective of actual underlying business and economic conditions of any stock market in the world. 

It is a cause for concern given the weakness in both their manufacturing and non manufacturing PMIs, both the official and the Caixin. It is the timing of the stock market rout and the PMIs that raises more concern with this selloff. 

The increasingly rapid drop in the Yuan is an extremely important tell that the economic managers over there are circling the wagons. 

The trade figures are due out in a few days. My guess is they would show even more deterioration than we have seen so far. 

Also that the government made an early move to block selling by major stockholders underscores the seriousness of the crash and connects it to the PMI data and the exchange rate. All this suggests the economic problems may be much deeper than it appears from any data. 

I have maintained for a while that we are in a hard landing. That has to be distinguished from both a soft landing and a crash landing or economic collapse. 

We had a hard landing in late 2008 and the economic numbers were a lot worse. We had real sequential loss for one quarter. That is a long way down from 7% growth estimates. 

The base case right now would be something akin to 2008, the equivalent of a moderate recession in the US. which is a big deal for a country which has not had one since its been industrialized. 

Now that we have gotten this far into the hard landing and are virtually certain their economic numbers lack a grounding in reality, the door must be opened for the first time to a crash landing. 

Right now the major probability is they will have a hard landing. However there is also maybe a 5% chance there will be a crash landing, that is something worse than we had in 2008. 

While this is terrible for commodities and materials stocks, it will have very little effect on the US. My best estimate would be it hurts the US GDP by a maximum of ~0.3%. It will also not have a major effect on US companies overseas profits. China accounts for only a small portion of those profits, less than 10%. There is very little US bank exposure over there to the best of my knowledge. 

Its possible European banks have a lot more exposure. The EU particularly Germany also has lot more exposure to foreign trade with China than we do. 

All this suggests to me buy US stocks on the downside move, whenever you think the time is right.
"
3,2016-01-04,dennisrieves,1,It's a global market rout,"It's 2016's first day of trading, and markets around the world are getting slammed.

The US stock market is plunging with the Dow down 450 points (2.6%), S&amp;P 500 down 52 points (2.5%), and Nasdaq down 155 points (3.0%).

Europe is getting smoked, with Britain's FTSE 100 down 2.2%, Germany's DAX down 4.1%, and France's CAC 40 down 2.5%.

The big headline maker was China, where the CSI 300 stock market index crashed 7% before markets were halted for the day.

Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng followed China lower, closing down 3.0% and 2.7%, respectively.

New data out of China confirmed that manufacturing in the world's second-largest economy was still contracting. The Caixin-Markit manufacturing PMI unexpectedly fell to 48.2 in December from 48.6 in November. The official NBS manufacturing PMI stood at 49.7 in December. (Any reading below 50 signals contraction.)"
4,2016-02-25,domecraft1,9,Due Diligence: AmTrust Financial Services,"This is my first serious DD, and I'd like a critique on what I did well and how I could improve. I'd like to have a career in the future becoming a fund manager and I think this is a good way to start. All of the information included was obtained from nasdaq.com and SEC filings from the from the company.

I am 16 years old and I am currently looking for strong long-term (10-15 years) investments. The following company is one that I'm interested in. Tell me what you think.

*Note: I do not own any shares of AmTrust. Please do the proper research before investing in any companies that I recommend.* 


**Company:** AmTrust Financial Services

Date: *2/24/2016*

**Stock Ticker**: AFSI

**Sector**: Financial

**Industry**: Property and Casualty Insurance

**Company Statistics vs Industry-Wide Stats**

AmTrust stock has a much better value than the average company stock in the property and casualty insurance industry based off of multiple factors 

First, its P/E ratio. Using data off of Yahoo Finance, AmTrust has a P/E ratio of 9.05 compared to the average P/E ratio of 19.1 for other stocks in the industry. Also attractive to the value investor is AmTrust's return on equity, which is 20.43% compared to the industry standard of 9.2%. 

AmTrust has a P/B value of 1.98, which is about par for property/casualty insurance companies which, on average, have a P/B ratio of 2. 

AmTrust also has strong profit and operating margins, 10.8% and 12.67% respectively, as well as a high quarterly year on year revenue growth of 15.40%. 

AmTrust has a dividend yield of 2.36% vs. the industry standard of 2.8%. However, I believe this small difference in price yield is more than made up for by the higher ROE and lower P/E ratio AmTrust has compared to other property/casualty insurance companies. 

**What exactly does AmTrust do?**

AmTrust underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance products such as workers' compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and extended service and warranty coverage, in the United States and internationally to niche customer groups that, generally, are underrepresented in the insurance market. 

The company strategy is to target niche, small and middle-sized customers using in the United States and Europe using a proprietary technology platform to efficiently manage the high volume of policies and claims that they receive. 

AmTrust approaches acquisitions conservatively by taking modest balance sheet risks, including acquiring companies, access to distribution networks, and hirings of established teams of insurance underwriters.

**Strengths and Future Opportunities**

A big strength of AmTrust is its key statistics compared to companies in the industry, indicating that the company stock is undervalued. 

Another big strength is the proprietary technology that AmTrust uses, which allows the company to ""appropriately price and structure policies, maintain lower levels of loss, enhance [their] ability to accurately predict losses, and maintain lower claims costs than the industry as a whole."" Wherever possible, AmTrust adjusts the terms, conditions, and exclusions of their coverage to manage their risk and increase their profitability. 

Another part of AmTrust's strength is the fact that the company targets niche customers where the market is not as competitive as the broader market and where AmTrust's level of expertise provides them with a distinct advantage over other competitors in the industry.

AmTrust and its principal insurance subsidiaries are rated ""Excellent"" by an independent organization, A.M. Best Company, an organization that analyzes insurance companies. ""Excellent"" is A.M. Best Company's third highest of 16 rating levels.

AmTrust's effective and robust policies are shown through the company's high retention rates for its insurance policies, with an average policy renewal rate of 86% for the years of 2014,2013, and 2012.

AmTrust has strong future earnings potential, with analysts predicting that over the next 5 years the company will grow earnings at an average annual rate of 11%. http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/earnings-growth



**Weaknesses and Risks**

AmTrust is currently involved in several class action lawsuits filed in February 2014 in the southern district of New York. According to their 10-K SEC filing, the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss. This lack of loss estimates suggests that perhaps there are potentially large losses at risk and that the company does not want to erode stakeholder confidence. That being said, I believe the claims made by litigators are unsubstantiated. The cases are currently in appeal, but judges have ruled in AmTrust's favor in the past. 

Volatile financial markets could adversely affect their business operations, financial positions, and liquidity. In the case of an economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could negatively impact confidence in the company.

There are no policy limits on Amtrust's liability for worker's compensation claims unlike other forms of insurance. In the event of catastrophic losses or a force majeure, AmTrust could theoretically be forced to pay out significant amounts of money to the workers they insure.

A large amount of Amtrust's money (About $4.25 billion or 77% of their investment portfolio) is concentrated into fixed income securities. In general, the market value of fixed income securities decrease as interest rates rise. Conversely, when interest rates decrease the market value of the securities increase. According to their filing, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $207.3 million decrease in Amtrust's investments. 

**Economic Moats**

What makes AmTrust much more effective at producing returns and reducing risks is through how its business is structured. AmTrust has three business segments: Small Commercial Business, Specialty and Extended Warranty Risk, and Specialty Program. AmTrust's moat comes in its small commercial business side of the company, with its small commercial business segment making up 49.3% of their gross written premium in 2014, 40.3% in 2013, and 34% in 2012. 

The small business segment for worker's comp, which continues to increasingly take up a majority of the companie's gross written premium, is less competitive for the large insurance market because of the lower average premium and smaller policy which do not fit the profitability criteria of their customers. This allows AmTrust to work in a niche market that allows them to make money consistently and obtain a portion of the market share that other insurance companies are restricted from.





**Analyst Ratings**

Although I take analyst ratings with a grain of salt, some people may find them to be insightful. To that end, all of the analyst ratings for AmTrust have been positive. According to: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/recommendations  

Out of 5 analysts, 4 gave it a strong buy and 1 gave it a buy.

**Overall**

I give AmTrust Financial Services a BUY rating based off of several factors: its favorable P/E and ROE, its strong future earnings potential, and the unique way the business is structured to target niche clients in an underrepresented market. I believe the market is currently undervaluing AmTrust because of lower consumer confidence in the financial markets, and that the recent dip in its price is not based off of fundamentals.

5,2016-02-19,JennyRebekka,3,The Fed Is Handcuffed &amp; Markets Could Drop 30%,"The Federal Reserve is potentially in big trouble after this mornings CPI (Consumer Price Index) Report. While the headline number came in at 0%, the core (minus food and energy) came in at 0.3%. This was slightly more inflation than expected and if we start seeing this trend continue, it kills any chance of negative interest rates as an option for the Federal Reserve. Negative interest rates was the last silver bullet the Federal Reserve had in its arsenal, after years of quantitative easing (printing money) and zero interest rate policy. Note: Japan has done it recently, so far without any benefit.

 

While the markets are not worried about it at this point (1 data point does not make a trend), it is likely any future inflation signals along with any weakening economic indicators will panic the market to the tune of a full 25-30% correction off of the all time highs on the S&amp;P 500. My projections show one more short squeeze to the upside to around the 2,000 level on the S&amp;P, followed by another bigger leg down to as long as 1,575."
6,2016-02-17,lidoisleadvisors,3,SP500 Continues Rally; Oil up over 6%,"**Equities:** The MAR16 SP500 is up 1.6% to 1920, continuing a blistering rally starting last week. We actually have the next major resistance level at 1990. This is about 3.5% above current levels. We would not be surprised to see that level approached within the next 2 months. One theme we have noted is that it looks like the market does NOT like Janet Yellen. She does not seem to inspire confidence in the markets. However, recent economic data has been consoling and Fed voter Dudley has dissauded the market that negative rates in the US are an imminent possibility. The market seems to like that. Negative rates are not good for banks.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds continue their slide from the 170’s, now down another 1.7 points to 164’03. 162’10 looks like the next key moving average support level. Once the stock market showed strength, the bonds really started to tumble!

**FX:** The MAR16 USD is down slightly, basically unchanged on the day. We believe the USD will continue to rally this year and ultimately breach new highs and stay in the 100’s. We believe the Fed will hike rates at least one more time this year. The MAR16 Pound came back slightly this morning after a big down day yesterday.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI is up 6.4% to $30.91. The high 28’s, as we noted just yesterday, was phenomenal support for this contract. $28.75 turned out to be a key barrier. APR16 gold is up $4 today to $1212. $1220 may be a good short term magnet for gold. MAY16 coffee is up slightly to $1.1725. We believe coffee’s volatility will increase over the next few months and we believe the price will move to the upside. $127.50 is the 200 day MA which could be good resistance. If coffee can stay above that level, we believe it is in store for a big sustained rally to at least $1.50.

7,2016-02-03,cb_hanson,10,Basic investing principle: Think about the stock market as you would a bond.,"Reading the posts here in the past few weeks, I think a quick comment might be appropriate for how expected stock returns vary as prices change. My sense is that too many people here are focusing on the wrong thing hence my suggestion to think of the aggregate stock market as you would a bond.

What is the value of a bond? We know what the cash flows will be (the promised coupons + principal assuming no default). So given interest rates, it's simple to calculate the bond value as the present value of the cash flows.

Now what happens when the price of a bond goes down? The cash flows haven't changed so the expected returns from holding the bond to maturity must have gone up. So **Price Down =&gt; Returns Up.** The opposite (returns down) is true if the price of the bond goes up.

The very same concept applies to stocks. The value of a stock is the present value of cash flows (in this case, dividends and other distributions instead of interest payments). Suppose for a moment that the dividends are more or less fixed, but that the price moves around. If the price of stocks fall, then the expected return for stocks goes up (just as in the bond example).

*But hold you on, I hear you say.* If stock prices are going down, doesn't that mean that expected earnings (and hence dividends) are also going down. Yes, that's likely true as well. However, the key insight (which earned Robert Shiller his NP) is that **stock prices are too volatile compared to changes in fundamentals like dividends**. So when stock prices go way down, it's signaling that future dividends are likely to be lower. But since prices generally move more than is justified by the fall in dividends, the expected returns are still higher. This is a big part of why aggregate stock returns are predictable.

**TL;DR: When stock prices go down, expected returns generally go up.** (Note: the focus of this comment is the aggregate stock market, not individual stocks. And I'm not saying to buy every small dip.)

[For people who are already familiar with all this, keep in mind that this is an empirical observation. It doesn't necessarily need to be the case that discount rates are too volatile. In fact, in pre-WWII data in the US, changes in stock prices were driven more by changes to cash flows than changes to discount rates. This is also true if you look at non-US data going back several centuries. In other words, the relative importance of discount rate news is a pretty new phenomenon. One possible explanation is that equity duration has increased considerably in the past several decades due to fewer firms paying dividends. The implication for all you budding market timers is that thinking about discount rates might be more useful than poring over financial statements and forecasting earnings.]

I think that the housing market in my region is in a bubble condition. I want to to investigate this so that it's not just based on anecdotal evidence or second hand regurgitating of clickbait articles on the internet. 
  
What should I be reading or studying to get more information about the housing market as a whole? Everything I search just gives me articles that are mainly written around conclusions. I want to find out what data I should be looking at and read about debate on how that data should be interpreted. Can anyone point me in a good direction so that I don't feel so overwhelmed by the noise on the internet?
  
I feel like there is a chance that this might devolve into people debating the housing market. Let me just get this out of the way : I don't have any evidence, this is just a hunch. The purpose of this post is where should I look for evidence one way or the other. It's just as likely that the information proves me wrong and that's fine.

My stock analysis is not great, I try to look more into the company and the current state of the market as well while trying to improve my financial analysis.

Video games play more of a role in our lives today than they 
have in the years past.  Ten years ago we would sit glued to our TV’s or computer screens for hours on end gaming until we could no longer keep our eyes open.  Today, while it feels different, we still do something similar. Games are now played on our phones during our commute, while in the bathroom, or when just lounging around watching TV.  Our generation has become masters of multiple screens.  These games are cheaper as well, so companies who are creating these games are trying to find new and creative ways to monetize them.

Electronic Arts has a strong collection on both console games along with mobile.  Console franchises which include, Madden, Fifa, Star Wars, Battlefield, and The Sims, and a mobile lineup which includes Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled.  While not the strongest mobile offering of the publishers, EA finds a way to connect to a variety of gamers.

**EA Data Points**

**P/E:** 33.01 (Financial Sector Avg: 20.40)

**EPS:** 1.95

**Beta:** 0.68

**Market Cap:** 47.66B

**Net Profit Margin:** -4.21% (Tech Avg: 19.12%)

**52w Low/High:** 53.01 – 76.92

Why does EA have a negative profit margin?  That first data point quickly jumps out at you and requires additional investigation.  When reported in Dec 2015, the company had lower sales than the same time in 2014, and there were investments in certain games (Star Wars for one) that did not yet pan out.  As mentioned above, mobile has been a tough market for EA to get into and the market notices these things.

Two-year trend lines are on a slight decline after almost two years of active growth.  I think again; this has to do with the markets fear in what will EA do next?  I believe we will see a big name mobile acquisition sometime this year.  Depending on how much they spend on this company and how well they are doing will be a big game changer.

Financials aside, EA has been on quite a consumer journey over the past few years.  About three years ago they were one of the most hated companies in the United States with a reputation of unfinished or poorly updated games, as well as killing some fan favorite companies (RIP Maxis) they could not win over gamers.  Even won worst company in America two years in a row (2012/2013).

New management came in and started fixing all the leaks within the EA.  Today we sit here discussing a business that fans now believe and trust as one of the top-tier gaming companies.  The last step for EA is to create a new premium mobile franchise to escalate their portfolio.  Below you can see the profits of gaming companies, and while EA has a slim lead, however, VentureBeat predicts that by 2018 the mobile gaming market will hit $45B and surpass console gaming.

**Conclusion**

EA is one of the largest gaming companies in the world falling slightly behind Activision.  It would be hard to sit here and not recommend buying them, however even with such recognizable franchise names; this has not translated well into mobile yet.  It is strange when you think about games like The Sims which would be a perfect mobile game not yet existing (it probably exists but did not do well enough to stand out).  If EA wants to keep its position near the top, mobile is KEY, and while they’ve purchased big names such as Popcap, it seems we haven’t seen many mobile games from them recently."

-------------------------
###Background
Headquartered in **Santa Clara California** and employing **9100** **employees** worldwide Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market, as well as system on a chip units for the automotive market. Primary GPU product line:""GeForce"", is in direct competition with AMD's ""Radeon"" .

**Focus on: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Centers and Auto.**


In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers  efficiently run high-performance applications. Deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved out of the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. 

**In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.**

#$NVDA REPORT

###Capitalization

*Sector | Industry*: **Tech  | Semiconductors**

*Price as of Post* |  *YTD%*: **$45.70** | **43.43 %**

*Market Cap*:  **23.67B** : *Large Cap*

###Revenue, Profits, Margins (FY11 - FY16)
Revenue Trend: 3.54B --&gt; 5.01B = **+41.5%**

Earnings: 343M --&gt; 780M = **+127%**

Net Margin: 10% --&gt; 15% = **+50%**

Gross Margin: 44% --&gt; 56% = **+27%**

Revenue continues to grow, with earnings growth outpacing revenue growth showing good cost cutting and efficiency within, however OpProfit margin &lt;25% so still room for improvement in this regard, dominance over comp AMD in the GPU market with customers highly choosing NVDA over AMD so solid source of cash flows that will continue for foreseeable future, in addition to branching out to automotive tech and research based processors as well as a good foot in the VR door. NVDA will continue to increase its revenue in the near-mid future. 

###Comps

Up against AMD in the GPU market, have dominantly stolen market share from AMD and continues to take customers from the struggling company, **has gone from 62% share to 82%** in the GPU market since 2011, ADM on brink of collapse/bought out so in the core GPU market NVDA is very strong. $INTC and $QCOM are other comps but the other 2 don't really go head to head with NVDA has they focus on the CPU market vs NVDA's GPU base. **TLDR: RIP AMD**

###Multiples
* **P/E**: **41.83** *pretty high* *note: that '17-'18 ests come in around 30, '16 was a really good year for NVDA* : **INTC and QCOM both have P/E of 12-14 then of course AMD has -6**. Could be a good sign that investors expecting more growth in the company but could also mean company overpriced *(as we will see later this is **by my math* false)*. Could also be sign that INTC and QCOM underpriced, etc

* **P/B: 5.57:  INTC's = 2.42 QCOM=2.77** AMD = N/A ::SSDD as above

* **Entreprise Multiple: (EV/EBITDA) : 17.15**|| INTC: 6.88 , QCOM: 9.40 |||||So again NVDA leads the way and SSDD reasons as above, no one knows for sure (welcome to finance)||||| For valuation purposes EV/EBITDA range of 13-15x used has older companies begin to get lower EM's has keeping constant EM's become unsustainable.

###Management and Ownership

* 5% Insider
* 88% Institutional
* 7% us individual peasants

**CEO, President and Co-Founder ^(^^what ^^a ^^big ^^boi) : Jen-Hsun Huang** : founded NVDA in 1993, holds 7300 patent assets fundamental to modern computing, invented the GPU in 1999. Been with the company his whole life obviously and knows what the fuck he's doing clearly even if he has no experience elsewhere (other BOD hacks can cover this) Holds multiple awards regarding innovation, yadda yadda, guy has led this company to success so I see no wrong here and no negative

 **Co-founder: Chris A. Malachowsky**: 30 years industry EXP, key figure in the path the company goes down, has led numerous departments throughout his time with Nvidia like stated above Malachowsky has exp at HP (rip Fiorina) and Sun Microsystems so he has that outside edge that the CEO doesn't. Also won some Emmy in 2009??? So good for him I guess


**VP and CFO: Colette Kress** : Joined in 2013 after 25 years of xp at other tech companies (mirin). Including CFO at Cisco and CFO of MSFTs ""Server and Tools"" divison. Prior to that was at TI in a variety of roles. This girl living the dream (couldve went somewhere else for her MBA but whatcha gonna do now)

3 other BOD members but they all hold similar xp and shit

###Stock History (here's where we start to go south...)

*No preffered shares*

Stock chilling at 45.75 when I began writing this 45.8 right now. As we have all seen it has completely dominated this year and as we will see later is basically at the margin of error for fair value right now. This thing was a steal a few months ago but right now you have no guarantee of gains, this will be a buy the dip kind of stock.


###Expectations

The high analyst estimate is $50 (they have 1 year timeframes), I'm getting $51 with a very conservative estimates for intrinsic value based on current figures. You can still squeeze out 5-10% perhaps on this stock but is by now means a YOLO, unless you want to delve into some &lt;monthly all or nothing 50C play. Average estimate is where the stock is right now. 

###Risks

AMD makes a miraculous comeback (lol)

The more serious one is that VR doesn't do as well as people are thinking. Even with my conservative figures VR has to at least do ""ok"" for NVDA to grow at all. VR could make or break a play on NVDA, outlook looks good but this could become the next fad for all we know. 

### Conclusion

NVDA is a buy/hold, not a sell by no means, but also not a strong buy, as I will presented in my figures above it has 5-15% upside to it with 15% being really optimistic.

The company is strong and doing well, so go ahead and allocate 2%  (or 200% because what's the point to life without margin) of your portfolio towards NVDA, I myself am picking up at a Jan17 ATM call spread on the stock.

##Wait for a dip to buy in because it's not going much higher if at all 

Hope you guys enjoyed, week got busy af and I counted my chickens before they hatched so this was the most thorough one I got around to doing but will make my way through the list as I can.

13,2016-05-06,bmacorr,3,Thoughts on $DATA?,"The recent drop got me looking at this stock and I have to say a lot of the data from the recent earnings report look pretty good.  I see a lot of the concern is revolving around their declining profit margins and increased operating costs but at the same time cash-on-hand is increasing and the bulk of the inflated operating costs were tied up in Marketing/ R&amp;D.  

Some positive highlights I sifted through the earnings:

* 47% increase in Marketing 
* &gt;95% of increased operating costs are from Marketing/R&amp;D that could pay dividends in the coming quarters.
* increased cash-on-hand 13% increase, gives them flexibility to dump more money into marketing and potential acquisitions.
* better net operating margins (-3.5% vs -8% in 2015)


Some of the negatives:

* increased net loss
* decreased profit margins (-20% vs -12% in 2015)

My thoughts are that in general the company is losing money, but the increased spending in marketing and a fairly good control of general operating expenses and cash-in-hand seem to be positive signs for future growth.  I've personally heard people talking about their products where we're starting to work more with Big Data and I know a lot of clients are looking at it too.

Wondering what everyone else's views on it are.

14,2016-05-04,tickerjunkie,3,A look at Flexion Therapeutics $FLXN,"All Ticker Junkie analyses are up for discussion directly under its post. Feel free to leave constructive criticism. We are all here to assist and make one another better.

OA = Osteoarthritis http://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/types/osteoarthritis/what-is-osteoarthritis.php

Flexion has been on my eye since the new year. I listened to their most recent conference call a few times (http://ir.flexiontherapeutics.com/eventdetail.cfm?eventid=170651), and reviewed their pipeline especially their lead drug, Zilretta. It’s truly a tug on the brain when you hear medical terms that you actually know offhand when researching a company.

I have taken a quote from their website to describe Zilretta: “Flexion’s lead product candidate is a sustained-release intra-articular, non-opioid analgesic candidate targeting moderate to severe osteoarthritis (OA) pain. OA afflicts millions of people in the United States and accounts for over $185 billion of annual healthcare expenditures.” From what I can gather, their steroid is different than what is on today’s market because it releases into the patient over time rather than an all-in-one dosage. This release over time results in the steroid functioning in that particular area longer, and therefore more effectively. A quick note: the steroid used in Zilretta is already FDA approved, what Flexion needs to be approved is the dissolvable spheres that carry the steroid. A video on their website provides a visual of what their drug does: http://flexiontherapeutics.com/plga-video/


**Key Factors**
– Total Cash: 132.17M
– Share Outstanding: 21.57M
– Float: 15.12M Low float can be a bullish indicator as it means insiders and institutions hold a large sum of shares. What is float? http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/float.asp
– Insider transactions not looking real pretty with the largest holder NOVO Group selling off approximately 50% of their shares. http://finance.yahoo.com/q/it?s=FLXN+Insider+Transactions


**Pros**
– Zilretta, if approved would be marketable to approximately 25 million US patients, and these people “account for over $185 billion of annual healthcare expenditures.”
– Awarded a $2 million grant by the US Department of Defense to help their Zilretta phase 2 trial on service members with post-traumatic OA.
– “In June, data from our first phase 2b efficacy trial of Zilretta which demonstrated better and longer pain relief compared to the standard of immediate release TCA. Was published in the Journal of Bone and Joint surgery.”
– “Secured a $30 million non-dilutive debt financing with Silicon Valley bank and MidCap financial to provide the funding for the manufacturing expansion with Patheon.”
– In September 2015 the FDA had granted fast track status to Zilretta.
– “In February of this year we reported a positive top line phase 3 clinical trial data for Zilretta whereby it met its primary end-point at week 12.”


**Neutral**
– Signed an agreement with Patheon as the contract manufacturer for planned commercial manufacturing of Zilretta.
– “Published in the Journal of Bone and Joint surgery. A pre-eminent journal amongst orthopedic surgeons who are key decision makers in the management of OA patients.”
– Hired a pharmaceutical manufacturing operations executive (Scott Canute)
– Drugs with fast track designation generally qualify for quality review if supported by clinical data at the time of NDA filing thereby expediting the FDA review process. (If you want to follow/trade $FLXN be weary results MIGHT come out in-sync.)
– IMPORTANT “Zilretta demonstrated superiority to Placebo in pain relief beginning at week 1 continuing to week 11 an also at week 13 where p-value was less than 0.05 at each time point.” BUT week 12 “did not reach statistical significance with p-value of 0.0821.”
– Zilretta’s pain-relief comparison to immediate release steroids is not statistically different/significant, however it does last longer
– Upcoming meeting scheduled with the FDA to establish the file ability of an NDA for Zilretta.
– “Our confidence in the path of outcome from that meeting is bolstered by feedback we have received from experienced regulatory consultants who have reviewed the data under confidentiality.” “The reaction to the data was very enthusiastic.”


**Cons**
– “R&amp;D expenses to increase over the next several years due to late stage trials being conducted for Zilretta.”
– Week 12 showed a variation in expected results (as noted above), leads to some questioning


**Timeline**
“First, we have scheduled a pre-NDA meeting with the FA and we remain optimistic that they will view the totality of our clinical data as supportive of an NDA filing for Zilretta in the second half of 2016. Second, we expect to initiate a clinical trial of Zilretta in patients with OA of the knee who also have diabetes.”
– Note: “Approximately 20% patients with knee OA have diabetes in clinical trial data demonstrated when these patients when treated intra-articular injections of immediate release TCA as well as other corticosteroids can experience substantial elevation in blood glucose levels in the days post injection.”
– Another note: The clinical trial of Zilretta in patients with OA who also have diabetes began April 28th http://finance.yahoo.com/news/flexion-therapeutics-enrolls-first-patient-200500885.html


**Noteworthy Quotes**
“We believe that administration of Zilretta has the potential to avoid elevated blood glucose levels an thus be positioned to confer patients with diabetes not only better pain relief but improved safety as well.
“We expect that Zilretta could become frontline therapy for approximately 800,000 diabetic patients in the U.S. currently receiving immediate release steroids for OA of the knee.”


**Conclusion**
The overall sentiment I am left with on Flexion Therapeutics would be Bullish. There are definitely a couple question marks in this analysis and I realize that, but I believe these question marks are outweighed. This counterweight would be the sheer fact that the drug within the dissolvable spheres is already FDA approved. When I read that, I was intrigued by that fact that they only have to show statistical evidence of these dissolvable spheres having superiority over the existing dose. I also love some of the positives they mentioned such as having professionals anonymously review their clinical findings and showing “enthusiasm.” Another big upside is the number of people this drug would benefit, and for those with diabetes even more of a benefit. I believe their mission is achievable for the good of those with OA and investors alike.

15,2016-05-02,tickerjunkie,3,Biostage $BSTG,"Credit: Following analysis was developed in conjunction with Joel Cohen.

Biostage, formerly known as Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology $HART, has been making leaps and bounds in the last few months. I have had my eye on this company since last year, and have fallen in love with their doings. In 2016, they rebranded themselves as Biostage $BSTG, with a new slick website Biostage.com. I am no scientist, but I will do my best to break down what Biostage is all about.

Basically, what they do is a revolutionary method of organ regeneration. They use their “Cell Frame” technology which acts as a scaffold for the patient’s cells to grow around outside of the body. So, they are using the patient in need’s own cells to recreate an organ precisely prepared for them. Pretty cool stuff. I’ll leave the rest of the explaining to the company’s website.

**Fundamentals**
Biostage has a low float, around 12 Million shares. As a quick summary of float, float is the number of truly outstanding shares. Shares that you and I can buy on the market. So when a low float company comes out with good news, the amount of sellers are smaller than on a big name company like $AAPL because there are a lot less shares to be owned. What exactly is float? http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/float.asp

In addition, Biostage is performing large animal tests with the widely renowned healthcare company Mayo Clinic. Mayo Clinic is a big deal, they are ranked #1 in more specialties than any other hospital in the nation. So a little company like Biostage partnering with them on their trials is absolutely HUGE.

A quick list of some more positives:
– Zero debt financing
– Partial POSITIVE release of large animal data causing the stock price to soar in November 2015 http://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Harvard+Apparatus+(HART)+Announces+Significant+Results+For+Second+Generaton+Bioengineered+Implants/11065515.html
– Multiple additions to the team of experienced directors and additions to the development team.

There is much much more to be said about Biostage, but I do not want to spoil all of it for you. A quick listen to their most recent conference call on their website will have you in line to buy. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-hart-earnings-conference-132145294.html

16,2016-06-27,selleral,0,Why do you all think you can time the market?,"There is an overwhelming amount of data that shows you are not able to successfully time the market. You all speculate as if you have some inside information. 

Are you in it for the sport, or do you really not believe in market efficiencies? If not, do you not think that the big institutional investors are better suited to capitalize than you are? 

Not interested in hearing, ""well I bought this at X and now it's worth Y"" stories. Yes - if we are guessing which way a coin flips, half of you will be right. 

Active trading is not an economically wise long term strategy. The more you read-up, the worse. Buy low cost, index funds, rebalance, and stop looking at it. 

(Irony here is that my rant is largely inspired by warren buffet - perhaps the greatest ""stock picker"" of all time)
"
17,2016-06-27,duchessHS,3,New investor trying to pick the right online broker.,"Anyone got any advice?
I'm 29-years-old and looking to start parking my savings into stocks. The plan is to generally only make a handful (maybe 2-4) investments of several thousands per year (no day trading at all).

Based on my initial research, I've kind of narrowed my choices down to TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, or Fidelity. They all have fees that are on the higher end ($8-$10 per trade) but I keep hearing about their research tools being top notch. Can anyone clue me in on what exactly these research tools comprise of? Are we talking analyst reports that are actually substantive (rather than the regurgitated, meaningless metrics that you might usually find on, say, Seeking Alpha?) 

The way I see it, if the research and data available on these platforms are actually useful in helping you make smart investments, then the extra few bucks you pay for TD Ameritrade or Fidelity should not be a big deal.


Thoughts?"
18,2016-06-19,TheRealAntacular,7,$SQ: Another fatal mistake of mine?,"http://www.barrons.com/articles/square-stock-likely-to-set-new-lows-1466224191

&gt; However, some ask whether Square is making it too easy. For instance, Square acts as the retailers’ agent and pays the 20-cent fee per transaction that businesses would normally forward to payment systems managers such as  Visa  (V). Square’s 2.75% fee is higher than that of rivals like Heartland Payment Systems,  Global Payments  (GPN),  Vantiv  (VNTV), and  First Data  (FDC). They tend to charge about 1.75%, but don’t absorb the 20-cent fee. 

&gt; That doesn’t sound like much, **but it can be the margin between making or losing money on small transactions.** A $5 purchase at a retailer would net Square 14 cents. But once it handed over the 20-cent fee, **Square would register a six-cent loss.**

&gt; “You simply can’t serve this segment of the market at the price points that Square uses,” says Wedbush’s Luria. Square CFO Friar argues that at its **roughly $53 average transaction** value the 20-cent fee doesn’t make a big difference, noting that the company focuses on aggregate values. **She declined to say how big a portion of transactions fall below $10.**

I got in on this early, around $14, but now it seems that they can't compete on low end transactions ($10-ish), but focusing on ""average"" transactions of $53. Yet they continue to bleed cash. I think the difference between the avg and the low end (possibly the ""mean"" [?]), is due to, what I believe the numeratii identify as ""skew."" Really wanna double down on this, can someone confirm/deny??

# Description
Robert Half International provides specialized staffing and risk consulting services. It operates through three segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing, and risk consulting and internal audit services. 

## Recent financials 

Given the economic backdrop, it's not surprising to see how well sales and profits are doing!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $5.1bn | $4.7bn | $4.2bn | $4.1bn | $3.8bn|
|EPS | $2.69 | $2.26 | $1.83 | $1.50 | $1.04|

## Competition

&gt; The Company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates. The most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel.

Given that description it's pretty remarkable to see the margins are returns of $RHI. Clearly the management team is doing something right!

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Robert Half International Inc. | $5,192M | 12% | 36%
CDI Corp. | $962M | N/A | -ve
Kelly Services, Inc. | $5,547M | 2% | 7%
Kforce Inc. | $1,329M | 6% | 31%
ManpowerGroup Inc. | $19,375M | 4% | 16%
Resources Connection, Inc. | $595M | 9% | 9%

## Cash / Debt?
Robert Half International Inc. has $213M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 4% of the market value of $RHI. I wonder if that's the right thing to do, given how the industry can get pummelled in a recession!

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $46.89 for Robert Half International Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 14% to their target.

# Valuation

The PE ratio isn't racy, the FCF yield is good and the stock pays a dividend. Okay the other big player, MAN is a little cheaper, but does that just reflect it's business mix, profitability and returns?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/rhi/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
RHI | $5,381M | 14x | 9% | 2% | 10%
CDI | $125M | -ve | N/A | 0% | -ve
KELYA.O | $791M | 13x | N/A | 0% | 12%
KFRC.O | $536M | 12x | N/A | 0% | 12%
MAN | $5,033M | 12x | 9% | 2% | 13%
RECN.O | $551M | 18x | N/A | 0% | 8%

# Dividends
$RHI's forecast to pay a dividend of $0.87 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.82 per share. That is a 6% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.87 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.95. So lots of room there. And management seems to be using any excess cash to repurchase stock.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -2%., so a little slippage in it's PE ratio, though on a 6 and 12 month view the stocks gone sideways with earnings doing up. i.e. the PE multiples been falling. 

Is that a reflection of people thinking the cycle is near the top? That we are nearing peak earnings? Strange if so, as the last 3 months saw sales up 8% with growth across all divisions.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/rhi/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; We feel we will continue to benefit from a widening skills gap in a number of our professional specialty areas. Employers that are struggling to find needed talent are recognizing that flexible staffing can help them manage total labor costs and also increase the pool of potential full time talent through temporary-to-hire arrangements.

So they don't see any headwinds for the business. And their risk-management / audit consulting arm, Protiviti is doing particularly well. Seems like the only thing to worry about is the economy?

Finance is really not the same as any other business. Just look at the smooth ""net interest income"" and the hideous ""realized and unrealised gains / losses"".

No wonder the EPS is a rollercoaster with multiple loop the loops. And still the dividends keep coming, with the net effect that shareholders equity continues to dwindle.

## Competition

From their SEC filing

&gt; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of these securities. In acquiring our target assets, we will compete with financial institutions, institutional investors, other lenders, government entities and certain other REITs. 

So, here's the data we get from Reuters. But frankly, it really doesn't mean a lot to me :(

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. | $781M | 15% | N/A
American Capital Agency Corp. | $174M | -ve | -ve
Starwood Property Trust, Inc. | $753M | 33% | 9%
New Residential Investment Corp | $812M | 43% | 16%
Chimera Investment Corporation | $831M | 69% | 8%
MFA Financial, Inc. | $545M | 57% | 10%
Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc | $470M | 45% | 11%
Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc | $603M | 49% | -ve

## Cash / Debt?
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. has $60,670M of net debt. That is 518.5x it's latest operating profit. Again, the actual debt levels are pretty meaningless in Financials... or at least they don't make any sense to me.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $10.91 for Annaly Capital Management, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 1% to their target. So Wall Street isn't hot on this stock

# Valuation

Then we get to the valuation. Given REITs have to pay out their cashflow to maintain their tax status, it's hard for the PE and divie to diverge. 

But the tax situation is more complicated, as the REIT doesn't pay corporate and income taxes, instead the shareholder does. So an 11% yield from $NLY isn't the same as 11% from a widget maker.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/nly/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:
NLY | $9,989M | 9x | -7% | 11% 
AGNC.O | $6,484M | 9x | N/A | 12% 
STWD.K | $5,093M | 11x | 6% | 9% 
NRZ | $3,088M | 7x | -1% | 14% 
CIM | $3,054M | 7x | 2% | 13% 
MFA | $2,779M | 10x | 2% | 11% 
BXMT.K | $2,700M | 11x | 3% | 9% 
IVR | $1,598M | 8x | -1% | 11% 

# Dividends
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.17 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.20 per share. That is a decline of 3%. The forecast dividend of $1.17 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.21. Which isn't a shock given REITs having to payout their cashflow.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 5%. On 6 month basis the stock's up 22% even though the earnings are only up 5%. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nly/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; In my remarks last quarter I also discussed our outlook for 2016. I stated that because of our diversified platform and low leverage profile, we were positioned to, take advantage of current market volatility, expected industry dislocations and the unforeseen opportunities we've been waiting for. I was signaling the benefits of and our desire for enhanced size and diversification in this volatile world.

So what did they do...they decided to buy another mortgage REIT, Hatteras. The deal will close later this year and perhaps it will give then increased scale? Cost synergies? A new pipeline of mortgage assets to acquire?

But is this all moot? Is it really just a play on interest rates and mortgage prepayments? A ""leveraged"" play? I don't get a lot of confidence from the CEO's comment that they want to get big and diversify ""in this volatile world"". 

Not my kind of investment, not a ""widows &amp; orphans stock"", is it. But would love to hear why anyone on this subreddit is a fan. Happy to be persuaded! :)

Teva's a king in the generic drugs business. i.e. they wait until drug patents expire and they then produce low cost versions. They help get those drugs to a massive audience who otherwise weren't able to afford the high cost on-patent drugs. Nice!

Though the big one to watch with Teva is probably the closing of their mega deal to buy Actavis Generics, from Allergan. Was supposed to close in March, then June...

# Description
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited is a global pharmaceutical company. The Company is engaged in developing, producing and marketing generic medicines and a portfolio of specialty medicines. 

## Recent financials 

It's been an uneventful few years at the top line. Though earnings have been less than exciting :(

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $19.7bn | $20.3bn | $20.3bn | $20.3bn | $18.3bn|
|EPS | $1.82 | $3.56 | $1.49 | $2.25 | $3.09|

## Competition

From their SEC filing:

&gt; We are subject to intense competition in the generic drug market from domestic and international generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies through lifecycle management initiatives, authorized generics, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. Price competition from additional generic versions of the same product typically results in margin pressures. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are our ability to continually introduce new and complex generic equivalents for brand-name drug products on a timely basis, our quality, our customer service and the breadth of our product portfolio. 

It seems that the cost of manufacturing generics continues to decline. Therefore distribution will be increasingly important. I can only imagine a scale player like TEVA has an advantage.

It's margins are pretty good versus the pure-play competitors though returns aren't that impressive.

|Generics Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) | $19,480M | 31% | 6%
Allergan plc | $16,304M | 27% | -ve
Mylan NV | $9,749M | 31% | 8%
Dr.Reddy's Laboratories Ltd (ADR) | $2,305M | 27% | 17%
Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc | C$13,521M | 46% | -ve

Surprisingly, if we look at the 3 pharma majors with big generic businesses, the margins compare nicely. 

|Mainstream|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Novartis AG (ADR) | $49,995M | 31% | 9%
Pfizer Inc. | $50,992M | 38% | 12%
Sanofi SA (ADR) | $38,271M | 31% | N/A

So maybe copying is just as good as inventing? ;)

## Cash / Debt?

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) has $4,236M of net debt. That is 0.7x it's latest operating profit. Not a lot to get worries about there. But after the Actavis deal the situation is going to be markedly different. With FCF going to pay off debts in 2017,2018,2019 they think they'll get back to 1.1x debt by end of 2019.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $69.43 for Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 28% to their target.

# Valuation

And at 10x forecast earnings, I can see why Wall Street has a sweet spot for $TEVA. It doesn't take a lot of positive sentiment to push that, especially if it earnings surprise.

However, one thing that looks odd is the low FCF yield. How does a 10% earnings yield become a 5% FCF yield and only a 2% dividend yield? 

Aside: Valeant's figures look like Wall Street's forgotten to update them!

[Generics Companies](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/teva.k/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
TEVA.K | $49,810M | 10x | 5% | 2% | 5%
AGN | $96,686M | 17x | 10% | 0% | 4%
MYL.O | $23,146M | 9x | 14% | 0% | 8%
RDY | $9,064M | 26x | 9% | 1% | 5%
VRX.TO | C$10,372M | 3x | 20% | 0% | 7%

And in contrast the mainstream pharma boys have higher PEs but seem to convert to both cashflow and dividends a lot better. Anyone have a view why?

Mainstream|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
NVS | $215,182M | 17x | 6% | 3% | 9%
PFE | $222,216M | 15x | 8% | 3% | 9%
SNY | $106,756M | 14x | 5% | 4% | 12%

# Dividends
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.29 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.36 per share. That is a -5% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.29 compares to a forecast EPS of $5.31.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -5% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -4%. So no real surprise there. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/teva/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. On the latest call they gave a view on the 2016 to 2019 period, which is pretty rare for a US listed company to do. 
&gt; EPS between 6.9 to 7.4 in 2019 

Versus $5.31 for 2016, that's a pretty nice boost.

Though in terms of catalysts
* I can't help believe that the market doesn't like the uncertainty on when the deal closes. It's a massive purchase (circa $35 to 40bn price tag, when their own market value is just $50bn).
* Plus allergan will end up with 100m shares, just under 10% stake and it's hard not to see them dumping those shares, when their lock-up agreement ends
* Also the major jump in earnings is synergies related. So proof they can squeeze out the synergies faster is likely to be well received.

**Executive Summary**

Apple Inc. was founded more than 40 years ago and has experienced tremendous growth. They began by developing and manufacturing personal computers and have grown into one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. With great success comes great expectations, and investors have a tendency to punish Apple (AAPL) if they don’t significantly beat expectations. They are currently trading 28% below its 52 week high.

This paper will discuss their 2016 Q2 results, interpret their financials, explain their different revenue streams, discuss their future direction, and will recommend a buy, sell, or hold recommendation. There are many people that will tell you that Apple is a one-trick-pony, that if their iPhone sales slowdown, they will fall just like tech companies of the past have. The bears like to compare Apple to other historical models like Blackberry, IBM, or Microsoft. These historical models suggest that Apple cannot retain their large growth forever and will eventually slow as their innovation and sales stagnate. 

Earlier this week, on April 16, 2016, Apple posted its first quarterly loss in more than 13 years. This can be attributed to economic factors in China, slowing iPhone sales, and a slightly weaker gross profit margin. The strong dollar is a major reason why Apple didn’t meet revenue expectations, as the majority of their weakness is in Hong Kong. iPhone sales were also down from a year ago in Q2 2015. While many analysts think Apple is a cyclical company that relies solely on their iPhone sales, I will explain throughout this paper why Apple is much more than simply the iPhone. With $50.6B in revenues, an EPS of $1.90, and a P/E of 10.08, Apple is a strong buy at $94.83 a share.      

**Article Summary**

In an article published on April 26, 2016, the New York Times reports Apple’s Q2 results and suggests reasons why Apple missed earnings expectations for the first time in over a decade. “The technology company’s dazzling 13-year run of quarterly revenue growth ended on Tuesday 
— a casualty of Apple’s already immense size, weakness in key global markets like China and 
the lack of another hot product to pry open the wallets of customers” (Goel, 2016). While the 
article provides the raw data from the earnings results, the author also projects a bearish sentiment to it. “Nearly half of the smartphones sold in the United States are iPhones, and Apple may be reaching the saturation point among potential customers in other developed countries” (Goel, 2016). It should be noted that this is mere speculation. Although Apple owns over half of the smartphone market here in the US, Apple is still expanding into emerging markets. Apples dominance will continue to chip away at the Android market and bring new customers into their ecosystem. The article points out Apple’s revenue decline from one year ago, “declined 13 percent to $50.6 billion as sales of its flagship product, the iPhone, fell, with little else to take its place” (Goel, 2016). The article reports that Apple sold 16% less iPhones than the same quarter last year. The higher revenues a year ago can be easily explained if you consider the iPhone upgrade cycles. Every two years a new iPhone is launched, and the years between Apple releases small upgraded features to the same model. In September of 2014 they released the iPhone 6, their first device with a larger screen. “The company has just announced that it set a ""new record"" after selling 10 million units of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 units combined during their three-day launch weekend beginning Sept. 19” (Arce, 2016). It would make sense why iPhone 6 sales are spilling over into 2015 Q2 numbers. The 2016 Q2 period is coming off of the iPhone 6S upgrade cycle, where less customers are upgrading their phones compared to 2015 Q2. In September of 2016 Apple will release their newest iPhone, the iPhone 7. 

The article also uses another negative opinion from an outside analyst, “There’s no question that Apple’s best days are behind it,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at the Bernstein brokerage firm. “The company grew at astronomical rates, and it’s now so big that its ability to grow at those rates doesn’t exist anymore.” (Goel, 2016). The analyst holds a popular industry-wide opinion: Apple cannot maintain its current growth. Despite the fact that Apple is being beaten down by Wall Street and suffering from global economic concerns, I will clearly explain why Apple is a clear and strong buy. 

**Interpreting the Financials**

The second quarter results were not in line with analyst expectations. “The Company posted quarterly revenue of $50.6 billion and quarterly net income of $10.5 billion, or $1.90 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $58 billion and net income of $13.6 billion, or $2.33 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 39.4 percent compared to 40.8 percent in the year-ago quarter” (Hoover, 2016). That’s a Q2 drop 12.79% from the same quarter one year ago. But a 10.96% increase from the same quarter two years ago. Their EPS is down 
18.45% from a year ago, but up 14.45% from the same quarter two years ago. Despite this Q2 miss, Apple’s gross profit margin decreased by 3.43%, but over the past year they have increased their NPM by 5.73%. During the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook announced more money being brought back to the shareholders. They announced an additional $50 billion to their program to return capital back to shareholders; they authorized $40 billion towards share buy backs, and a 10% increase in their quarterly dividend. Apple likes returning money to its shareholders, which can be seen with their high ROE ratio. ROE is up 49.76 from 2013, and 26.31% from 2014. 

During the conference all Apple’s CEO said, “Our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds” (Hoover, 2016). It was reported that international sales accounted for 67% of the quarter’s revenue, which could explain the missed revenue growth for the past few quarters. If more than half the revenues are hurt by the strong dollar, Apple looks rather strong considering they still pulled in $50 in revenue. 

Their $230 billion in cash is located overseas and would have to pay the full 35% corporate tax to bring it back to the US. This cash isn’t just sitting there; it’s placed into long-term marketable securities earning interest. To avoid paying all the taxes to bring the money back to the US, Apple announced in February of 2016 that they would issue $10-12 billion of bonds to finance share buybacks and dividends. “Apple said that the proceeds from the deal would be used for “general corporate purposes” including “repurchases of our common stock and payment of dividends under our program to return capital to shareholders” (Jackson, 2016). It’s cheaper for them to issue debt than to use their own cash, plus they get a tax write off for the interest expense. 
To show how strong Apple’s financials are, I will be comparing them with two of their largest competitors: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MFST). Although Apple has many competitors, I believe these two companies are the only ones that have a real shot at taking market share from them. Microsoft has been very successful with software and licensing, and has recently released their new Surface device. The Surface has been very popular and has given Microsoft some hope in competing with Apple’s iMacs. Their Windows phones however don’t pose any serious threat to the iPhone, and will most likely never catch on. I believe Alphabet is Apple’s #1 competitor. They’re both valued at around $500 billion and focus heavily on research and developing grandiose innovations. “Even though they compete across a huge range of subindustries, such as computing software, hardware, operating systems, mobile devices, advertising, applications and Web browsing, each firm takes a different approach from an organizational and philosophical perspective” (Ross, 2015). You can see that all three companies have high gross profit margins, but Apple achieves a slightly high net profit margin. 
Apple has always had incredibly high gross profit margins and maintained high net profit margins throughout the years. Their 2016 Q2 reported NPM of 22.87%.  What’s more impressive, is their ability to maintain high net profit margins year after year. In the past 12 quarters Apple has seen steady improvements in their NPM. These steady margins are attributed to their excellent management. You can see how well Apple has been managing their assets and improving their net profit margins. Compared to their competitors, their ratios are significantly better. These ratios show how effective Apple’s management is with supply chain management and asset turnover. These high gross profits and stand-out ratios are reasons why Apple has looked so attractive to investors. Their ROA increased from 17.04% in 2014 to 18.38% in 2015, an increase of 7.86%. They charge higher prices compared to their competition, and they maintain high gross margins, year after year. 

As mentioned before, investors hold Apple to a much higher standard than other companies. Apple has to not only beat earnings expectations, but they have to beat them by a 
significant margin or else the market will punish the stock price.  Benjamin Graham said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” This is a 
company that isn’t meant to be traded; it should be a long term investment. The peaks and troughs should be ignored and in the long run, Apple’s true valuation will be priced in. Their second quarter numbers weren’t in line with expectations, but I strongly believe their stock has seen an irrational and unjustified sell off in the past year. On February 23, 2015 Apple shares hit its all-time high of $133/share, which gave them a market cap of $736 billion. They were expected to be the first trillion dollar company. Quarter after quarter they met all expectations, yet the stock continued to fall to where it is today. As of April 28, 2016, Apple is trading at $94.83/share, roughly down 28% February 2015.  The price to earnings ratio is a way of valuing a company based off its share price divided by its earnings per share. If a company has very little earnings compared to its share price, the ratio can be extremely high. Netflix and Amazon for example have both high P/E ratios because they have very little earnings. Investors who buy these high P/E stocks are paying very high multiples. They’re valuing the companies as if they actually made money. Apple on the other hand, is trading at very low multiple and the market has already priced them in for lower future sales. Their current P/E ratio is 10.88, meaning you’re only paying 10 times earnings. You can see from the attached chart that it’s quite cheap compared to its competitors. Alphabet is trading 30.39 times earnings, and Microsoft is trading for 38.82 times earnings. You can say that you’re paying 179% more for Alphabet, and 256% more for Microsoft.

**Revenue Streams**

The main article discussed in this paper suggests that Apple’s innovation and high growth has peaked. Like tech companies of the past have proved, a company can’t stay hot forever. Investors believe that when iPhone sales start slowing, Apple’s valuation will collapse. I will breakdown Apple’s revenue streams and explain why they are more than just a smartphone company. In their second quarter earnings report they showed high revenue growth in their services sector accompanied by their highly valuable ecosystem.

While Apple is known as a hardware company, they are making huge revenues through their services and expanding ecosystem. “Investors may have been focused on the decline in iPhone shipments when Apple reported its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but there was one bright spot which could be a key driver of growth for the U.S. technology giant: Services” (Kharpal, 2016). Their services include products like iTunes, their App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. On the Q2 earnings call, Tim Cook said, “We are very happy with the continued strong growth in revenue from Services, thanks to the incredible strength of the Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over one billion active devices” (Hoover, 2016). Apple’s ecosystem makes all these services much more accessible, which leads to much higher revenues. “Revenue from services came in at $5.99 billion in the fiscal second quarter - a 20 percent rise from the same period last year, highlighting the focus Apple has been putting on the segment” (Kharpal, 2016). While Apple sees higher revenues during iPhone upgrade cycles, their Services give them recurring and growing revenues. There’s a lot of room to grow in some of their newer services, “The current 13 million subscriber number for Apple Music, which chief executive Tim Cook announced yesterday, was small in comparison to the over 1 billion install base of Apple devices” (Kharpal, 2016). 

Apple’s ecosystem is an integral part of the whole user experience when using Apple products.  It’s also a big reason why Apple users would never considering switching to Google’s Android devices. “As the years have rolled on however, it’s clear that Apple’s competitive advantage isn’t built on its hardware or its software. Apple’s greatest competitive advantage is its ecosystem” (Jackson, 2016). Apples ecosystem includes the following: iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, iCloud, Apple TV, App Store, Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Car Play, and the Health Kit. All of these devices are continuously synced together. As an example, you can start an email on your iPad, and finish it on your iPhone. You can download music through iTunes and it will simultaneously be available to listen to across all your devices, including your CarPlay located in your automobile. When someone buys an iPhone, they will most likely purchase more Apple devices inside the ecosystem instead of buying an nonintegrated PC from Microsoft or device from Google. “Apple today trumpeted that gross revenue from its iOS App Store -- which now also includes software for the Apple Watch and Apple TV -- exceeded $20 billion for 2015, implying that sales were up between 40% and 47% year-over-year” (Keizer, 2016). It’s easy to see how valuable Apple’s ecosystem is for both the consumers and their total revenues. 

**Apple’s Next Big Move**

Apple is often criticized for having so much cash, but never making any big acquisitions. I’m bullish on Apple because I like cash rich companies that are patient and extremely careful with their capital budgeting and acquisitions. They have some of the smartest minds in the industry and I suspect they are working on several large projects.  Reports show that Apple has been hiring experts from the automotive industry to begin developing a car. “Apple has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. They said the project, code-named “Titan,” has an initial design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of these people said” (Ramsey, 2015). Why should they make their own car when they could just buy Tesla? Apple might be able to do it cheaper, have full autonomy, and build something that blows Tesla away. Just to put things into perspective, Apple has so much cash they could buy Tesla, Netflix, and Starbucks, all at a 20% premium. Yet, Apple hasn’t been making any big acquisitions. They have made one small acquisition in the past year: a virtual reality startup. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” an Apple spokesperson wrote in an email to VentureBeat” (Novet, 2016). Facebook on the other hand, has been snatching up numerous companies. In 2014 alone, they acquired 56 companies, one of which cost them $19 billion. Apple on the other hand has not announced any big plans, besides the car, and we must assume they are planning something big. It’s possible that Apple knows they don’t need to acquire anything; they have the most valuable company in the world and boast a 40% profit margin. 

I think within the next five years Apple’s market share will dominate all world economies at a far greater scale. I believe they will consume the entire smartphone market share, and their ecosystem will aid in higher revenues and increased customer retention. I think their valuation will shoot well past one trillion dollars after they make one of the largest acquisitions in world history. I can speculate, and see Apple buying a company like Visa, one of the world’s largest multination financial services company. 

Apple has grown from a hardware and software company into a luxury brand with the highest of customer loyalty. They are cash rich, well disciplined, provide a high ROE, and are currently trading 28% below its 52 week highs. As Benjamin Graham said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” Apple has been beaten up in the past year due to macroeconomic factors, but has proven they can still churn out 200B in annual revenue in a bad year. Apple is only trading at 10x earnings, they are months away from the iPhone 7 upgrade cycle, and I rate Apple (AAPL) as a strong buy.

# Description
The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (Boston Beer) is a craft brewer in the United States. Brands include Samuel Adams, Twisted Tea and Angry Orchard. The Company’s beers are primarily positioned in the Better Beer category of the beer industry, which includes craft (small, independent and traditional) brewers, domestic specialty beers and most imports. Better Beers are determined by higher price, quality, image and taste, as compared with regular domestic beers.

Sales and profitability have had a nice trajectory over the last 5 years.

## Recent financials 
|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $1,024m | $966m | $794m | $629m | $558m|
|EPS | $7.25 | $6.69 | $5.18 | $4.39 | $4.81|

That is despite a tough *beer* market, as the outline in their latest SEC filing

&gt; The domestic beer industry, excluding Better Beers, has experienced a decline in shipment volume over the last ten years. The Company believes that this decline is due to declining alcohol consumption per person in the population, drinkers trading up to drink high quality, more flavorful beers and increased competition from wine and spirits companies.

## Competition

Competition is intense, again from the filing

&gt; The Better Beer category within the United States beer market is highly competitive due to the increasing number of craft brewers, imported beers with similar pricing and target drinkers, and efforts by large domestic brewers to enter this category. The Company estimates there are over 5,000 craft breweries in operation or in the planning stages, up from approximately 1,409 operating craft breweries in 2006. 

Though if we look at the financials both the operating profit and returns are inline with the big brewers, though brewers are less profitable that wine &amp; spirit companies.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Boston Beer Co Inc | $949M | 20% | 20%
Anheuser Busch Inbev SA (ADR) | $42,551M | 38% | 18%
Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A. (ADR) | $2,177M | 19% | 11%
Craft Brew Alliance Inc | $202M | 5% | 0%
Heineken N.V. (ADR) | $22,765M | 21% | 15%
Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (ADR) | $21,375M | 11% | -ve
Molson Coors Brewing Company | $3,525M | 22% | 5%
Brown-Forman Corporation | $3,091M | 36% | 62%
Constellation Brands, Inc. | $6,789M | 33% | 18%
Diageo plc (ADR) | $13,600M | 33% | 32%

Boston Beer Co Inc has $50M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 2% of the market value of Boston Beer Co Inc. So nothing to worry about on the balance sheet, as far as I can tell.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $156.00 for Boston Beer Co Inc and their recommendation to clients is *Hold*. That implies a downside of -8% to their target. It seems that he high valuation at 25x forecast earnings and is weighing on Wall Street :( or it could be that earnings this year are forecast to be down v. 2015.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. Valuation doesn't look as stretched as at $BREW but it is still strange to see a valuation in the 20s for a business that isn't expected to grow much. Though admittedly the entire sector looks richly valued, distillers and wine included.

DEO | $70,280M | 17x | 4% | 3% | 8%

# Dividends

Boston Beer Co Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. And sadly:

&gt; Since its inception, the Company has not paid dividends and does not currently anticipate paying dividends on its Class A or Class B Common Stock in the foreseeable future. 

The company prefers to do stock repurchases instead. Theoretically the same  as dividends of course!

&gt; On February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company increased the aggregate expenditure limit for the Company’s Stock Repurchase Program by $50.0 million, thereby increasing the limit from $525.0 million to $575.0 million. As of December 26, 2015, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of approximately 11.5 million shares of its Class A Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $446.1 million.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -14%. That's against a backdrop of sales down 5% in the last 3 months.

Yes competition is up, but they have a great distribution network, have invested heavily in the last 3 years, which is now starting to pay off, and they are launching new products that could see growth pick up. 

Maybe it's not frothy at these levels? Even if Wall Street isn't a fan.

# Description
Mohawk Industries, Inc. is a flooring manufacturer that creates products for residential and commercial spaces around the world. The Company's manufacturing and distribution processes provide carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, wood, stone, luxury vinyl tile (LVT) and vinyl flooring. Its trademarks include American Olean, Bigelow, Lees, Quick-Step and Unilin.

## Recent financials 

From their latest annual

&gt; These markets are influenced by many factors including consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy. 

So sounds like this is a classic cyclical business with the economy being the key driver. The growth and margin expansion look pretty good too!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $8.1bn | $7.8bn | $7.3bn | $5.8bn | $5.6bn|
|EPS | $8.31 | $7.25 | $5.07 | $3.61 | $2.52|
## Competition

From their latest SEC filing

&gt; The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals. In 2014, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $21.8 billion in sales, up approximately 5.6% over 2013's sales of $20.7 billion.

&gt; The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines.

Despite that commentary both margins and returns look healthy.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Mohawk Industries, Inc. | $8,362M | 18% | 16%
Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. | $782M | 13% | 14%

Select Comfort Corp. | $1,217M | 8% | 15%
Tempur Sealy International Inc | $3,133M | 12% | 40%

Mohawk Industries, Inc. has $3,151M of net debt. That is 2.1x it's latest operating profit.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $226.75 for Mohawk Industries, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 20% to their target.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. The valuation is aggressive versus it's *Household Furnishings* peers. Though, I'm not sure I have the right peer group. If we look at a wider cyclical consumer group forecast PE is over 20 times with long-term growth expectations of 15%+ per annum. Could it be this is a ""boring business"" that is largely ignored?

SCSS.O | $1,010M | 17x | 11% | 0% | 8%
TPX | $3,349M | 14x | 22% | 0% | 5%

# Dividends
Mohawk Industries, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. The firm appears to be happily doing deals, re-investing cashflow rather than paying dividends. In 2015 they did 3 big deals. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 0% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 2%. That's against a backdrop of revenues up 15% to $2.17B over the 3 months and reported net income up from $22.3M to $171.5M. Revenues were up for all 3 divisions: Flooring ROW; Flooring NA  and Ceramics.

In their [latest earnings call](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3972500-mohawk-industries-mhk-jeffrey-s-lorberbaum-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) they talked about their optimism, the benefits of the acquistions and the way their recent capital investments are bearing fruit. 

But they note that:

&gt; Each of our capital expansion projects creates significant long-term value, adding new revenues by increasing our product offerings and our customer base. Typically, these projects take one to three years to achieve their full benefit. All of these investments could provide higher returns than our acquisitions, though start-up costs impact our immediate results.

Perhaps these investments will provide a catalyst for earnings upgrades in the coming quarters? Alternatively could it be a stronger US economy and housebuilding market?

&gt; Similar to 2015, the U.S. economy had a soft start this year, but continues to benefit from solid job creation and low interest rates. Despite sluggish new home starts in March, the National Association of Home Builders affirmed the recovery of the U.S. single home family market.

For me, this is an intriguing stock! I think it merits a more detailed look.

I don't think there is anything but positives to come of this. Both for the credit rating industry and for Morningstar. This caught my eye:

&gt; But in addition to bringing more competition, Morningstar believes it will introduce proprietary data in its ratings methodology. In its release, Morningstar said it is “the only credit ratings agency analyzing sustainable competitive advantages, which we refer to as ‘economic moats.’” That refers to a measure of how likely a company is to keep competitors at bay for an extended period."

32,2016-08-07,Ethan2105,0,An idea about jobless claims trends and an upcoming recession,"After getting slightly saved from my gold bagholding during last week's jobless claims report I decided to look into the history of these reports. The website I used to look at the data chart is this: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/jobless-claims Looking at the chart I decided to figure out the trends, the mean values, the average length between spikes, the causes of the spikes, etc. What I found is that the average time period between spikes in these claims is ~8 years. Also they clearly happen due to an economic crisis here in the US or in the rest of the world. Looking at the max chart of the data the 1971 spike was due to the 1970's energy crisis, the one in the mid 1970's was due to the secondary banking crisis in the UK (this links to what is happening in UK right now btw), the early 1980's spike was due to the early 80's recession, early 90's due to the recession then, same with the dot com bubble and the most recent financial crisis of 2007-2008. From this it is clear that we are clearly due for a recession and a spike in these claims. The average being 8 years we are at this point. Also looking at the variance averages in these numbers it is seen that the low average is around 250,000 and the average high is around 430,000. Ever since 2008 which topped at around 650,000 these claims have been on a steady decrease. At one point they reached the 250,000 level but are now starting to rise again. Personally I feel that the main companies are trying to say this isn't a big deal to help their investments, but in reality I feel it is the start of something big. With the European economy sitting on a time bomb, China weakening, and the US in a deadlock between saving consumers or banks with the rates, to me the economy is on the tip of a huge recession. This week's jobless claims report will show low to mid 270k. The news will say that it isn't a big deal until it reaches 300k, but slowly those numbers will continue to rise. 280k by September is nearly guaranteed and there is nothing the US can do to change this. I know you are going to tell me that I am crazy and I know that the news and fed will continue to hide this issue with random fluff, but trust me a recession is imminent in the near future. If not this coming year, in the next 3 is guaranteed. To sum it up a clear trend is showing that a downtrend in the performance of the economy is historically bound to happen, and current events provide obvious evidence to back this claim up. I highly recommend establishing a position in gold while it is this cheap, or you can establish long term puts on spy that terminate in a year or two. Lmk what you all think."

# Description
Carnival is a cruise company and provides vacations to cruise destinations throughout the world. 

## Recent financials 

Looking at their financials I am immediately annoyed by the presence of ""Adjusted EPS"", which unsurprisingly has been higher than EPS for each of the last 5 years. Also, it's remarkable how big the capex is every year, Over $2bn. Wow. That's a lotta boat. Other items that stand out are their need to highlight lots of FX rates, the price of oil, and the efficiency of their oil usage. Though am glad to see that passenger numbers continue to grow!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Passengers | 10.8m | 10.6m | 10.1m | 9.8m | 9.6m|
|Revenue | $15.7bn | $15.8bn | $15.5bn | $15.4bn | $15.8bn|
|EPS | $2.26 | $1.56 | $1.36 | $1.65 | $2.42|

## Competition
From their filings:

&gt; We compete with land-based vacation alternatives throughout the world, such as hotels, resorts (including all-inclusive resorts), theme parks, organized tours, casinos, vacation ownership properties, and other internet-based alternative lodging sites. Our principal cruise competitors are Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and MSC Cruises. Almost 90% of all 2014 global cruise guests sailed with these competitors and us.

And from an industry dynamic
&gt; The 2015 annual penetration rates when computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population are as follows: 4.0% for Australia and New Zealand, 3.4% for North America, 2.7% for the United Kingdom (“UK”) and 1.9% for continental Europe. Cruising in China is in the early stages of development. 

So it's a really consolidated sector with just 3 big players. Plus there's still rather a low penetration rate for the industry. And given aging populations, and the potential to say cruises are safer, maybe there are some pretty helpful dynamics here for CCL and it's peers.

Though, I fear that this is a rather capital intensive business. Whereas hotels can have franchises or lease the property, you sort of have to have a boat? Is that why the returns on equity are low compared to the hotel majors?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Carnival Corp | $15,950M | 29% | 10%
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd | $8,401M | 26% | 9%
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd | $4,484M | 27% | 14%

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc | $11,552M | 23% | 29%

Wyndham Worldwide Corporation | $5,582M | 22% | 63%
InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (ADR) | $1,803M | 43% | N/A

## Cash / Debt?
Carnival Corp has $8,910M of net debt. That is 1.9x it's latest operating profit. Not worrisome, and given the capital they have in terms of boats, I suppose it makes sense to load the business with debt! Though perhaps that wasn't a great strategy during a recession? 

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $57.00 for Carnival Corp and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 22% to their target.

# Valuation

The Cruise sector is clearly cheaper than the major hotels. Dramatically so. Though on a free cashflow basis Some of the hotels do manage to generate a similar amount of cash.

# Dividends
Carnival Corp is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.29 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.25 per share. That is a 3% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.29 compares to a forecast EPS of $3.33.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -2%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 3% in the first 6 months, with reasonable demand. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ccl/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.
&gt; (Signs for) the remainder of the year are very strong for our brands enabling us to raise our revenue yield expectations and affirming our conviction to deliver over 20% earnings growth this year.

Though they do go on to say that their ""return on capital"" is just 9% though they hope to get it to double digits. And they expressed confidence in their financial position which allowed them authorise a new share buyback.

Sure the geopolitical uncertainty isn't good for the travel industry, but aren't cruise ships pottering round the Caribbean insulated from that? Yes Brexit is bad with £ earnings now worth less in $. Though on the other hand, surely there is a great opportunity for secular growth in China and the rest of Asia?

At 14x earnings, it's not ridiculous a valuation, is it? Even if FX is a headwind. Though a 9% Return on Capital is the counter balance?

So...party time?

# Description

Disney remarkably diversified as an entertainment company. The Company's business segments include Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Studio Entertainment, Consumer Products and their Interactive. They own a chunk of hulu and their branding is ever present. 

## Recent financials 

From $30 to $100 in 5 years, you can see why with the revenues, earnings and dividends!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $52bn | $49bn | $45bn | $42bn | $41bn|
|EPS | $4.90 | $4.26 | $3.38 | $3.13 | $2.52|
|Dividend | $1.81 | $0.86 | $0.75 | $0.60 | $0.40|

But where's the growth come from? 

* In the last 2 years, revenues are up by $7bn, $3bn came from ""Media Networks"", $2bn from ""Resorts"", $1bn from ""Studios"" and $1bn from ""Products"". 
* Operating profit grew by just under $4bn with Media / Resort &amp; Studios adding a $1bn each, Products and Interactive adding the rest.
* Though note: Media is $23bn on the $52bn sales. And it is $8bn of the $15bn operating profit.
* If you are curious what the Media Networks business is, well, ESPN, the Disney Channels and ABC, really.

So the Media business is the powerhouse, but the profits come through in each division. And to some extent, I feel that Disney's different divisions re-enforce each other. 

## Competition

There is so much competition in this market, on every front for a parent or consumers $$$. So it's remarkable to see the longevity of the Disney franchises, the high margins and good returns. 

Now don't be fooled thinking this is a capital light business. Sure it doesn't have cables in the ground, but it does own resorts and other infrastructure. There's over $25bn of fixed assets!

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Walt Disney Co | $56,002M | 31% | 20%
Comcast Corporation | $75,973M | 33% | 15%
Time Warner Inc | $27,903M | 28% | 17%
Twenty-First Century Fox Inc | $27,326M | 23% | 18%
DISH Network Corp | $15,137M | 17% | 28%
CBS Corporation | $14,303M | 23% | 28%
Viacom, Inc. | $13,050M | 27% | 59%

## Cash / Debt?

DIS has $15,214M of net debt. That is 0.9x it's latest operating profit. So all's fine there. Doing deals, buying amazing franchises like Star Wars etc, is possible with that sort of leverage.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $108.63 for Walt Disney Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 16% to their target.

# Valuation

It looks like it's better value that Comcast and not too far off Time Warner or Fox. The clear ""cheap"" play is Viacom, but the management fight and long-term outlook make that look like a value trap.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/dis/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

CBS | $22,279M | 12x | 17% | 1% | 9%
VIAB.O | $14,424M | 10x | -3% | 4% | 21%

# Dividends

Walt Disney Co forecast dividend of $1.41 compares to a forecast EPS of $5.79. So there would be room for a boost. Though they appear to prefer buybacks!

&gt;  The net use of cash in the current year included $6.1 billion of common stock repurchases and $3.1 billion in dividends

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -2% that compares with no change in the earnings forecasts. On a 6 month view the stocks off 6% with earnings forecasts shaved by 1%.

With the year end being Sept, perhaps the stocks in flux ahead of full year results?

Though on the management team's July call with Wall Street brokers they reminded everyone that 

&gt; that in our slate in fiscal 2017 is another Star Wars movie and a Cars movie. And Cars, before Frozen, was the number one Consumer Products franchise at the company. Not as big as Star Wars, but really significant. So – and we also have Spiderman being released by Sony but being made by us, as well as Thor in calendar 2017.

Given they've got the ""machine"" well oiled, will 2017 not be another bumper year?

35,2016-09-21,TheYamazaki,8,Show r/investing: Google Sheets Portfolio Tracker,"Hey r/investing!    

I dabble in investing and am trying to get more serious.  The Rule Breaker Investing podcast made me realize I need to track my performance and “keep score”.  My broker does a good job of showing me the “current state” of my positions, but historical performance gets lost.    

So, I started using Google Spreadsheets to create a basic portfolio tracker.  The sheet automatically retrieves price data for my holdings, then creates a historical chart of my portfolio value, like [this chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/176OttKoJWXlbpv97V50GwUDWlHRLIOIkmv0TIxWc3cc/pubchart?oid=1910859930&amp;format=image).    

I’m working on improvements to automatically update and email the latest chart to myself every Saturday morning.    

I also have other ideas.  For example, I’m a big fan of [Magic Formula investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_formula_investing) and want to automate that trading strategy for myself.    

Has anyone done anything like this before?  
Anyone else interested in building/using something like this?    

Happy Investing!  

Edit: Someone asked if the total portfolio value is static - it's not, I was just showing a very short time period.  I've updated the dates to show the total value changing over time, in case that wasn't clear.  "
36,2016-09-20,jatjqtjat,1,Thoughts on Spin-offs in general and the up coming AdvanSix spin off from Honeywell,"Prefix: I'm currently reading ""you can be a stock market genius"" by Joel Greenblatt.  Before you judge the title, It actually a pretty reasonable book. Its fairly highly recommended in the side bar post, and reviews tend to stay ignore the dumb title.  One of the points he makes is that spin offs in general out perform the market.  The reasoning is institutional inventors like to buy large companies usually in the SP 500 or 1000.  So when a spin off happens there is huge sell off.  ""Indiscriminate selling"" is a big thing in the book.  Its what you want to seek out and find because it means you can get stocks for bargain prices.  He claims spin offs on average over time, out perform the SP 500 for 10%.  So SP historically returns around 10%, spin offs return around 20% (of course results on individual spin offs or over short time periods results may vary)

So in 12 days on Oct 2nd.  AdvanSix will spin off from Honeywell

* AdvanSix is a leading producer of Nylon-6, Caprolactam, and some other chemicals that are either needed for Nylon-6 or byproducts of the production process.
* Increased production from China is a big challenge for them.
* SP hasn't yet announced if they will be included in the Sp 500 index.
* Sales have declined in the last 18 months, but they admit it is a cyclical business.
* PE ratio for [chemical manufacturing](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html) is between 25 and 28 currently.
* 2015 earnings look to be just 68 million (from a billion in sales). 
* there will be about 31 million Shares (780 honeywell shares divided by 25).  So with a PE of 25, I'd expect a share price of $54.
* [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673985/000093041316007091/c84951_ex99-1.htm) is their form 10.  Obviously double check my numbers before you make any decision with your own money.

I'm interested in watching the share price after the spin off.  It is trades at a competitive PE, I think i'll be going in with maybe 10% or so of my money.

One thing I see on the form 10, is that is looks like only about 15% of the CEO's compensation will be in the form of stocks, and will initially own no shares.  Greenblatt is big on watching what insiders are doing, and would probably like to she the CEO try to grab a bigger share of the company.  That combined with the fact that this is my first spinoff i'm watching might lead me to just watch on this one.

38,2016-10-23,PuddingwithRum,8,Advice for an investment in the field of IoT,"*I obviously invested myself, which is one reason I'm sharing this with you.*

I know that people tend to stop reading if ""Bitcoin"" is mentioned, this case however is different. 

As the term ""Internet of things"" comes up more and more, the tech behind it is developing fast. 

The following post aims for investors as well as developers to become a part of an interesting project. 

-&gt; IOTA. 

IOTA is an evoluted Blockchain-technology, like Bitcoin but more sophisticated. 

Crypto-currencies differ in subject to their field of action. Some are made for security- and anonymity-reasons, some are made as data carrier. 

While Bitcoin, as the most prominent one, aims to replace currencies, IOTA is made for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).

Iota's focus lies in the interconnectedness of devices to enable micropayment in short timeframes or: “to be the backbone of the IoT”

Why the name IOTA? It refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet which is often used as “a slightest amount”. Furthermore the obvious similarity to IoT, hence the nomenclature. 

It operates on the Tangle, an evoluted Blockchain which has countless strong distinctions from a Blockchain to fit perfectly for the IoT. 

The biggest difference lies in the taxation of transactions, which is at 0.0001 BTC for Bitcoin transactions, but completely free for an IOTA- transaction. 

There are no blocks within the Tangle, and mining is not possible.

This disparity is of big importance in the world of Internet of Things as fees would handicap the transaction-environment of billions of devices. 

Further reading including a technical comparison between the Bitcoin Blockchain and the Tangle can be found here: https://medium.com/iotatangle

The scientific technical description of the Tangle can be read here:	 https://www.iotatoken.com/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf

**To draw a conclusion:** For the first time ever, through IOTA people can transfer money without any fees. This means that even infinitesimally small nano-payments can be made through IOTA - worldwide.

IOTA is the missing puzzle piece for the Machine Economy to fully emerge and reach its desired potential. We (The devs. I'm not a dev) envision IOTA to be the public, permission-less backbone for the Internet of Things that enables true interoperability between all devices. 

A revolutionary, innovative solution for a Billion Dollar market. 

Important info for investors: IOTA is no pump&amp;dump-scheme, therefor it's right now, not possible to invest in it through exchanges, even though it's already 1 year in development. 
Exchanges will be green-lighted in a few weeks. Enough time to read about it. However, investing is possible through OTC-trading in the #trading - channel in slack. 


Feel free to ask, I'll try to answer everything.

# Description
Blackstone is a global alternative asset manager. The Company's alternative asset management businesses include investment vehicles focused on private equity, real estate, hedge fund solutions, non-investment grade credit, secondary funds and other multi-asset class strategies. 

Though it's key to remember that an investment in Blackstone is an investment in ""common units representing limited partner interests"" and overall BX has got a rather [complicated structure](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1393818/000119312516481948/g129194g33d21.jpg).

## Recent financials 

Private equity businesses have **lumpy** revenues to say the least! They have annual management fees like a traditional asset manager based on a % of assets but the real deal in the performance fee.

So what I'm really happy to see is assets continuing to grow and the dividend ticking up.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Assets under management | $336bn | $290bn | $266bn | $210bn | $166bn|
|Revenue | $4.6bn | $7.5bn | $6.6bn | $4.0bn | $3.3bn|
|EPS | $1.04 | $2.58 | $1.98 | $0.41 | -$0.35|
|DPS | $2.90 | $1.92 | $1.18 | $0.52 | $0.62|

## Competition

Competition comes in many guises. From other asset managers for private equity expertise and from asset managers in other asset classes. 

Have to admit, I am at a loss on how to compare these folks operationally, so here's their revenue and returns. Suggestions?

|Companies|Latest Sales|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|
Blackstone Group LP | $3,034M |  5%
KKR &amp; Co. L.P. | $1,236M |  -ve
Oaktree Capital Group LLC | $637M | 13%
The Carlyle Group LP | $2,104M |  -ve
Apollo Global Management LLC | $1,168M |  25%
Fortress Investment Group LLC | $1,143M |  3%
BlackRock, Inc. | $11,128M | N/A
Franklin Resources, Inc. | $6,880M  | 13%
T. Rowe Price Group Inc | $4,140M  | 21%

Similarly it seems a little odd to think about the balance sheet and debt levels.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $31.46 for Blackstone Group LP and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 33% to their target.

Which if achievable seems like a juicy return, for backing some of the smartest folks on Wall Street.

# Valuation

On earnings it's as cheap as a *boring* traditional asset manager like BEN. Though given the volatility of earnings, let's look at the yield... 7%. Nice. 

Though again given the volatility of earnings, there's not reason to believe it can't get cut in tough times. For example the forecast for this year is a fraction of last years $2.90 payout.

TROW.O | $16,208M | 15x | 8% | 3% | 

# Dividends

Blackstone Group LP is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.61 per share, compares to a forecast EPS of $1.90.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -9% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -8%. 

Now the backdrop is ugly, but again this is the nature of the industry. Revenues were down 40% and EPS down 50% in the last 6 months. Ooof. 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they pointed to continued growth in asset but a challenging global environment. Fortunately 75% of the business is US based. The CEO also decided to come up with a weird formula to value BX!

&gt; For our unitholders, if you simply ignore realizations and focus solely on our fee-related earnings, we have a clear line of sight towards strong double-digit growth in fee earnings for next year. This alone could generate approximately $1 per unit or more depending upon the timing of certain events, particularly funds being launched. You should know, which I actually didn't, that the S&amp;P is yielding around 2% today. It's incredibly low. And we don't see why our mostly locked up fee earnings shouldn't be capitalized in our stock price at a similar, if not, lower yield to the S&amp;P. You could do the math. A 2% yield, the same as the S&amp;P on $1 off fee-related earnings implies a $50 stock price, not to $26 where we are today. I know this seems hard to believe but it happens to be mathematically true and finance is supposed to have something to do with mathematics.

I chuckled when I see Steve Schwarzman say he doesn't know the dividend yield of the S&amp;P! Though I absolute hate when management talks about their share price.

My prejudice aside, it's hard not to admire the growth in assets, the machiavellian style of these ex-bankers, and the cash potential of BX. Just think, the stock's price is $24 and in the last 9 years they've paid a total of $11 in dividends. And they do buybacks too.

So even if the way they make money is a ""black box"", and it's crazy volatile...may be just may be...

What's more interesting is its corporate structure! In July 2013, Softbank, the largest tech business in Japan, took control of Sprint. Today they own 83% of the stock. Softbank's the co-owner of Yahoo! Japan with Yahoo! and along side... Yahoo! they own a big chunk of Alibaba. Makes you wonder why Sprint wasn't used as a vehicle to buy Yahoo! doesn't it?

## Recent financials 

It's not a pretty picture. Sales down and losing money. If you look into the details, their capex is higher than their operational profit. So for now, they are in investment mode. But how long with that last?

|March-end|2016A|2015A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $32bn | $35bn | 
|Operating +/- | $0.3bn | -$1.9bn | 
|Net loss | -$2.0bn | -$3.3bn |

aside: I've only got 2 years, since they changed the year end to March.

## Competition

They describe the usual suspects, if you read the annual report

&gt; We believe that the market for wireless services has been and will continue to be characterized by competition on the basis of price, the types of services and devices offered and quality of service. We compete with a number of wireless carriers, including three other national wireless companies: AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile.

They go on to bemoan the maturity of the market, the lack of growth and the high subsidies competitors give for phones. There is surprisingly little mention of new technologies undermining the entire business model.

If we compare their metrics, last 12 months, it's in the same boat as T-Mobile. Perhaps the old fixed telephone business of AT&amp;T and Verizon are still huge cash flow machines. Oh to be a quasi-monopoly.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Sprint Corp | $32,165M | 26% | -ve
Verizon Communications Inc. | $130,115M | 35% | 94%
T-Mobile Us Inc | $33,917M | 24% | 6%
AT&amp;T Inc. | $162,265M | 33% | 14%
Centurylink Inc | $17,829M | 38% | 7%
Level 3 Communications, Inc. | $8,222M | 32% | 42%
Charter Communications Inc | $13,653M | 38% | 14%

## Cash / Debt?

Sprint Corp has $31,873M of net debt. That is 3.9x it's latest operating profit, rather high, though as a telecom operator, it's not a major worry. Though remember $T is on 2.3x and $VZ on 2.1x. 

# Dividends
With debts like that, it's no surprise that Sprint Corp is not forecast to pay a dividend this year.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $4.69 for Sprint Corp and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies a downside of 30% to their target.

# Valuation

And then it comes to the metrics. Sure there is a reasonable free cashflow yield but there is no dividend and no earnings this year. 

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/s/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
S | $26,502M | -ve | 5% | 0% | 10%
VZ | $204,916M | 13x | 4% | 5% | 20%
TMUS.O | $37,900M | 35x | 20% | 0% | 18%
T | $240,912M | 14x | 8% | 5% | 22%
CTL | $14,758M | 11x | 0% | 8% | 21%
LVLT.K | $16,402M | 27x | 10% | 0% | 29%
CHTR.O | $72,359M | 75x | 31% | 0% | 17%

So how on earth do you value it? Earnings for the year to March 2017 are expected to be a loss of 16c a shares, having lost 42c a share in year to March 2016. Jump forward a year and it's forecast to be break even. 

I'm lost... do I flip to ""Price to Book Value"" or ""Price to Sales"" as a metric? And assume they'll get back to profit in a few years and the discounts will close? 

Or imagine I'm patient and I'm willing to wait 5 years. Say I want 10% return a year for my patience. Means I'd expect the stock to hit $11. If it's trading on a pedestrian 15x at the time the earnings would need to be 70 cents a share. i.e. just under $3bn of earnings. Okay, it's not impossible, but I can't say I'm confident.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 47% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -24%. In the background, sales fell 1% in the quarter, and the reported losses widened.

But up 47%. Go figure!

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, there was a lot of talk about trying to maintain revenues, cut costs and aim for cash flow breakeven this year. But it was hard to identify any good news. Just a lack of bad news. Which of course is good ;)

So is it a good investment? I just can't tell. Seems like a pretty speculative investment to me. Sorry.

43,2016-10-05,jatjqtjat,6,Does this bug anyone else? - (Chart axis not starting at 0),"http://imgur.com/a/g55wo

The image explains what I mean.

I just created some fake data to show an example of what i mean.  Changes to any stock's price look dramatic when you start your axis close to the lowest value of the stock.  But if you start the axis at zero, it often becomes apparent that the change in price is minor.  I've made a habit of mentally accounting for it, but it really bothers me that most every website shows what feels like a very distorted view of such simple data.

**Edit**: to some of the people defending the adjusted axis, I think there are pros and cons that nobody is really disputing

Starting at 0

* Con: Detail is harder to see, and sometimes impossible to see
* Pro: Price change relative to total price is easier to see.

Starting at a value near the low point of the stock

* Pro: detail is easier to see.
* Con: detail is easier to see because it is exaggerated.  So the viewer must mentally compensate for this exaggeration.
* Pro: Price change relative to total price can still be worked out by looking at the axis, and doing some basic math.
* Con: at first glance, price changes are exaggerated.  (But of course, by paying attention to the axis, the viewer can mentally account for this).

With that in mind, I would argue that most people (although certainly not experienced traders) would benefit more from being able to see relative price changes without needing to do any math, than they would be from being able to clearly see minor details.

I'm surprised on /r/investing, where presumably most people aren't day trading, that people so strongly favor seeing the detail over the big picture.

alternative,  you can start the axis wherever you want if instead of showing me the stock price you assume I invested 1 dollar at the start of the time period and show me the value of my investment.  That would allow you to see detail and percent change easier."

# Description
Johnson &amp; Johnson primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. The Company's segments include Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. 

* The Consumer segment includes a range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin care, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women's health and wound care markets. 
* The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on over five therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. 
* The Medical Devices segment includes a range of products used in the orthopedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields.

But with 3 divisions, which do you have to watch?

|In 2015|Sales|Profit (pre-tax)|Margin|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Consumer | $14bn | $2bn | 13%|
|Pharma | $31bn | $12bn | 37% |
|Devices | $25bn | $7bn | 27% |

Looks like them baby wipes and shampoo bottles can be largely ignored!

## Recent financials 

Perhaps the funniest thing in the annual is that JNJ doesn't stop with 5 years of financials but gives 11 years! And wow are they an amazing 11 years, in terms of growth and cashflow. Even through the ""great recession""!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $70bn | $74bn | $71bn | $67bn | $65bn|
|EPS | $5.48 | $5.70 | $4.81 | $3.86 | $3.49|

And within the data, there is the remarkable R&amp;D spend figure of $9bn a year. 

## Competition

Let's ignore the Consumer business and focus on the big names in Pharma and Devices. Overall, JNJ's margin doesn't look best in class, but that's the Consumer business ""dragging"" down the figures. It's Pharma unit's 37% margin is respectable and the Devices' 27% is more than just respectable. Overall, the high return, stands out. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Johnson &amp; Johnson | $70,877M | 33% | 21%
Pharma |  |  | 
Pfizer Inc. | $52,286M | 38% | 11%
Merck &amp; Co., Inc. | $39,444M | 37% | 11%

Becton Dickinson and Co | $12,311M | 23% | 15%
Boston Scientific Corporation | $7,956M | 24% | -5%

## Cash / Debt?

And for such a large business, it's remarkable to see Johnson &amp; Johnson has $16,341M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 5% of the market value of Johnson &amp; Johnson. What they doing to do with all that cash, I wonder?

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $126.61 for Johnson &amp; Johnson and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 7% to their target.

# Valuation

So the upside, isn't great. Treating it as a pharma stock, you'd think JNJ's pricey. As a Devices business, it's cheap. Versus a Procter and Gamble it's remarkably cheap!

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/jnj/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

# Dividends

Johnson &amp; Johnson is forecast to pay a dividend of $3.13 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $3.05 per share. That is a 3% growth. The forecast dividend of $3.13 compares to a forecast EPS of $6.69.

And on-top of the near 50% payout ratio, they are busy buying back stock.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -3% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 1%. In the 6 months to June, sales were up 2%. Earnings off 4%. 

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers in July, the Chairman / CEO made a really detailed statement about the vision of the business: the value of having 3 business lines, the above market growth, the strategic deals, improving markets, heavily investing in R&amp;D.

Taking it at face-value, I'd be drinking from the Kool-Aid. But the historic financials back it up nicely.

So, maybe this is one of them dependable, quality stocks. In fact perhaps its 3 great stocks in one?

Any objections?

45,2016-11-30,Earlstoddard,0,"Investor(s); Thoughts to Ponder when working with the next FB, MS, APPLE, SpaceX (BIG IDEA).","Investors looking for that Hole In One Idea... This is a little long, but I guarantee a great read for you.

Many of these posts are about, where do I put my money? How do I conduct my due diligence? Are there any APPLES, Microsoft's, Facebooks, or has everything been invented. 

The answer to this is, we are really on the cusp of some technological leaps that are going to put these last advances to shame. 

Most technology that has been invented has been quite DUMB...Great at collecting, saving, retrieving, collaborating, etc... Still, though, creating silos of information that just sits on little islands waiting to be handled. 

Here we are now at the edge of something new called ""Machine Learning."" The ability to exponentially grab millions of lines of data, mathematically process it (algorithms), the provide a result that will guide person, machine, application... anything at the ""Speed of Live."" 

There are areas today that are earning investors significant returns into the future. Let's name a few... Uber, Travel Web Sites, Autonomous Cars, SpaceX, Tesla, Stock Market Analysis Engines ( Maybe on the edge of ethically illegal), you get me drift here. Things that process millions of lines of information in milliseconds giving a result that would have taken hours, weeks or months before. Let alone systems out of Darpa and MIT for Defense programs. Scary! 

But yes, all of which require investors. Smart, savvy investors that understand that to bake a loaf of bread needs time for the yeast to raise, and great bread, must be knocked back down several times over before it then must spend time in the oven before it goes to market. 

These investors are not those that are going to watch gains and losses daily but be about exploration of the unknown. Believe in a principle and participate to the point to where they do not hinder or stop the progress of innovation. 

Innovation and Investment go hand in hand. Many investors I meet that get involved in innovation say, well let the customer pay up front? Sell it first! These I believe will be the wrong investor. These investors need to be investments making widgets, which then drop the returns down to less than the stock market. 

Let's look at Elon Musk who must have sounded crazy when he went into launching spacecraft. He was quoted as saying, he was unsure if he could even get a rocket into space safely. He knew by his education, innovative, creative drive and his passion he could take a few investors on a ride of their life. Today, his company, not without risk, is creating huge competition against the Boeing, Lockheed, and others. Creating Competition that is driving our space programs in the US towards goals much faster than NASA alone could. This is called capitalism at its best. Some of these early investors are going to make incredible amounts of money with Elon Musk. 

Here are other tips...I have found in my experience with dealing with these investment deals myself. 

The typical, let's look at your portfolio, customers, etc... are not always appropriate in what I call ""Exponential Opportunities,"" these are opportunities yielding 30:1 ratios across 3 to 5 years. Allow the company you are investing in, the small investment to express themselves in a small scale version of their end product. 

You are saying WHAT? Yes, rather than saying SHOW ME NOW, YES OR NO...cultivate and peel back the onion on the artist, the technologist, the futurist that sits in front of you. 

This is where it get's crazy...which innovation is not a science, it has so many unknowns on how it is derived and gifted to those that have it. Spend a little money. Not on Due-Diligence, or testing of financials, but the testing of the idea. Give the innovator the tools to animate the concept in a media that can be understood by all. Then you will then, only then, start to see the potential of the technology behind it. 

I am sure that Elon Musk did not build a rocket first in the desert and keep firing it off. He proved it in principle, through modeling and animation. He showed the possibility, and at the same time he was showing his development team through that investment what had been parked in the back of his mind for so long. 

What is humorous about this, is every investor wants an Elon Musk in their portfolio. But they do not know how to work with the wild world of technological innovation on a big scale. 

What is funny, is that it is almost proven that innovators are dot connectors. They see the end picture; the see the raw physics behind their invention. This does not translate well in columns and rows. 

The key in all of this, to put this into columns and rows, is what is the need for this technology. Can the technology not just be an island in itself but drive the old technologies. 

For instance. Let's go back to Elon. He has figured out a more efficient way to build rockets, launch them, retrieve them to fuel programs already on the books. 

Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Administrative Assistants, Teaching Assistants, Manufacturing Assistants (Robotics), etc... are all about vision, possibilities, innovation that can't be captured in your accountant's ledger. Not until you see the scaled model work, and a small team understands where it fits into the puzzle of the markets. 

If you are an investor, do you want 5% returns (Zero Risk), 8% - 12% returns (Stocks), or are you ready to allow your money cultivate innovation with the right gifted mind or company with the next big thing! 

I have theories on how to work with innovators, and that if companies are creating new Exponential Growth products, you need not salesmen, but investment managers and department to manage the lifecycle, inflows, and outflows of technological portfolios. 

I have a passion for companies that have holistic growth from an idea to a market-wide product. These are not anomalies; these are processes that when controlled and worked with can be very predictable and controlled. 

I am hoping this grows into a conversation that can inspire and give foresight into the scary world of investments on edge. They do not have to be on the brink if you spend a little before you invest a lot. And once you understand innovation and technology, you can see where these innovators are not crazy mad people, but dreamers... their world is not about the money, it is about getting their idea working in reality. Give them the space, time, resources... Hire an illustrator/animation team to extract their idea, so everyone can then touch it, see it, smell it..., etc...

Share your thoughts as an investor, how do you deal not with the stock portfolio or widget factory, but the guy turning nothing into something. You put that in your portfolio, you have a story and the wealth to show it. 

My bottom line is: I believe all this talk about market testing, columns and rows and 100's of pages of due-diligence is wrong. You put the right investor(s) and the latest Elon Musk together; you have an engine of wealth. 

Now that you made it to here... Vote me up, Link, spread the word? Feel free to send a reply! Love it!

46,2016-12-19,Goal1,35,Is investing not as successful as it was back in the day?,"I was recently looking at historical data sheets from many big name companies and it brought a realization to light. AMZN traded for $1.51 when it was first publicly released and is now worth $757.77. SBUX was trading for $0.35 and is now worth nearly $60.

It seems that if you were investing in the 90's you had extreme profit gains. Is the same possible now? I feel as if we are stuck putting money into expensive shares of companies that ""made it"". Where is the room for extreme gains like that we saw during the 90s? What are the equivalent companies today? Were people in the 90s aware of companies such as Starbucks and Amazon?"
47,2016-12-18,Sim915,13,[Discussion] Reliq Health Technologies (CVE:RHT),"**Outline:**
RHT is working on an app which connects healthcare professionals and patients, along with the patient's circle of care (i.e. family, friends, anybody able to assist in outpatient care). Their aim is to provide automated monitoring through proximity sensors and wearable biometric devices, and to facilitate communication within the circle of care.

**Pros**

+ There are three already established pilots (Florida, LA, UK), and one white-label contract (to the estimated value of $1.2M; San Antonio, TX) commencing February 2017.

+ The company's and NHS' (UK) aims with regard to treatment are highly aligned, accordingly the NHS has expressed considerable interest in RHT.

+ Progressions towards mHealth (mobile health) incentivized by significant reduction in cost to healthcare systems through ease of administration.

+ Patient outcomes improved through more efficient health monitoring, further reduces costs by mitigating such fines as those imposed by e.g. Medicaid for preventable readmissions. 

+ In future RHT will establish Big Data services, providing another source of revenue.

**Cons**

- Liabilities of ~$1.3M, at present the biggest obstacle for RHT appears to be the accrued debt. Their cash runway is projected to last until Q1-2017, at which point the revenue from the aforementioned contract in TX will be their lifeline, unless they also acquire further financing from other sources.

- Currently not profitable, projection for profitability is in 2017. 

- Some degree of trust to overcome with some patients' expressed worry over cybersecurity.


I presently have no shares in RHT, however wanted to post about it here in order to discuss and clarify the viability of the company. If anybody has any further pros or cons to add from DD I've missed, let me know and I'll update the list."

49,2016-12-02,matt_shitty,1010,Matt_shitty's 2016 Dividend Value Investing Letter to Shareholders - 20 companies to buy in 2017 and hold forever.,"This post is a followup to my [well-received post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3yxbkn/my_10_stocks_to_buy_in_2016_value_largecap/) earlier this year. 

Hi Friends,

I’m writing this letter to you because I’ve identified you as someone who is or may be interested in learning more about long-term investing. I have too many friends who have decided that investing is too complex for them, and they either write off investing altogether or pay a mutual fund company thousands of dollars in fees over their lifetime. I have spent the past several years reading everything I can and teaching myself how to be a successful investor. I’m still very much an idiot, but I realize that my knowledge today can help you make better investment decisions for your future. 

*Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago*. – Warren Buffett

I’d like to start with an introduction about my investing style.

***Dividend Value Investing***

*Time is the friend of the wonderful company, the enemy of the mediocre.* – Warren Buffett

My investing style closely resembles the value investing style espoused by Warren Buffett mixed with a heavy emphasis on dividends. Value investing is characterized by buying high quality, dividend paying companies at reasonable prices.  

How do I ensure a company is high-quality? A high-quality company will have a wide moat, meaning other companies will have a tough time gaining market share from the wide-moat company. An example of a company with a wide moat is Union Pacific Railroad. It is tough if not impossible for a company to come in, buy land, gain permits, purchase cars, and start laying tracks.

 I favor boring companies who sell products people will continue to buy 25+ years in the future. People will still need toothpaste, band-aids, and water 30 years from now. 

 I like companies that generate lots of cash each quarter. High quality companies exhibit stable, 10+ year trends of increasing earnings per share (EPS).  These companies should have management which uses this cash to make strategic acquisitions or returns this capital to shareholders via dividends (preferably both). 

Specific metrics I use to make sure a company is high-quality:

* **Dividend Yield &gt; 2%** – This is how much the money you invest in a company will earn via dividends throughout the year. I like companies with a greater dividend yield than the general market. The sweet spot for dividend yield range tends to be 2.4-5%. Dividends are passive income currently taxed at a 15% rate.
* **Payout Ratio &lt;70%** - Tells how much of a company’s earnings are currently being paid out via dividends. I want to ensure a company can continue to increase their dividend without eroding earnings.
*** Return on Equity  (5 year median) &gt; 10%** - This formula tells how much net income is returned as a percentage of shareholders equity.  This formula is used to measure management’s effectiveness of using shareholder’s capital to generate earnings. High return on equity = high quality management.
* **Earnings Per Share (10 year growth) &gt; 10** -  This shows on average how much a company increases its growth rate by over 10 years. I like to see companies who have weathered 10 years of the economic cycle, and still have managed to grow earnings by 10% on average. 
* **Debt to equity ratio &lt;.55** – Debt to equity ratio is a measure financial leverage. It calculates a company’s total liabilities and divides it by shareholder’s equity. The lower the number the better as it means a company isn’t using debt to finance its assets. A low debt level ensures a company can withstand an economic downturn.

***Margin of Safety***

*Rule #1: Don’t lose money. Rule #2: Don’t forget rule #1* – Warren Buffett

Warren Buffett talks about ensuring your investments have “a high margin of safety”. Margin of safety is ensured by making sure the companies you are buying are undervalued, and able to withstand deteriorating market conditions. 
 
An undervalued company is not likely to go down as much during a recession as a highly valued, growth company. Investors get greedy during bull markets. Stocks like Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla get bid up on the expectation that money will keep flowing, and growth will continue forever in the double digits. In a recession, these high growth stocks drop the fastest and hardest. You instead want companies whose value metrics are relatively lower than the general market, as these companies offer safety in case the 7 year bull run goes the other way. 

Specific metrics I look at to check if a company is undervalued are:
 
* **PE (Price to Earnings Ratio) &lt; market’s average** – Price to earnings measures the price of the stock divided by the earnings per share. This is a basic way to see how a stock is being valued compared to its past. I look at the forward PE because it takes the current price divided by the future year’s earnings estimates. This ratio provides a way to see what a company’s PE will look like if they meet their earnings estimates. 
* **PE&lt; 10 year median PE** – A good way to check how PE compares to historical PE for the company
* **PS (Price to Sales Ratio) &lt; 10 year PS** – Measures current price of stock to current sales. This compares to the historical PS average. 
* **PB (Price to Book Ratio) &lt; 10 year PB** – Measures the price of the stock divided by the book value of the company. This compares to the historical PB ratio.
* **PE &lt; Industry Avg PE** – We want the PE of the stock to ideally be lower than its industry’s PE. Certain industries will usually have a higher PE. Technology companies will usually have higher PE than a paper company.
* **EPS 10 year chart** A favorite method of mine to see if a company is undervalued is comparing the 10 year chart of a company’s stock price, with the 10 year earnings per share (EPS) overlayed. When the EPS is rising , and the share price is down, it’s a good indicator that shares are undervalued. This method was popularized in the book, Purple Chips.

***Dividend Growth***

*Compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it…he who doesn’t pays it* –Albert Einstein

When I buy stock in a company, I plan on holding it long term, ideally 20+ years. It’s important to me that a business/company can do well in recessions and bull markets. Slow and steady growth is the name of the game. Dividend growth is extremely important to me. Dividends have accounted for 30% of stock returns over the past 80 years. When management raises the dividend, it is the ultimate signal that management is confident earnings will continue to grow. Dividends cannot be fudged on accounting statements. The money is paid directly to you quarterly, and will be taxed at a 15% rate. 

If I buy a company currently yielding 5%, and it raises their dividend 10% every year, after 10 years I will be earning a 10% yield on my original investment, and this doesn’t include any stock price appreciation. Earning 10% on your money is unbeatable, even in a high-interest environment. My goal is to generate $80,000 in passive income via dividends to draw upon for retirement by 2036. 

***Market Timing &amp; Greed***

*Time in the market beats timing the market.*

*Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful* – Warren Buffett

The biggest mistake people make with investing is letting their emotions of fear and greed interferes with sticking to a sound investment philosophy. Wall Street makes billions each year off naïve investors buying at the top, and then selling when things look like there is no hope.
  
The fact is the stock market is wildly unpredictable. Like a manic-depressive person, no one truly ever knows whether the market will go up or down. By investing in solid companies that pay dividends, you will make money no matter which way the market decides to go. It helps if your retirement date is 10+ years out. Time is on your side. You can withstand paper losses that recessions will bring. Don’t sell and keep reinvesting your dividends and extra capital. Slow and steady will win the race, and you will be rewarded for your patience and steady emotions.

*Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a fly epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497*- Warren Buffett

***Companies I am Buying or Adding to My Positon:***

In order of largest to smallest holding percentage:

* 1. **Johnson &amp; Johnson - JNJ**

My largest holding. JNJ is a diversified healthcare company. You probably know them for their consumer health business where they make band-aids, baby shampoo, and Tylenol. Their other 2 businesses include medical devices and their fastest growing-pharmaceuticals. JNJ has raised their dividend for 54 straight years. Their management is top-notch, and they are approaching a reasonable PE ratio of around 19. 

*  2.**Lockheed Martin – LMT**

Lockheed Martin is an aerospace and defense company who sells stealth jets, missile and radar systems, and space flight vehicles. Their customers are primarily the US government and its NATO allies. Lockheed’s price has increased recently with Trump and Republicans winning. People expect the US military to increase spending over the next 4 years. Lockheed pays a nice dividend of 2.8%. Management has grown profits very well over the past 10 years. Do I feel scummy investing in the military industrial complex? Sometimes. I also think there are a lot of bad people out there, and we need advanced weaponry to provide a deterrent against them. I expect Lockheed to do extremely well as governments continue to upgrade against global terrorism. 

* 3.**Royal Dutch Shell – RDS.B**

Royal Dutch Shell is an energy company selling oil, natural gas, and renewables. Like most energy companies, their prices has dropped significantly since the price of oil dropped from $100 to its current $50 a barrel. Shell has been moving away from oil, and recently spent $50 billion to acquire BG Group, the largest natural gas supplier. Shell’s dividend is currently 7%, and they are committed to paying it throughout this oil downturn. Oil may not reach $100 a barrel, but OPEC will not let oil continue to decline as it has over the past year. Since I wrote this, OPEC announced production cuts so that oil-dependent countries like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia can stop losing billions of dollars each year. Shell is paying you 7% to wait out this oil decline. The world will continue to need more energy, which is why I am adding to my holding. 

* 4.**Welltower – HCN**

Welltower is a healthcare Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that buys and manages senior housing, post acute care, and assisted living centers. REIT’s are required to pay out 90% of its profits in dividends, which is why Welltower is currently yielding 5.5%. Baby boomers are just at the beginning of retiring en masse. Anyone with an older relative realizes how important and necessary senior living centers are. Welltower has been paying dividends for 30+ years. I like Welltower as a stable income producing company who will experience growth for the next 10-20 years as people continue to get old, live longer, and utilize senior housing.

* 5.**Cisco – CSCO**

Cisco designs, manufactures, and sells Internet based networking products and services. Their bread and butter are data center and enterprise switches, routers, conferencing systems, and their fast-growing cyber security businesses. They are the market leader in helping computers talk with one another. Cisco current trades at a 12 forward PE, which is significantly lower than the general market’s PE of 20. Their PE and price to sales numbers are currently lower than their 5 and 10 year medians. Cisco has a great CEO in John Chambers. They have an operating margin of 25% and current free cash flow of 12b. Their dividend is a solid 3.5%. This is a great tech company to buy and hold.

* 6.**International Business Machines – IBM**

IBM is considered a dinosaur in the tech world, and some people foolishly write them off because of this. IBM is in the middle of a multi-year transformation away from traditional businesses like software and IT outsourcing to their “strategic imperative” businesses of big data &amp; analytics, cloud mobile, and social/security. More recently, IBM has developed the AI technology, Watson. You may have seen Watson win the show Jeopardy a few years back. IBM has a low PE, huge cash reserves, and excellent returns on assets/equity. IBM has transformed itself multiple times in its 100+ year history. I will collect their 3.5% dividend yield as they do it again.

* 7.**Abbvie Pharmaceuticals – ABBV**

Abbvie is a research based company focusing on treating conditions such as Parkinson’s, HIV, cancer, dermatology, cystic fibrosis, and other conditions. Abbvie was spun off from the blue chip, Abbot Labs, in 2012. Abbvie’s stock price has remained stagnant over the past year as concerns about its top selling drug, Humira’s, patents due to expire. Humira makes up 60% of Abbvie’s sales. Abbvie has lawyers upon lawyers to postpone the expiration of its patent. I believe there is too much pessimism about Abbvie’s future earnings dropping. They trade at a forward PE of 12 compare to the industry average of 22. They have a return on equity and assets of 118% and 10% respectively. Management raised the dividend last month signaling they expect Abbvie’s earnings to continue to grow. They have a 5 year dividend growth rate of over 40%. Abbvie is a rare chance own a great pharma company while collecting a 4.3% dividend yield.

* 8.**Union Pacific Railways – UNP**

Who wants to own a railroad in 2016? Union Pacific runs several railways in the Western United States. These railways primarily ship coal, chemicals, and industrial products (do you know a President elect who like coal and building steel walls?). They have a duopoly with Burlington Santa Fe allowing them to command a 37% operating margin. They have grown their income 16% yearly over the past 10 years. Their dividend is currently 2.3%, but they have grown that dividend 16% over the past 5 years.  Union Pacific has an extremely wide moat. I used to think of railways as inefficient and non-environmentally friendly. Did you know railways can move freight 436 miles on one gallon of fuel. Try doing that in a semi or 747. 

* 9.**John Deere and Co – DE**

John Deere is known for their big green tractors, but they also sell dump trucks, loaders, excavators, and anything else to help farmers get better yields. We are currently in the middle of a 5 year lull in corn prices. When corn prices pick up, this gives farmers more money to upgrade their equipment. Deere is an extremely cyclical company, and their price has increased much in the past year as people expect corn prices to rebound. I’d wait for a pullback to initiate a position in them. Still they have an excellent brand, with a long history of rewarding shareholders. They currently yield 2.6% and are increasing their dividend 11% on a yearly average over the past 5 years.

* 10.**Novo Nordisk – NVO**

Novo Nordisk is a healthcare company whose two main businesses are diabetes and obesity care. I hope to never have to utilize their drugs and services, but I also understand I’m in the minority. Most people in the US and world are getting fatter. We rely on cars for transportation, sit at desks 8+ hours a day, and are too lazy to exercise. Even worse we have super cheap junk food at our fingertips 24/7. This trend is only continuing as billions of people in China and India enter the “modern world”. Sounds bleak, but don’t worry, Novo Nordisk is there to get you your insulin and diabetes devices. They are also involved with hormone replacement therapy products. Novo has sold off 40% this year over concerns of drug pricing pressure in the United States. They are at a 52 week low. They generate tons of money, yield 2.6%, and are trading at historic lows. 

* 11.**Cummins– CMI**

Cummins designs, manufactures, and distributes diesel and natural gas engines. They have a free cash flow of 1.5b, a forward PE of 14, and have grown earnings by 10% each year over the past 5 years. They currently yield 3%, with a long history of paying/increasing dividends. They have a strong brand in a great niche market. 


* 12.**Schweitzer-Mauduit International – SWM**

This is a new holding for me. SWM is a paper and plastics company. 60% of their business is in producing cigarette papers. Governments around the world mandate cigarette companies use their Lower Ignition Prospensity (LIP) papers. These papers ensure cigarettes do not light on fire when dropped to the ground. This business is slowing as cigarette consumption drops around the world. In 2012, new management came in and changed their strategy to diversify their business away from cigarette papers. They now make water filtration systems, tea bags, and other specialty products. The transformation is working as net income has grown 18% each year over the past 5 years. They have a return on equity /assets of 17 and 8%. Operating margin of 15%, and a forward PE of 12. Their debt to equity ratio is a little high at .51, but management is committed to paying down debt from their recent acquisitions. Even better their dividend yields 4%, and has grown 11% per year over the past 5 years. An upcoming catalyst for them could be selling papers to the marijuana industry. More states and countries countinue to legalize marijuana. These sales can help offset the decline of their cigarette business.  


* 13.**TD Bank – TD**

TD Bank is headquartered in Toronto, Canada. They have a great steady business with management that pays a dividend yield of 3.5%. Canadian banks are more steady growers than their riskier US counterparts. TD Bank has room to continue growing their earnings and dividend.

* 14.**Visa – V**

Visa is an anomaly in my portfolio. They trade at a high PE (29) and pay a paltry dividend (.86%). Visa is a growth stock. Visa runs the world’s largest payment network. They do not assume any of the responsibilities with fraud or credit card debt. They just collect their 2.5% on every transaction made when someone uses a card with Visa on it. The world will continue to use less cash as e-commerce grows. Visa has rarely traded at a reasonable PE ratio. This is mostly due to their incredible business. They have an operating margin of 65% with no signs on this slowing down.

* 15.**T Rowe Price – TROW**

T Rowe Price provides financial advice and mutual funds. They have grown their dividend 27 years in a row, and currently yield 2.9%. They are currently trading at a forward PE of 16 compared to their 10 year median of 24. Their business and management is truly a blue-chip. They have a return on equity/assets of 24 and 18%, showing that they can invest in themselves and make money. 

* 16.**Boeing – BA**

Boeing’s businesses are airplanes and defense. They are trading at a forward PE of 20.55 compared to a 10 year median of 28. They have 8.4b in free cash flow. Their dividend yield 3%. Their net income and dividends continue to grow. This a blue chip with a wide moat, and 42 years of dividend increases.

* 17.**Tesoro– TSO**

Tesoro refines petroleum and bio-fuel products. They also have a great gas station retail business. More and more Americans continue to drive, especially in the Western States where Tesoro operates. They have made strategic acquisitions that will allow them to continue paying a decent dividend (2.5%) and increasing their income. 

 
* 18.**Walmart – WMT**

Walmart is like IBM in that they are in the middle of a huge transformation, and they have a very, very long history of making successful transitions They were a little late to e-commerce, but concerns about Amazon taking them over were overdone. They have a huge transportation and logistics advantage over every retailer in the world. Their low price model has proven successful in China, Mexico, and India. They have made huge investments in e-commerce to compete with Amazon in the United States. At a PE of 15, and dividend growth for 41+ years, Walmart is still a bargain.

* 19.**Western Digital – WDC**

Western digital sells storage hard drives and solid state drives. Their business will continue to grow as more storage is needed for all of the pictures, videos, and data we continue to share. Their forward PE is 9, dividend yield of 3.4%. This is a great tech company that will reap the benefits from their aqusition of Sandisk.

* 20.**Nike – NKE**

Nike has been my worst performer over the past year (down 16%). Their PE has gone from 30 to 22, highlighting why it’s never good to pay a premium, especially in retail. I still think Nike has a bright future, and this is as good a time as any to buy part of the company. Their dividend was increased so that they yield 1.5%. If you have traveled overseas, you know how popular the brand is abroad. They still dominate in shoe sales. They own the brands converse, who’s Chuck Taylors remain popular. Athletic wear is a fast growing market. They recently announced their $700 self-lacing shoe called the HyperAdapt which has been sold out everywhere, and are currently being sold for $5000+ on ebay. I don’t like retail stocks, but Nike and VFC are the only companies in the space I would consider owning.


There you have it friends. I’d like to continue writing a letter like this once a year. My wife and I are having our first child next year, so I’m not entirely sure how much time or money we will have to invest. Still, please let me know if you would like to continue receiving these letters. I would love to hear your thoughts. A link to my investment workbook is below. Keep investing for the future. Once you build that nest egg, have a plan to use that money and free time to better others’ lives.
