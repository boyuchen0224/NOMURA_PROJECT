0,2017-01-23,Ampix0,15,Lets talk about QCOM and INTC?,"I own a few shares of both, as both are going to be huge innovators over the next ten years or so I would say. I think buying now is probably not a terrible idea for either, and be safe for the next few years.

However.

Intel failed to deliver 5G modems before Qualcomm which they had a huge push for. Currently it seems unclear who the leader of 5G will be, but many suspect it will be Qualcomm. 
Personally I also believe Intel is backed into the PC market corner and is spreading itself very thin to try and branch out into other markets. They have no clear focus that I can see for their many side projects other than 5G which may not pan out. They do however have an impressive storage technology called 3D storage, but they will have competition and their name isn't huge in storage.


Qualcomm has a promising future even outside of 5G, though it is extremely likely they will be the dominators of 5G in my opinion. Qualcomm will likely be found in many or higher end smart devices and will continue to be in phones almost definitely. However if they do lose 5G it may be a significant blow to them.
What I'm worried about with QCOM right now, is they are being sued by the FTC and Apple. I don't consider myself anywhere near educated enough to make any estimates of what's going to happen here and I don't know the facts. But QCOM price is dropping fast. I find it unlikely that the company couldn't come back after even both of these suits pretending they lost both. So in my mind I am hoping now is just a good time to buy, or if not now then after the verdicts.

Warning: my stock portfolio is terrible and you should consider my advice as bad advice, but let's discuss.

1,2017-01-11,cantbelieveitsbacon,8,CES 2017: Datacenter REITs the winners?,"From what I've seen, everything showcased at CES that made the headlines relies on transferring gobloads of data to and from remote servers. 

Smart driving cars rely on constant communication with datacenters.

Smart gadgets are only smart if they can info back and forth from remote servers in datacenters.

5G wireless bandwidth increase is for ioT and gadgets talking to the cloud... well the cloud is in fact datacenters.

It seems the corner stone of all the tech displayed at CES is datacenters with seemingly infinite bandwidth and processing power.

Yet I've seen very little mention in the press about data centers. After all the ""C"" in CES stands for ""Consumer"". Consumers don't see data centers.

But I'm trying to take a step back and look at the big picture. if anyone is going to profit from these new techs, it's Data Center REITs, right?

2,2017-01-10,mega_reddit,12,What do you all think of Nokia?,"I picked up a very small number of shares of Nokia today at $4.85. I've done quite a bit of research on them and see them as a 5g (mobile internet connection) play. They're not a mobile phone company anymore (they only license out the brand to HMD Global) which I see as a common thing people focus on and I don't think the mobile phone licensing will have a material impact on the company. However, with 5g this company is working to make it a reality all over the world. Just Google ""[Country Name] 5G"" and read a few articles and it will mention Nokia. I've researched a lot of regions and countries of the world and it doesn't look like 5g will be out until 2020. However the roll out of 5g will be a progression from 4g, 4.5g, 4.5g Pro, 4.9g, to 5g. So there will be steady revenue for Nokia over 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020+. Why is 5g important? Because of the internet of things. Almost every device in the future will be connected to the internet. 5g is required for this capacity. 5g is required for autonomous vehicles and a million other technologies that rely on top notch speed and low latency with high capacity. Preliminary tests of 5g will begin in the U.S. with Verizon in 2017. South Korea is already starting. Nokia has strong ties with South Korea Telecom and Japan and china operators such as china mobile. Also note, Nokia is the biggest player by market share at 30%.

Basically to sum it up: Nokia's got ties to the telecom infastructure of 150+ countries which will need infastructure updates over the next 3+ years."
3,2017-02-25,best_never_rests,2,Thoughts on $NOK,"I was reading that Nokia is making some moves on buying $1 billion in debt and talks of going 5G. 
There is also the MCW coming up this Monday which can possibly push the SP up, depending on the news. 
They are not just a phone company anymore so that really interests me 

Just want to get your thoughts on this. 
Much appreciated. "
4,2017-03-16,MoonStache,16,Curious of others thoughts on $NOK calls,"Nokia seems to be doing well lately. There is a huge opportunity in 5G and I suspect their new lineup of phones will do well.

I was considering purchase some far out calls for January. They're so cheap and I figure the upside could be huge while losses would be minimal if they don't perform.

Thoughts?"
5,2017-04-14,wsace,42,Investing in 5G Technology,"What is 5G:
https://5g.co.uk/guides/what-is-5g/

So basically it seems like this tech is going to be game changing from 2019 / 2020. 

Who are the main patent holders:

http://www.telecomtv.com/articles/5g/if-you-thought-patents-got-ugly-with-lte-just-wait-until-5g-13458/

By checking the graphs we can see that the 3 main companies involved in 5g will be NASDAQ:IDCC, NASDAQ:QCOM, HEL:NOKIA (for American investors: NYSE:NOK). 

Is it worth buying these companies now? For example Qualcomm seems like a great business with temporary problems due to the lawsuits. InterDigital has consistent growth in revenue per share and operating margin % expansion. Nokia is maybe the riskiest form the 3 companies as they are still not making any profit. 

What are your thoughts on buying these companies and holding them for 5 - 10 years with the following proportions: 
 - 40% Qualcomm
 - 40% InterDigital
 - 20% Nokia"
6,2017-05-15,nickzx6r,0,"2k in one stock long term? WMT, T, VZ, MSFT, JD, BABA.","at least a year possibly way longer if i don't have to use it to buy a house. sort of looking to set and forget. already maxed out my ROTH with vanguard and have about 14k in other stocks.

first four i like cause of dividend and walmart and MSFT i have good understanding about and don't see them going anywhere anytime soon even with amazon around. at&amp;t and verizon are competing on who will get ahead of the curve and start 5g, but it is a toss up for me atm. 
BABA and JD i am not too familiar with, but from my understanding they are chinese versions of amazon with BABA having sort of a monopoly over there. my worry is if the laws become more lenient and competition increase how would they be affected?

atm i am leaning toward BABA cause of amazon like potential, but not sure if it would be good long term investment as my understanding of its potential is not that great.

could u guys enlighten me or give me some guidance on above companies? pros/cons to each etc? thanks "
7,2017-05-08,boshbosh92,9,$STRP,"So, AT&amp;T T offered to buy STRP for $1.25b, a 160% premium.

On April 25th, Straightpath announced they'd received a 'superior' offer. It was announced today it was offered $3.1b + the $38 million contract cancellation between AT&amp;T.

It is strongly thought the bidder (this may be confirmed by now) was Verizon. Now, AT&amp;T is larger in market cap, but I feel like Verizon is more prominent in cellphones. This is likely just a geographical thing though.

STRP is highly desired because they own a lot of the frequency licenses for 5g networks. Basically whoever owns STRP has significant leverage over the beginning of 5g. 

Do you think AT&amp;T is gonna counter-offer or do you think the run is over?"

9,2017-07-25,InterestingNews1,14,"Cell and wireless tower REIT, Crown Castle, sees growth boosted by rising connectivity. Valuation looks inexpensive with yield of 3.83%.","Wireless tower operator Crown Castle International (CCI) has seen its performance boosted by the increasing number of carriers offering unlimited data to customers while increasing connectivity generally looks set to boost demand for the foreseeable future.

Q2 results last week showed no let up in growth with revenues up 8%, net income up 30% and adjusted funds fom operations (AFFO) rising 12%.  Additionally the company raised guidance with AFFO now to increase 13% to $1.82bn.

With a market cap of $36.3bn that puts the valuation on a multiple of 20x AFFO with a yield of 3.83%.  Not bad for a REIT with significant growth prospects.

The cell tower business continues to benefit frowm increasing connectivity with smart phones and unlimited data plans being the main drivers.  While the rate of user growth is now slowing in the US it is still expected to increase by 20% by 2021.  However, overall the mobile data requirement is expected to increase four fold over the same period.

CCI also reported the acquisition of Lightower which will boost AFFO by a further c.$400 million and increase the fiber network footprint significantly in preparation for the roll out of next generation 5G wireless technology.

Jay Brown, Crown Castleâ€™s Chief Executive Officer, summed it all up quite nicely at the call;

""We had another terrific quarter exceeding our previously provided Outlook for net income, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term positive fundamentals for mobile data demand growth with our leading portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure across towers and small cells.  As the wireless carriers turn to our infrastructure to improve and enhance their networks to meet what is expected to be a four-fold increase in mobile data demand by 2021, we believe there is a sustained runway of organic growth opportunities on our existing portfolio as well as opportunities for us to make accretive investments that enhance our long-term growth profile.""

10,2017-10-24,ohrlee,82,How to invest in 5G?,"A few years ago, I posted about what companies will be growth investments and 10x in size in the future.  My pick at the time was Universal Display ($OLED) which is still on its run up with thesis playing true.  Great and all...

However, it's about time to identify the next greatest stock investment and I'd like your help.  One of the themes I've identified is 5G mobile networks, an anticipated 2020+ technology that solves existing constrained data rates, latency, and will enable next generation technologies including autonomous driving, IOT, and many others that are data intensive and require the throughputs and latency.  It's still in its infancy today and bringing 5G to reality does not come without its challenges (e.g. such as standards), but that presents opportunity and is an inevitability for me.

What is the best positioned companies that manufacture antenna, small cell, radio frequency chips, cell tower, fiber, radio spectrum, patent holders in 5G?  Who are the enablers of all this?

Again, margin of safety is key so a history of top line growth and profitability are ideal, with strong balance including little to no debt.  I'm trying to identify the no-brainer investment here that is on the cusp (could be few years) of a J-curve.

Some companies I've come across include: $SWKS, $COMM, $CCI,  $AMT, $IDCC, $QCOM, $NXPI, $AVGO, $ZAYO, $NOK, $ERIC.  Then there's the traditional carriers like $VZ, $T but those are less interesting.  $STRP is a prime example of a quality tech candidate that went up 5x with $VZ's offer to acquire.

Cheers and let's make money together."
