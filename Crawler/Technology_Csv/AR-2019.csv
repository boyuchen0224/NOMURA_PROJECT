&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Apple Inc. plans to launch iPhones with a more-powerful 3-D camera as soon as next year, stepping up the company’s push into augmented reality, according to people familiar with the plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The rear-facing, longer-range 3-D camera is designed to scan the environment to create three-dimensional reconstructions of the real world. It will work up to about 15 feet from the device, the people said. That’s in contrast with the current iPhone 3-D camera system, which points toward users and operates at distances of 25 to 50 centimeters to power Apple’s Face ID facial-recognition feature.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s new system uses a laser scanner, rather than the existing dot-projection technology which doesn’t work as well over longer distances, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unreleased features. That’s just one of many new features -- including a third, more advanced camera, enhanced photo-capture tools and a more powerful chip -- that Apple plans to include in coming generations of iPhones, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The laser-powered 3-D camera would enhance augmented reality on the iPhone, allowing for more accurate depth perception and placement of virtual objects. It could also help the handset take photos that can better capture depth, the people said. Apple has been in talks with Sony Corp. about testing sensors for the new system, one of the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;While virtual reality immerses the user in a digital realm, AR overlays visuals and data onto a view of the real world. Use cases include looking at a building and displaying details of the structure beside the image, or listing repair instructions for a mechanic while she works on a defective machine. It’s been touted as having wider mass-market appeal than VR, and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has talked up its prospects.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 2020 iPhone camera may be a prelude to an AR headset that Apple has been preparing for as early as 2020. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s plans, which could change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple previously aimed to put the new 3-D camera system on the back of this year’s high-end iPhones, but delayed that, the people familiar also said. Still, the Cupertino, California-based technology giant is doubling down on camera capabilities for its handsets.  
&gt;  
&gt;For 2019, Apple plans successors to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max -- code-named D42 and D43 -- and an update to the iPhone XR, said the people. The larger of the new high-end iPhones will have three cameras on the back, and other handsets could eventually come with the upgraded system, too, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Cameras have become one of the most-important features in a saturated smartphone market. Better photos are a compelling reason for people to upgrade their handsets, especially when other new capabilities are either harder to design or too wonky for most customers to appreciate. Apple pioneered smartphone camera improvements, which over the years have included additions like Portrait Mode. Rivals have tried to catch up, with Samsung Electronics Co. launching phones with as many as four outward-facing cameras last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The iPhone still generates the majority of Apple’s revenue, although sales of the devices fell last year as people upgraded less often. That triggered a stock slump that wiped more than $300 billion off the company’s market value since October. New models with more-capable cameras could spur upgrades and reignite Apple’s growth, making these upcoming iPhones the most critical in years.  
&gt;  
&gt;A third camera on the back of the 2019 iPhone will help the device capture a larger field of view and enable a wider range of zoom. It will also capture more pixels so Apple software could, for example, automatically repair a video or photo to fit in a subject that may have been accidentally cut off from the initial shot, according to the people familiar with the plans. The company is also planning an enhanced version of its Live Photos feature, which pins video from before and after each shot to the photo. The new version will double the length of the video from three seconds to six seconds.  
&gt;  
&gt;The laser-powered 3-D camera could debut first on an upgrade to the iPad Pro currently planned for as early as spring 2020, according to one of the people. Apple isn’t expected to release a major iPad Pro update this year like it did in 2018. It typically upgrades the line in the second half of the year. Apple in the past has launched major new features on the iPad before the iPhone, including 4G internet connectivity in 2012.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple is also testing some versions of this year’s iPhone line that includes a USB-C connector instead of the Lightning port that has been used on iPhones since 2012, indicating that the company plans an eventual switch, according to one of the people. Moving to USB-C would make the new models compatible with chargers used for hundreds of other devices, like Android phones.  
&gt;  
&gt;This year’s iPhone models will include an upgraded Apple processor and use an updated Face ID sensor for unlocking the device and approving payments, the people said. The handsets will otherwise look similar to the current models with larger changes expected as early as 2020 to accommodate plans for 5G networking capabilities, Bloomberg News reported last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Beyond iPhones, Apple plans to release an updated version of its lower-cost iPad with a roughly 10-inch screen and a faster processor as early as this spring, according to people familiar with the plans. That device is expected to retain the Lightning port, according to one of the people. The company is also readying a new, cheaper iPad mini, its smallest tablet that hasn’t been updated since 2015, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s next operating system update, iOS 13, will include a dark mode option for easier nighttime viewing and improvements to CarPlay, the company’s in-vehicle software. There will also be iPad-specific upgrades like a new home screen, the ability to tab through multiple versions of a single app like pages in a web browser, and improvements to file management. The company will also integrate two new services, including a magazine subscription service and its original video content efforts, via iOS updates this year.   
&gt;  
&gt;Each year since 2012, Apple has launched its latest iPhone in September. The one exception was the iPhone X’s November release in 2017."

2,2019-03-21,SquirrelyStu,0,"Good time to invest in weapons companies? (RGR, AOBC)","It seems like with world events and an election coming there will be lots of people buying up guns and ammo. How can I take advantage of this by investing in certain weapons manufacturers like Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands? They are makers of among other things, AR-15 rifles.
Thoughts?"
3,2019-03-15,ghostofgbt,15,"A Brief Analysis of Five Major US Airlines - BA, DAL, UAL, AAL, JBLU","I'm sure many are aware by now that Boeing has had some bad publicity recently surrounding the seemingly difficult time their 737 Max 8 planes are having staying in the sky. Accordingly, the stock price has taken quite a hit and there is quite a circulation of negative press about the company, including a recent Bloomberg article that the recent crashes could potentially [put $600 billion in orders at risk](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-14/boeing-s-600-billion-in-max-orders-at-risk-as-airlines-retreat). 

In light of all this, I decided to take a quick look at Boeing compared to other major airlines in terms of their financials. I don't have a particular bias on this stock and have no position in it, I only wanted to see how it compares to other airlines and use that to determine how attractive it is compared to others, and thus whether it's worth doing a more detailed analysis on how much risk the news represents to a potential investment.

I'll be comparing Boeing to its closest domestic *airline* competition, since after all the recent news is about their planes, but keep in mind that because Boeing has significant military contracts it could also be compared with stocks like LMT, HON, GE, RTN and other major defense contractors and that I'm looking at the company as a whole and not segmenting it. Also keep in mind that since this is a current issue, news could be released 10 seconds after I submit this post that could completely change the game, but at the time of writing I'd say most of this stuff is accurate.

The companies in this comparison include (in order of size by market cap): 

- **Boeing** (BA)
- **Delta Airlines** (DAL)
- **United Airlines** (UAL)
- **American Airlines** (AAL)
- **JetBlue** (JBLU)

For this analysis I'm looking at several things: 

- Market Cap
- Revenue
- EPS
- Operating Cash Flow
- Cash and Cash Equivalents
- Current Ratio
- PE Ratio
- Red flags
- Potential manipulation of recent/future earnings

*All of this data is the most recent I've got. Charts that say data is as of 12/31/2018 are showing the normalized calendar date which allows comparison of companies that have different reporting periods*

-----

##**Market Capitalization:**

Airline | Market Cap (Billions)
-------|----------------------
BA  | $181.14
DAL | $34.21
UAL | $22.81
AAL | $14.79
JBLU | $4.89
Comparison | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/6hX8bge.png)

Boeing is clearly the largest by market cap, nearly six times the size of the next largest in line. By strict dollar value, it's the biggest player in this market right now and will probably stay that way for a while.

##**Revenue:**

Airline | Revenue (Billions)
-------|----------------------
BA  | $28.34
DAL | $10.74
UAL | $10.49
AAL | $10.94
JBLU | $1.97
Comparison | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/KhKvjep.png)

Boeing also generates nearly three times the sales of its closest competition. Delta, United and American are all in close competition, but Boeing seems to be several steps above the rest in terms of sales volume. As shown on the chart, Boeing's sales have also continued to grow over the last 8-10 years, while those of its competition seem to have flatlined.

##**Earnings per Diluted Share:**

Airline | EPS Diluted
-------|----------------------
BA  | $5.90
DAL | $1.53
UAL | $1.71
AAL | $0.69
JBLU | $0.54
Comparison | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/TyDFjVz.png)

While all of the airlines turn a profit overall, Boeing is by far the most profitable in terms of EPS. In close competition for 2nd and 3rd place are Delta and United, but American Airlines is actually closer to JetBlue in terms of earnings. Like their sales, Boeing's earnings continue to grow too, while the remaining airlines seem to have more erratic and volatile results.

##**Operating Cash Flow:**

Airline | Operating Cash Flow (Billions)
-------|----------------------
BA  | $2.95
DAL | $1.36
UAL | $1.10
AAL | $0.73
JBLU | $0.28
Comparison | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/GOrI648.png)

Earnings and sales aren't everything, but Boeing looks like it tends to outperform in terms of operating cash flow too, which is always a good sign. Again Delta and United are in close competition for 2nd and third place, and American and JetBlue lag behind a bit. BTW I made the chart for this one 3D since it was easier to see the colors that way.

##**Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents:**

Airline | Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents (Billions)
-------|----------------------
BA  | $7.64
DAL | $1.56
UAL | $4.05
AAL | $0.43
JBLU | $0.53
Comparison | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/oc5MnBy.png)

Cash is an important driver of business success. In this case it's actually Boeing and United in first and second place, with Delta coming in third. Having a lot of cash on hand is definitely good for Boeing, especially now, since they'll probably have to deal with lawsuits resulting from the recent 737 Max 8 crashes.

##**Current Ratio:**

Airline | Current Ratio
-------|----------------------
BA  | 1.0760
DAL | 0.3410
UAL | 0.5450
AAL | 0.4770
JBLU | 0.6100
Comparison | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/RgL6qYP.png)

From a liquidity perspective, Boeing is actually the only airline in the group that has more current assets than current liabilities. And, while Delta has been closely trailing Boeing in other areas, it's actually got pretty terrible liquidity. I'd definitely want to look into Delta's debt load and their debt covenants if I were going to invest in it, and same with the others besides Boeing, as none of them are particularly attractive. It's also worth noting that it seems by looking at the chart that there's been a systemic deterioration in current ratio for all these companies since about 2014. This indicates that there are likely to be some large reductions in assets or large increases in debt on the balance sheet over the last few years, and could indicate that there's a macroeconomic factor in play that we're not seeing here.  

##**PE Ratio:**

Airline | PE Ratio
-------|----------------------
BA  | 17.8670
DAL | 8.7700
UAL | 10.8320
AAL | 10.5630
JBLU | 26.7670
Comparison | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/Y0OioAY.png)

This is where we start to see a little divergence. In terms of the value of their stock relative to earnings, Boeing is the 2nd most expensive, second only to JetBlue. This means that Delta, United and American Airlines are a better value in terms of what you get ""per share"" but we should still consider the fact that each of these companies has their strengths and weaknesses.

##**Red Flags:**

Airline | Number of Flags Triggered | Flags Triggered
-------|----------------------|------
BA  | 6 of 48 | [Details](https://i.imgur.com/Atuh6sd.jpg)
DAL | 6 of 48 | [Details](https://i.imgur.com/Zxmn0im.jpg)
UAL | 8 of 48 | [Details](https://i.imgur.com/WKvbT8r.jpg)
AAL | 12 of 48 | [Details](https://i.imgur.com/3eUr1q3.jpg)
JBLU | 6 of 48 | [Details](https://i.imgur.com/rmVfIU2.jpg)

Of the five airlines, American Airlines triggered the most potential red flags, with United coming next and the other three tied in third place. Pretty much all of them triggered alerts regarding negative net cash flow, outliers in debt load and outliers in cash balances, which basically indicates that overall this business is driven heavily by debt funding and cash (I mean, they're building jets...they're not exactly cheap). 

They also unanimously triggered alerts that the AR/Sales and AP/Sales ratios are abnormally high, but that seems like its just normal for the industry given that most customers probably aren't going to shell out tens of millions in cash to buy a jet and most airlines aren't going to buy all the parts in cash. Instead, these purchases and sales are often made over time, which causes sales, receivables and payables to have some wonky ratios. That said though, since they all triggered those flags, I'd want to compare them to each other and decide if any of them look abnormal for the industry as a whole. 

Some of the more concerning things to me are American Airlines triggering the **negative book value alert**, the **negative free cash flow alert**, and the **operating cash flow/earnings inconsistency alert**. This suggests that American Airlines might be playing with the numbers a bit in order to meet earnings expectations. To that point, I'd want to dig into those flags particularly for American Airlines and see what triggered them.

Other than that, it seems most results are normal-ish.

##**Manipulation Potential (Beneish M-Score):**

Airline | Beneish M-Score | Over Time
-------|----------------------|------
BA  | -2.4949 | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/I8Gqncy.png)
DAL | -2.6605 | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/DqkZpZa.png)
UAL | -2.8683 | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/pvMCUCA.png)
AAL | -2.9151 | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/nVzc6hr.png)
JBLU | -2.6974 | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/xydih2T.png)

The Beneish M-Score looks at a number of metrics and uses their trends and relationships to other metrics to calculate a potential manipulation score. You can read more about that [here](https://www.scribd.com/doc/33484680/The-Detection-of-Earnings-Manipulation-Messod-D-Beneish) if you want. This same model was used (in part) to expose Enron back in the day so I think it's an interesting metric to look at. I've only shown the overall M-Score chart and their most recent values because otherwise there would be 8 charts for every company, but it still gives us a good idea.

Overall all of them seem unlikely to be manipulating their numbers, as they're all pretty far away from the threshold of -1.78. Delta, United and Jet Blue have come close to it or triggered it a couple times in the past, but nothing too alarming. It looks like overall the numbers are going to be pretty free from accounting magic, barring things this metric didn't catch that the red flags above may have.

##**Manipulation Potential (Benford's Law):**

Airline | Abs Max Deviation | Details
-------|----------------------|-----
BA  | 5.19% | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/Yhs8mZn.png)
DAL | 2.97% | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/UWtKyOg.png)
UAL | 4.12% | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/nnVxo8x.png)
AAL | 7.30% | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/FECNpMU.png)
JBLU | 3.38% | [Chart](https://i.imgur.com/U9GcaTl.png)

Finally I looked at each company's Benford's Law distribution. This is a measure of the ""normalcy"" of the companies' financial data based on the leading digit. Basically, the red bars in the charts are supposed to follow the black line perfectly in an ideal world. The red line overlaid across the bottom of the chart indicates the deviation from the norm of each leading digit. I looked at the absolute value of the max deviation (either up or down vs the norm), and that's what's in this table here. As we can see AAL (the one that triggered the most red flags) has also deviated from the norm the most of any of the airlines. This means that in terms of being likely to have messed with their numbers in order to massage them into something appealing for Wall Street, American Airlines leads the pack. Boeing and United also deviated a bit, but having looked at a bunch of companies this way I find the ones that are concerning to be up in the 7-10% or higher range. In that sense, none of the others really seem to have a problem. 

---------------

All of that said I think that Boeing has a great chance of still being a good buy down here. They've already issued a software patch for what they suspect is the problem with their planes, and hopefully after some more investigation they'll get it straightened out. Out of the others, I would only personally stay away from American Airlines and JetBlue. American Airlines requires closer scrutiny of their cash flow, EPS, and potentially their accounting policies. JetBlue on the other hand doesn't seem too terrible, it's just not very profitable and it's very expensive compared to its peers.

Hope everyone finds this useful and learned something, or at least likes all the pretty charts and tables! Here's the [source for all those by the way](https://www.lazyfa.com).

20 years ago MSFT was also number one company by market cap in the world followed by a relatively diverse group of ""old-money"" companies like GE, oil/gas companies, Coca-Cola etc. 

Given the acceleration of ""tech companies"" over the past 20 years allowing the other three to join Microsoft in being the biggest, is there any reason to think they'll lose momentum any time in the near or long future to another industry?

Any futuristic fields like AI/AR/VR that are gaining momentum will either be dominated via the big 4/5, or by a start-up that's inevitably absorbed by one of the big 4/5--and at this point in time it's hard to imagine a separate industry, whether or not it exists today overtaking what we have in place for technology today.

Compared to the past dominant industries, e.g. telecommunications, oil/gas, banking, health care, even without the aid of hindsight it seems like there was eventually a peak there, or potential for a new industry to come in. But for me it's hard to see with 'technology' as it is today."

9,2019-07-24,jumpjumpskate,1,[Forex Broker Exposure] GPAK Has Been Investigated by the Police,"As the financial market with the most frequent transactions, the Forex market is favored by global investors due to its high efficiency, liquidity and flexibility. However, many illegal brokers also lurk around on this lucrative market, attracting investors with appealing yet misleading advertisement such as “starting trading with only US$5” and “speedy deposit and withdrawal”, or promising investors so-called “bonus” for successfully inviting others to open account at the platform. But behind the attractive “high profits” claimed by brokers, there are often great risks or even traps.

&amp;#x200B;

As one of the victims suffering such broker scams, Mr. Wang reported GPAK to WikiFX and shared his experience of being defrauded to warn other investors against the illegal Forex broker.

&amp;#x200B;

Complainant: Mr. Wang

Forex broker: GPAK

Broker website: http://www.gpakcn.com/

Time of opening account: February, 2019

Time of withdrawal: June 20th, 2019

Withdrawal status: in process

Customer service: no response

Website status: inaccessible

&amp;#x200B;

**Event Recap**

I opened an account on GPAK in February, 2019 under the recommendation of a friend and made 2 deposits through Alipay. From February to June, I managed to make some profits which added up with the initial deposit to US$3,503.62.

I once contacted the customer service in April to withdraw, but was advised to wait, as he claimed my request won't be processed during the May Day holiday. On June 20th, I was informed that my application had been approved. But strangely enough, my trading account showed the application remained in process and I still didnt receive the money a week later. When I tried to log in my GPAK account, I found the website was no longer accessible and the customer service didn't reply any more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Case Study**

First persuade investors to deposit through “acquaintance's recommendation” , and then postpone their withdrawal applications to prepare for escaping, which is an old trick of illegal brokers.

In Mr. Wang's case, GPAK first got Mr. Wang to deposit through the marketing strategy of “acquaintance's recommendation” and further lured him into making more investments with attractive profits. When Mr. Wang tried to withdraw, the customer service began to pull up all kinds of excuses such as withdrawal can't be processed during the holiday in order to postpone withdrawal and perhaps win themselves more time for running away.

&amp;#x200B;

**Case Summary**

As more Forex scams have been exposed, the illegal brokers also become more sophisticated in their tricks. We conclude the following tips based on Mr. Wang's case:

1. Investors should always check a broker's qualification and stay prudent about the recommendations of others, even from your friends.

2. Think twice when you seem to be profiting and want to double down your deposit, as no investment comes without risks.

3. Asset safety should always be your priority. Only deposits made through UnionPay or in escrow are under the regulation of the People's Bank of China, and there's still a chance of getting the money back even if you' re defrauded. However, if the deposit is made through Alipay, WeChat Pay or personal transfer, investors risk suffering great loss.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

According to the information on WikiFX App, the licenses from FCA(UK) and NFA(US) which GPAK claims to hold are suspected to be cloned, while its AR license from FCA(UK) has been revoked. Currently without valid regulatory status, the broker is rated at only 1.93 on the WikiFX App and bears significant risks, please stay away from it."
10,2019-07-13,bolyus21,1,Mapping Out Some Collateral Developments to Blockchain Technology,"Guest Blogger: *Andrew Rossow, Esq.*

Every once and while, a new technology comes around that positively impacts innovation in several fields, even some outside of its initially intended sector. Blockchains, more specifically Bitcoin, is increasingly showing the signs of doing the very same.

From the expansion and further development of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) (ZKPs) to [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#can-snarks-and-starks-help), a seemingly golden age of cryptography, improved privacy, and permissionless financial products have branched out from Bitcoin’s meteoric rise.

ZKPs and a New Era of Privacy

Obviously central to the name “cryptocurrencies,” is the cryptography component that underpins Bitcoin’s transaction scheme and that of the many altcoins. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, which is becoming increasingly clear with the likes of blockchain forensics companies emerging left and right — attracting government support in the process.

However, that realization has led to some fascinating downstream effects in the development of better cryptography.

For example, research into a full-scale implementation of Schnorr Signatures, widely considered to be the best cryptographic signature primitive, [recently materialized](https://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-releases-test-code-for-bitcoin-tech-upgrade-schnorr) into a formal proposal for inclusion into Bitcoin. Dubbed, “MuSig,” Schnorr Signatures would confer better scalability and privacy to the legacy cryptocurrency.

But the innovation does not stop there.

Out of the demand for anonymity came altcoins like Monero and ZCash, predicated on novel cryptographic techniques for completely masking the identities of users and the amounts transferred.

For example, Monero, a “CryptoNote Coin,” leverages the power of ring signatures — a technique for obfuscating the originator of a signed digital message that has been around for years but never applied on the scale as it is with Monero.

Researchers even released a new implementation of formalized ring signatures for enhanced privacy, called [OmniRing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/buumwj/omniring_scaling_up_private_payments_without/), designed to scale up privacy transactions without the feared “trusted setup.” Similarly, the production of “[Bulletproofs](https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/)” out of the famed Stanford Applied Cryptography Group enhanced the efficiency of privacy-preserving transactions, which have historically been data-heavy.

The concept builds on the notion of ZKPs, which have attracted the nickname of “crypto magic” for being unfathomably complex from a mathematical perspective while furnishing near-complete anonymity.

All of these developments, while built on technologies preceding Bitcoin, have accelerated over the last few years. Even banks, like JP Morgan, are joining in on the fun, building their own implementations of ZKPs for private transactions.

The snowballing innovation in the field of cryptography comes at an opportune time. Once hailed by cypherpunks as the [last vestige of hope](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/) against a surveillance state, cryptography is a powerful shield against the repeated data malpractice of tech firms and government snooping.

What began as an era of openly sharing on social media platforms, has spun into a complicated mix of wanting social media but without corporations and governments having access to the data — privacy is now at a premium.

Distributed Computing — Scaling Decentralized Networks

Similar to the rise in cryptography over the last several years, there has been an explosion in distributed computing, particularly scaling decentralized networks. Emerging out of the need for public, permissionless blockchain networks (i.e., Ethereum) to scale better, a confluence of efficiency improvements and innovative technologies are seeking to power public blockchains with the same performance level as their centralized counterparts.

For example, the concept of *sharding* — horizontally partitioning a database — has gained prominence among several platforms, including Ethereum, as a way to enable groups (i.e., shards) of nodes process transactions in parallel. Ethereum’s foray into sharding is known as its Serenity upgrade, which is pending rollout following more extensive research and testing of the underlying concept.

Other projects, like [Elrond](https://elrond.com/), are pushing the envelope even farther. Elrond is working on a bleeding-edge form of state sharding known as “Adaptive State Sharding” in conjunction with their secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Compared to the other forms of sharding, transaction and network, state sharding is the most technically complex and widely considered to have enormous potential in boosting the performance of public blockchains. Elrond implements all three in an ambitious take on scaling decentralized networks.

Take the case of Elrond, whose [Testnet](https://testnet.elrond.com/#/) is already live, and has reached a peak performance capacity of nearly 12,000 transactions per second (TPS). For context, Ethereum’s current iteration process roughly 15 – 20 TPS.

Sharding, similar to the aforementioned privacy technologies, is not a new concept either. Sharding is prevalent for improving database efficiency and has been around for many years. It is only recently that it began garnering attention in crypto circles as a method to improve the scalability of decentralized networks.

The sheer scale of development of sharding applied to distributed networks is nothing short of impressive so far.

The convergence of technologies like sharding with new consensus designs, like PoS, is sure to usher in a new generation of blockchains, supplemented by better privacy and scalability. It is not surprising that such developments have flown under the radar, as they are highly esoteric, but their downstream advantages for mainstream consumers and app users are promising.

Bitcoin may have birthed a spectacular invention of money, but its collateral effects in the form of distributed computing and cryptography may come to have a more dynamic impact on society than a P2P digital currency.

11,2019-07-03,Johannahojjohan,0,Your opinion please,"He guys and girls, i have something to share. I do it here since you are all into crypto.
A bunch of Stanford students started a few months ago with the Pi Network project. The app went live on 3-14 and there ar 90.000 engaged users so far. www minepi com
Their goal is to divide their coins as widely as possible to give everyone a fair change of getting in. 
You gather them by joining and it goes faster when you contribute to expanding the community.
You can download the app from the app store and soon on Google Play as well. Since you need a referrer you can use ""Koekeloeris"" if you like it.
The goal is to have a global marketplace running at the end of the year. That's when they will also hit the exchanges and you can trade the coins you gathered.
Hope to see you in the in app chat someday :-) Thanks for reading, Johan."

The whole article seems fishy to me in its wording and you can view it here:
