0,2020-01-31,statscsfanatic21,1,Does reading the daily newspapers actually help in investing?,"I have done my due research, and contemplated posting this in the advice thread, but this seems slightly different, hence posting it as a standalone post.

My question is if reading the newspapers actually help in investing. I currently have a subscription to FT, that I bought at the start of the year, but I feel like the insights I have gathered so far are minimal, and there just aren't that many world developments on a day to day basis to warrant reading every day.

For instance,

1) Wuhan coronavirus is spreading day by day

2) Apple's performing well above expectations due to above-average sales of the iPhone

3) Tesla's stock price skyrocketed these couple of days due to public confidence of the Tesla models

and Boeing, Nissan news, Huawei's 5G role in UK infrastructure, Trump impeachment etc. etc.

I do understand that the macroeconomy is diverse, and there are definitely spillover effects into sectors, but I'm wondering if there are better publications out there that can actually help me learn investing and put matters in a slightly more investing-centric context. For instance, I'm thinking Barron's even though I have never read it before, since it seems to be highly recommended.

My situation is that I'm 24 with around $40K USD, and I have decided to take investing more seriously this year, and invest in stocks. Probably gonna start with index funds first, but would like to slowly make my way up to picking stocks and investing (and reinvesting dividends etc), basically being a passive investor. 

A separate question is, should I also learn more about finance in general? Investing seems to be more economics-focused, so I was thinking that reading more about finance in general would help me understand businesses better when doing research, and just improving my financial literacy would help as well."
1,2020-01-29,street-guru,1,Several valid concerns from AAPL's strong F'Q1,"$AAPL F'Q1 results were undeniably strong, beating expectations on revenue, margins, EPS, and more importantly F'Q2 guidance despite concerns regarding the impact from the coronavirus (China sales actually returned to growth).

However, there are several valid concerns and less positive data points, too.

1. stronger than expected demand for iPhone 11 could lead to a more modest than expected 5G iPhone cycle as consumers don't seem to be waiting to upgrade.
2. services growth (often touted to justify AAPL's premium multiple) slowed to 17% y/y vs. 20% y/y last quarter.
3. AAPL already closed a store in Wuhan and traffic appears light in several Chinese cities. F'Q2 guidance beat, but still could see a $4B swing in revenues from the coronavirus outbreak.
4. the stock has moved pretty much vertically upwards lately.

In short, the stock seems ripe for some profit-taking near term.

But looking beyond the near term noise, AAPL's long-term fundamentals clearly continued to strengthen as the company broadens its ramp for consumers to get into the Apple ecosystem lock-in. For instance, active AAPL devices grew 7% to 1.5B devices, and subscribers were up 120m y/y to 480m on Dec 31, 2019, which is 9 months ahead of plan.

The near term noise may be sounding a growing sell signal, but timing the market has never been easy. If the stock is a good one long-term, better to just look through the noise and stick with it until the fundamentals no longer justify it."

4,2020-01-23,istockusername,1,Diversification through fractional shares,"I had a thought yesterday but I’m not sure if it makes sense.

Due to the possibilities of fractional shares and free trading wouldn't it make sense to create little indexes for yourself instead of picking just a few invidual stocks? I think this would be best for small investors that want to have diversified portfolio, limited budget and want to bet/invest on trends that might outperform for example the S&amp;P 500. Assuming that most ""Investor"" don't know the exact numbers behind every company it would also take out the risk kf picking the ""wrong"" stock.  

For example we all know 5G and IoT are supposed to be the next big thing. As far as I know there is no index on stocks that will benefit from 5G, so technically you could invest $1k into 20 biggest companies in that sector and each company have a 5% share. With to the fractional shares you could include stocks with a higher share price."
5,2020-01-21,how_you_feel,1,What are your views on getting in on the 5G train in 2020?,"With 5G hanging around, 2020 is being touted as the year of 5G: https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-that-will-change-your-life-in-2020

&gt; Just a few weeks ago, T-Mobile began to roll out its low-band 5G network, which stretches beyond street corners and into the great indoors, unlike the higher-band networks, but isn’t as fast. AT&amp;T is set to do the same in early 2020. Verizon’s plans to blanket the U.S. with super-duper-fast 5G are less clear but it’s been lighting up cities in the double digits over the last few weeks. Sprint has turned on its midband 5G in some cities, which isn’t as fast but travels longer distances and works indoors. New phones from Samsung, Motorola and even Apple with chips from Qualcomm are expected to support all the flavors of 5G. We’ll also begin hearing about how much more these 5G plans will cost us."
6,2020-01-18,webbersmak,1,Juicy Juniper,"Juniper Networks hit my radar last week and I opened a small position. [Looking](https://stockarmor.com/jnpr.pdf) at the numbers, this is a solid find. Nice, thick operation margin. Current assets are plump and cover liabilities 2x over.  You'll the notice the operating cash flow ratio is a little low, but looking deeper, a chunk of the current liabilities are in the form of deferred revenue (customer prepayments). Their TIE ratio of 5+ clearly indicates they can handle their debt payments. 

The other thing I'm happy to see is the plentiful number of open positions on their careers page - a strong indicator of growth. The rollout of 5G may even provide additional tailwinds.

If you wanted an alternative to a large mega tech like Cisco in your portfolio. This is it."

8,2020-01-17,street-guru,1,"Analyst checks indicate no delays to 5G mmWave ""iPhone 12"", contrary to rumors","$AAPL Apple is widely believed to have made a design change to the 5G mmWave module for the next-gen iPhone. Analyst checks in Asia suggest Apple has moved away from a turnkey Qualcomm antenna-in-package (AIP) solution that would have added \~$50 to iPhone 12's bill of materials (BOM), to one Apple designed on its own though still using Qualcomm components. This move is expected to save \~$30 on the mmWave iPhone's BOM.

More importantly, suppliers checks detected no production delays as a result of this design change, and a July production start is expected for all versions of the ""iPhone 12"". The latest supplier checks also suggest that the mix of 5G models for iPhone 12 has increased to 70% from 40%, in order to stay competitive in markets where 5G infrastructure is already in place (e.g. China) or just getting started (e.g. US, Japan). 

The lower addition to the iPhone's BOM for the mmWave 5G model ($20 v.s. $50) is great news for Apple because it will be much easier for Apple to absorb the cost and would represents a notable cost advantage over most competitors who are using Qualcomm's $50 turnkey solution."
9,2020-01-16,DemonXeno,1,[Question] Which phone service is most popular in Asia?,"Hi, I want to invest in 5G as much as I can before it becomes widely available to hopefully make a little money on it.

Thank you!"
10,2020-01-12,mrongo,1,very new to active management in my own portfolio - seeking stock advice in choosing between two growth stocks,"I am currently mulling between the following companies (but also am keeping my mind open in the semiconductor industry):

\- Qualcomm (QCOM) - ˜$90 per share, $103b market cap, 25 p/e, 46% F1 EPS growth, 322% debt to equity  
\- Universal Display Corp (OLED) - ˜$216 per share, $10b market cap, 78 p/e, 31% F1 EPS growth, essentially  $0 in debt

I'm leading towards Qualcomm due to their 5G growth and value on earnings. Are there any metrics I'm missing? I know there isn't a 100% guaranteed system but I'm attempting to make more informed decisions on growth stocks rather than sacrificing some of that growth by letting funds/ETFs do the work for me."
11,2020-01-09,nothrowaway4me,1,Struggling to see why 5G is viewed as a big catalyst for Apple (and other phone makers),"One of the biggest things that's being talked about when it comes to Apple is how the 5G supercycle will supercharge earnings and get the Iphone to be a top performer but I am struggling to understand that thesis. 


5G is no doubt coming, but the companies benefiting from the adoption of 5G will likely be those who are building the technology itself and the infrastructure. I see 5G as a tailwind for Nokia, AMT, Ericsson, Verizon etc. 



I don't think there are many customers out there who want an Iphone, can afford to get one, but are holding out for 5G? The top priorities of smartphone buyers camera performance, battery and new software features. I can't imagine most people are even aware of what 5G really is"
12,2020-01-09,ichi-zero,1,"Big ""data"" is the new ""oil"" - Trend Investing","Here's a phrase I've heard ""Data is the new oil..and king"" - Partially correct.

""Data is the new CURRENCY and those with the most USEFUL data and ability to REFINE new data is KING"" -There you go - fixed. 

There are various types of ""data""

=&gt; Bulk ""data"" for data's sake (NSA Prism)

=&gt; ""processable data"" (Telemetry data collected from end-consumers)

=&gt; ""usable data"" (Filtered data w/ noise removed)

This conclusion I've arrived at is similar to John D. Rockefeller's during the age of OIL - he realized refining oil (processing data) is a more stable business than mining for oil (data). EVERYONE can mine data now, but it's mostly useless unless it's refined to show relevant data.

A better play for the future imo is data storage and AI that will be processing these mountains of data (e.g. Micron, Western Digital, Seagate, Microsoft, Google).

If you look at data creation projection for the next 5 years - it's unprecedented. Furthered by the age of digital content streaming and creation- Youtube, Netflix, Disney+, Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime TV.

Prime example: Google's Stadia is far from a flop - it was rushed to market just before Xmas not for sales - but for consumer awareness - and gives Google time to implement fixes and stabilize their game stream infrastructure just AS 5G/Wifi 6 is being rolled out and adopted - with significantly lower latency - comparable to a wired connection; the massive bandwidth increase is almost secondary.

Again, all this data - (cold storage, backup, fluid data, etc) all needs to be processed and storage SOMEHOW.

PS: All puns were refined and processed as intended."
13,2020-01-02,Sportsman18,1,My Stock pickings for 2020 (Degiro),"Hi guys, I'll share with you my chooses for my wallet to hold for more than 20years. I'll start buy from this month ahead.

European:

* EDPR (PSI-20)
* Ibersol (PSI-20)
* GAMESA (IBEX 35)
* ACCIONA (IBEX 35)
* CAF (IBEX 35)

International:

* KO (NYSE)
* SBUX (NYSE)
* MSFT (NYSE)
* ACB (TSE)
* VZ (NYSE)

ETF's:

* VUSA (EAM)
* NHI (NSY)

 Each company was analyzed in the 'Financial report' (Revenue, Net Income, EBIT, EBITDA, P/E, Cash Flow, Debt and EPS), latest news and market performance over the past 5 years. 

 Without going into too much detail:  

***Energy Sector (EDPR, GAMESA):*** It is a sector where companies are gradually starting to focus on renewable energy and something that I believe in the long run will be very positive.  

***Telecommunication Sector (NOS, VZ):*** The main reason that led me to choose these was the upcoming 5G technology that will drive revenue.  

***Beverage &amp; Entertainment Sector (KO, SBUX, IBS):*** KO is a very solid company and recently acquired Costa Coffee (I think it will increase its revenues in the long run), SBUX is a strong company that has been showing good results.  

***Construction Sector (ACCIONA, CAF):*** Both companies have good results and good prospects in the future. They are present in various forms (trains, meters, highways, energy etc ..) in various countries around the world.  

***Technology Sector (MSFT)***: For now I chose Microsoft because besides being a solid company, has been showing good results and recently joined the blockchain (in Azure). Keeping an eye on AMD.  

***Pharmaceuticals Sector (ACB):*** This is an area that I believe will bring value to the care of certain diseases. 

In ETFs, I chose NHI because it is a well composed and with good volume (24H) and VUSA because it comes with the S &amp; P500  

\--***Possible crisis 2020?*** \--

Maybe, maybe not, who knows? What is known is that in the long run (+20 years) it will not make much difference.

***WARNING:***

This is NOT a advice on what to buy, I just did my research and according to my profile. 

I'm a first-trip guy I'm willing to risk beyond comfort. ***Open to suggestions and opinions.***   
 

Good year and good investments to all!!"

17,2020-02-18,QS_Beeky,1,What do you think about investing in companies that manufacture / install fiber optic cables?,"5G internet... from my research, 5G doesn't work without fiber optics. Copper coaxial cables cannot support the full benefits of 5G. I think (and want some feedback) that investing in these kinds of companies will reap rewards a few years down the line as 5G starts coming out. I don't want to invest in Verizon/AT&amp;T because they just need to have it installed and will supply it but the real money, in my opinion, is in the manufacturers and installers of fiber optics.   


Additionally 5G range is significantly shorter than 4G so more towers will need to be built to support 5G. companies that build telecommunication towers are probably a good investment for the near future as well.  


Would love some feedback based on my research"

Given the Huawei ban by the US and allies, its market share relative to other 5g providers (Nokia's had problems in Korea for example), and the lack of big American 5G providers leading to potential big US investment, is Ericsson currently undervalued following the slump due to the $1.2bn corruption fines?

21,2020-02-13,carndacier,1,Beginner - am I doing that right ?,"hey guys,

I recently (yesterday) started my investment journey, bought my first shares from $XIC, for a long term revenue, and would like to buy some companies stocks, for more like a ""swing"" investment type.

&amp;#x200B;

What I do when I research a company, is :

 \- Check the share price : as I only have +- 1500$ to invest, I look for &lt; 50$ shares

 \- Open the investor relation website : check their income / debt / assets / liabilities

 \- Check their dividends : if they grew, been always given for the past years

 \- then... I feel like I know enough, so check what other people think of the stock...

 \-  ... and feel like I've done shit researches !

&amp;#x200B;

What am I missing ? What do you guys look for when you decide to buy shares ? Do you have a recent example of an investment you've made and why you decided to jump in ?

&amp;#x200B;

As for a personnal example : I was looking at CISCO. Their income recently went down, so has their stock price. but, with 5g coming, a bit more service income, stable dividends, and overall stock growth for the past years, I felt it would be a good investment in a stable company ?

But lot of people say competitors are rising and CISCO will ""fall""...

27,2020-03-24,street-guru,1,"$AAPL: big cuts to 1H estimates, recovery expected in the fall","As expected, the street is continuing to trim estimates for the Mar and Jun quarters due to the impact of COVID-19. This time the cuts are much bigger (13-15% cut for Mar quarter, 15-20% cut for Jun quarter) now that there is greater visibility to the supply chain disruptions in China for much of the Mar quarter, as well as the demand pressures in China for most of the Mar quarter spreading to the rest of the world starting late Feb.

Analyst checks on global smartphone shipment data indicate a 38% y/y decline for Feb, which is the largest decline ever. Expectation now is that the demand pressures will persist in North America (US \~45% of sales) and Europe (\~25% of sales) for most of the Jun quarter as China begins to slowly recover. While Macs and iPads should arguably do better than iPhones in this environment of learn/work from home, technology purchases in general are currently far from consumers' top of mind.

All the bad news near term aside, the long-term bull thesis for AAPL remains intact. AAPL has \~$100bn in net cash, generated \~$64b in free cash LTM, and has \~20x interest coverage ratio - it is as safe as any company can be in weathering this pandemic, not to mention its flexibility for buybacks. Since AAPL is expected to launch its 5G iPhones in the fall, it should be less hurt than other makers already on the market today. Prior to this crisis, AAPL was forecast to capture \~25% of the 5G handset market in 2020. Demand for AAPL devices should start to see a nice recovery in the fall."

29,2020-03-16,street-guru,1,Sizing up $AAPL store closure impact,"AAPL has closed all of its retail stores outside of China, and at the same time reopened all its 52 stores in China. This implies \~90% of AAPL's 510 stores globally will be impacted until further notice.

Assuming \~$16m of retail sales per store in Q2, 13 weeks in the quarter, and retail sales representing \~12% of total revenue, 2 weeks of store closures outside China will impact AAPL sales by \~$1bn, or 1.5-2% of Q2 revenues.

With the situation in Europe and here in the US changing by the hour, store closures could extend beyond 2 weeks. The bigger medium term risk is a wider recession hurting consumer spending. Excitement for the 5G iPhone cycle should be put in context of a potentially deeper recession, during which such a discretionary purchase can be postponed. So while the stock is down another 7.5% this morning (-21% from recent peak), there may be a better buying opportunity ahead yet."

35,2020-04-15,street-guru,3,$AAPL - some early data on App Store trends through COVID,"According to checks by Morgan Stanely this week, app downloads in the Mar quarter is up \~25% y/y (strongest since 2015) likely helped by stay-at-home measures against COVID-19. However, consumers also appear to be less willing to spend on the incremental apps, with revenue per download down \~5% y/y.

Interestingly, China appears to be leading the slowdown in the net revenue per download, with its net revenue growth slowing from 32% in Jan, to 14% in Feb, and 3% in Mar, even as download volume increased 30% y/y for the quarter. China's App Store's net revenue per download is down 11% y/y, a sharp reversal from the 32% y/y growth in the Dec quarter. Outside of China, the rest of the world performed well, with net revenue growth accelerating to 20% y/y in the Mar quarter, compared to 18% in the Dec quarter.

Overall, Service revenue appears set to beat for the Mar quarter. But since China had nearly a full quarter of the COVID-19 impact, it could be an early indicator of the App Store's softer performance for rest of world in the Jun quarter. In any event, the likely bigger drivers for the stock will continue to be COVID's potential impact (or lack thereof) on product timing (i.e. 5G iPhone cycle) and consumer demand."

To what extent do you think this is going to be revolutionary and across the globe and what do you guys think there is small companies working on 5g technologies that are well managed, and could have future interesting growth ?"
37,2020-04-14,quantumfome,0,Opportunities in 5G (RESN) amid Corona,"Here are some points taken directly from the most recent quarterly conference call. 

""Resonant resolves critical RF problems by providing differentiated solutions for the largest segment of the RF front-end market. We leverage our proprietary software platform, our deep portfolio of intellectual property and our seasoned team to deliver solutions that our partners and customers could not do themselves with greater efficiency and at lower cost and with a reduced time to market.

So how do we do this? We believe Resonant has developed unparalleled and disruptive technology. Our revolutionary and proprietary Infinite Synthesized Network or ISN software platform enables the development of high-performance, low-cost designs and, in many cases, resulting in as much as 3 to 5x faster design development. Most notably, our novel and innovative XBAR Bulk Acoustic Wave or BAW resonator structures are targeting the exacting requirements of 5G and WiFi 6.

On the business front, we have a diversified growth platform with licensing revenue streams from both our ISN-enabled 4G filter solutions and breakout royalty growth from our XBAR solutions. Our future includes other high-frequency-enabled 5G products, which I'll discuss in more detail later in the call. Our foundry program directly enables new entrants to rapidly address the changing needs of the China market.

Now let's discuss 2019. We've set the stage with huge successes based on our technology and business model. On the technology front, we demonstrated the first working XBAR 5G filters with 10% bandwidth and high-power handling at Mobile World Congress in 2019. We signed a strategic investment and commercial agreement totaling $16 million with the world's largest RF filter manufacturer, targeting production of mobile phone filters in the 2021 and '22 time frame. This agreement was the first of what we expect will be many license agreements with prepaid royalties. We are targeting to deliver the first nonmobile samples based on XBAR in the first half of this year.

On the business front, in the first half of 2019, our customers shipped over 1.5 million units. In just the third quarter of 2019, they again shipped over 1.5 million units. And in the fourth quarter, we met our expectation with over 2.25 million units, bringing the total units shipped to date to over 35 million units since we started in 2016. In addition, in February, we significantly strengthened our cash position through a public offering yielding $26.3 million in net proceeds.

As we entered 2020, COVID-19, or as is more commonly known, the coronavirus, has had a clear impact on the overall market, where many of our customers and partners have already lowered their first half forecasts. One of our peers even reduced their quarterly forecast as much as 50%. At Resonant, we continue to expect to see revenues grow quarter-over-quarter from Q4 2019 to Q1 2020. More on that later from Marty.

We're using this time of market uncertainty to evaluate our existing customers, focusing the company on -- company's resources on our strongest customers, including those with prepayments as well as transitioning our foundry customers to our new Tier 1 foundry partners in China with lower cost to help them -- make them more competitive.

I'd like to spend a little time on the cornerstone that fuels the -- our opportunities in growth. Our Infinite Synthesized Networks or ISN software platform, as I mentioned earlier, revolutionizes filter design as it enables low-cost filter fabrication with superior performance and faster time to market. To the best of our knowledge, ISN is the only RF filter design platform that delivers an integrated end-to-end multidimensional acoustic and electromagnetic modeling capability that allows designers to innovate quickly and virtually in real time. We do this by simulation versus the industry standard iteration process that can and does take multiple turns, which is disruptive and costly to the manufacturing process and extends development time. Most importantly, ISN delivers designs across the entire wireless spectrum.

Let me highlight that it is our game-changing XBAR technology that will be the platform for our future, building on the engagements, learnings and intellectual property from the past. XBAR is our revolutionary Bulk Acoustic Wave or BAW resonator structure, which was designed with ISN and is produced using standard manufacturing processes, which means it leverages standard SAW and MEMS manufacturing processes to deliver a BAW structure, which is a novel, low-cost approach for meeting these new technology requirements. It is important to highlight that XBAR was designed specifically to meet the exacting standards of 5G and WiFi coexistence, in particular, the demand for bandwidth and high power. XBAR has shown the ability to allow cellular and WiFi networks in adjacent frequency bands to mitigate interference problems.

""Allow me to present an analogy we've used in the past to illustrate the coexistence issues. It's like driving down the highway. Filters are what keep cars or signals in the right lanes or in the right data path. 5G creates new challenges as neighboring cars, i.e., WiFi, is right next to you, crowding your lane and sometimes even entering your lane, stopping your path or even causing a crash or collision. XBAR -- Resonant's XBAR filters are simply better barriers between the lanes of the highway, keeping those adjacent cars or signals where they're supposed to be. And let's not forget that XBAR was built on our foundational intellectual property over 200 patents with greater than 50 patents specifically focused on 5G.

We have multiple diversified revenue streams targeting high-growth markets of both 4G and 5G. We first began generating licensing revenue on a per unit basis for custom filter designs. We expanded our offering to include filter IP standard library-based designs available through our foundry program to shorten time to market. In 2019, we added prepaid royalties to our cutting-edge XBAR technologies. And in 2020, we added license agreements targeting the China market for existing 4G applications that included prepaid royalties and additional royalties once minimum unit volumes are exceeded. Finally, we expect to get white label sales from our foundry supply chain through engagements that could start as soon as later in 2020.""

Let's discuss what everyone is focused on, 5G. An increased number of filters, more complex filters are required for 5G's high frequencies. 4G phones currently require about 60 filters, whereas 5G phones are expected to require more than 100 filters. Our proprietary IDT membrane resonator technology enables our XBAR family of solutions. XBAR has already been contracted by the world's largest RF filter manufacturer for use in mobile. Additionally, we are engaged with other industry leaders for high-bandwidth, high-power 5G applications for a wide variety of industries outside of mobile, such as WiFi, CPE and infrastructure. We are targeting delivery of these first nonmobile samples based on our XBAR technology in the first half of this year.

The first wave of 5G is here. The focus of initial deployments is drive down carrier's cost of data delivery, leveraging refarm 4G with a move to higher frequency and higher bandwidth in the mid-band, which is 2.5 to 4.2 gigahertz in the U.S. and up to 5 gigahertz globally starting in 2021. This timing puts our agreement with the world's largest filter manufacturer in the sweet spot as they are poised to enter the market with our technology right as the market takes off. And with our recently announced 5 gigahertz and 6 gigahertz WiFi bandpass filters, we are positioned to deliver the next round of Tier 1 engagements. For those of you who want to learn more, we have published a white paper that goes into further detail that can be found on our website.

Let's talk about the 4G market, which is the dominant filter market today is not going away anytime soon as 4G filters will be refarmed for 5G technology and the 4G network will provide a backstop for 5G coverage holes. As the market continues to commoditize, we look at ways to further improve time to market and help our partners compete more effectively. As a result, we have recently partnered with a Tier 1 Chinese foundry, leveraging our filter IP standard library and capitalizing on our ISN tools and services to deliver solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner, specifically targeting the China market. Prepaid royalties are expected to be dominant in our revenue stream for 2020, complemented by royalty unit volumes from existing contracts.

As noted, 4G is expected to remain with us for many years. ASPs have declined rapidly since the initiation of many of our agreements for filter designs, and specifications continue to get more challenging. As a result, there has been more rapid shift in customer interest to products based on our filter IP standard library that capitalize on the strength of our ISN platform and our ability to design standard products that can be easily ported between foundries. We already have initial contracts signed with a Tier 1 component and foundry player, which include prepaid royalties. While our customers' demand throughout 2019 had a solid trajectory entering 2020, we are cautiously optimistic given the current state of the global market that we will continue to see growth in this throughout 2020. We will focus on performing customers to ensure we continue to get the value out of our investments.

Turning to Slide 13. Our foundry program provides our current fabless customers with alternative access to a stable and experienced supply chain for the 4G market. We signed a Tier 1 Chinese foundry partner in January of 2020, complementing our existing Chinese foundry relationships. Those foundries have the potential to enable market participants at a scale to compete with today's dominant suppliers and have the potential to further reduce the cost of the RF front-end for existing technologies.

I'd like to highlight 2 achievements that clearly show our noticeable traction in the market and accelerating momentum. First, in 2019, the world's largest RF filter manufacturer entered into a $9 million commercial agreement with us for the rights to develop multiple designs using our XBAR technology targeting the mobile market. Upon signing the commercial agreement, they also made a $7 million strategic investment in us. The second achievement occurred in January of 2020 when a Tier 1 Chinese foundry signed multiple license agreements for prepaid royalties and upfront payments, with the potential for additional royalties once the minimum volumes were exceeded. This customer also licensed our Process Monitoring Tool or PMTx to aid in its manufacturing processes.

Before I turn the call over to Marty, I'd like to discuss our expanded management team. In December of 2019, we announced that Dylan Kelly joined Resonant in a newly created Chief Operating Officer role. He is responsible for our engineering, product marketing and operations functions. His extensive semiconductor business expertise and professional network across a broad range of areas, including smartphones, wireless infrastructure and test and measurement, are natural fit for this new role.

Resonant has never been in a better position to deliver growth for its customers, employees and shareholders. We have a strong balance sheet buoyed by the recent proceeds from our February 2020 public offering. We are targeting the largest segment of the rapidly growing market, RF filters, which are expected to nearly double to $28 billion by 2025. We have a robust technology and IP portfolio of over 200 patents filed or issued, with more than 50 targeted for high-frequency 5G devices. And we've demonstrated and contracted XBAR-based filter designs, the first RF filters that can meet the high bandwidth requirements of 5G. Our partnership with the world's largest RF filter manufacturer and strong traction with our other existing customers are proven validation of our technology. And our foundry program will further expand our customer base by allowing component suppliers ease of entry at low cost. Leading all of this is our proven management team.  new technologies that we've developed specifically for WiFi both in the 5 and 6 gigahertz range.""

I'm eyeing at Nokia and Ericsson as these two European companies both have contracts signed with T-mobile, Verizon and At&amp;t. In the 5G race, Nokia Ericsson and Huawei are the leading companies but since Huawei is ruled out in the US market for security reason, which makes Nokia and Ericsson become the only candidates left. I've also looked at 5G chipmakers like Qualcomn. I believe once 5G becomes popular, the licensing will become a huge source of income for the companies I mentioned above.

Now that everyone is looking at the pandemic and it's impact, but 5G is definitely inevitable with a launch of hopefully end of this year.

First it was problems with high-end smartphones, then it was iPhone, then they made a stupid purchase (Here maps), problems with the application store (Ovi), problems with Symbian/Meego. 
  
Now it is most apparently problems with 5G. The stock is really cheap (2,76€ per Share) and why wouldn't it be?

Nokia's all time high was 65€, thus

The percentage change from 65 to 2.76 is -95.75 %. 

Are there any examples of a company that has Lost 95% of its value and made a significant comeback?

Moreover, for me it is hard to believe that Nokia can start paying any notable dividends for many years. But what I believe are the strong fluctuations in the stock price (might go up 10-20% in a short time), the only thing needed is a first real good piece of news and the stock could high likely bounce up.

What do you think?"

We have never seen a time like this ever and comparing versus 2008 or another crash/recession/depression is not a useful measure.  This time is different cause we are being jailed by the virus, and that has largely stopped all progress (e.g. 5g, Tesla, autonomous driving, travel, retail, sports, theaters) and the life as we knew it in 2019.  Resources are being diverted to fight a pandemic and health crisis, but the fight is straining consumers/workers, businesses, and state and sovereign govts worldwide.  The dominoes that fall with credit defaults, bankruptcies, tremendous unemployment, real estate (both resi and commercial).  Everything is being supported by our government which is stepping in to prop things up.  How long can that last for before the game is over?  It is a real possibility that the financial and economic impact of this will cause markets to crash (to the tune of 50-80% lower from these levels).  The only thing that will save us and turn the tide is a vaccine or better testing that can help us to have confidence being out and about.  Until that happens, I am afraid that we won’t see a return to normalcy and life like we knew it in 2019.  

Yes, we will adapt and we can recover from a reset.  Business and life can go on even when the virus risk is still around.  But that new world is different.  Be safe and thank our heroes helping us through these extraordinary times."
43,2020-04-03,3STmotivation,1,Portfolio consisting of 50% tech stocks (pros and cons discussion),"With all the talk of 5G, IoT, AI and new software dominating the markets for the next decade, would it be a mistake to build a portfolio that for 50% consists of stocks in the tech field or would it be the best move in order to try and get the most returns?

Examples of the tech stocks I am referring to:
Alphabet... Microsoft... Apple... Nvidea... Honeywell... Qualcomm... Intel... Facebook... Baidu... AMD... Micron...

The risk should be obvious, with so many companies in the same sector it makes a portfolio incredibly vulnerable to a sudden collapse. Another risk is the fact that most of these companies are competing with each other on one or multiple fronts, which means that not all of them can come out on top and give the return on investment so many are hoping for.

The upsides are just as obvious though, the tech sector is growing at an incredible rate and the development of new technologies will continue to become a bigger and bigger part of the every day life of people.

Satellite won't be viable for many high tech workers accessing large amounts of data. 4g/5g could be a good alternative, but I believe VZ and ATT are too old school to catch on until it's too late. Outside of TMOB what are some that might hit on this early on?

Where will we go?,"Hello everybody, I want to start of by telling you that this is a really long post and I don't expect anyone to take from their personal time to read it. With that being said the structure is at follows - a short summary is the first thing that you will read. You can find the arguments in the body of the post if you are curious. Thank you for your attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Why we won't see a new low in the stock market
* Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction
* How to **not** make a buying decision
* Why covid is not that horrible

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Why we won't see a new low in the stock market**

Will start of by saying that comparing this crisis with 08/09 doesn't work due to the key difference of the core problem. In 08/09 it was a core problem of the financial system, now its a virus. The business were working just fine before covid.

We will not see a new low due to a platitude of reasons. We have the Fed which backstops everything, we have unemployed people getting more money now than when they were working and basing on recent examples we also have a lot of people that can't wait to go out and do stuff. See Disney park in Shanghai being instantly sold out. See Carnival cruises getting booked like crazy and a plethora of other examples where we see people don't care about covid.

The market is driven by the Tech companies right now which we see that are doing really good in this environment.  The slow and steady re-opening will bring business to every other company affected. This is a strong argument for the stock market to go up. Gas will be needed for cars so companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell will see their demands go higher, pushing the oil price higher and therefore the revenue will be higher.

We will see a bounce back for companies like Realty Income or Simon property Group once people will slowly start to use gyms, go to the malls, getting their jobs back and brining back the normal flow for rent payments.

We will see companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T push higher due to 5G implementation.

We are already seeing healthcare companies going higher and higher based on the situation. A lot of them will start going back down but the big dogs will stay where they are or will push higher.

And so on.. every single industry has strong arguments to go higher and higher by slowly re-opening the country and things normalizing.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction**

&amp;#x200B;

Here we need to talk about the elephant in the room, covid. The first and the most obvious reason would be covid doing a spanish flu style rebound and start being a real killer. This is not something that we can debate since its unlikely to happen just because a different disease did this 100 years ago.

Going with more real possibilities, the Fed could be a real reason if they start backing off to soon. I don't expect this to happen but its a possibility and we should take it into account.

The majority of people actually changing spending habits, being fearful of leaving the house or going to work.

The news. Now this one is a big one. If we take a deep dive into audience data for TV news we see that not a lot of people are actually watching them. This is also valid for Twitter, although the margins are a lot tighter. In a theoretical world this would mean that the news are not a huge influence. But they are. Not the TV news. Does are just for ratings. Almost everybody who has a decent chunk of money in the stock market does at least 1% research on their own. Now we expect the data to be bad, that's why we don't see the market going down. But if the data changes and starts coming worse than expected the market will react in accordance. A perfect example is the unemployment news. Right now we all expected it that's why the market didn't go down, but if this situation keeps going and once the country is open the numbers aren't correcting themselves its going to be a huge problem.

Inflation/Deflation numbers can also be a big influence. This is the only topic that I have an understanding for my own but a limited capacity to actually go in depth and explain if for someone else so I will just mention it and leave it here.

China trade war. If Trump cancels the agreement we are going to see a reaction for sure in the market, the only question remaining is how bad?  

&amp;#x200B;

**3. How to not make a buying decision**

&amp;#x200B;

Do not base you decision of buying a company, or anything for that matter on what some random persons says on reddit. Never! Even if that person is a super expert and he wants all the good in the world for you, once you buy something that you, personal have no clue about its going to be a source of anxiety because you don't know what happens. Its not worth it.

Do not buy just because FOMO (fear of missing out) - if you do not feel comfortable with the price before you buy, you will definitely not be comfortable after. Just be calm, controlled, do you research, make up your mind about a price, wait for it.

Do your due diligence. No matter the company. You want to buy Apple? Check their balance sheet, check their prospects, look at their future. Ask yourself questions: Will people need this company in 10 years? Will people still buy their products? Can they adapt to new markets? Can they grow their business? Make a list before looking at any company with the things that you care about, note your responses before investigating and then see if its a right fit for you.

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Why covid is not that horrible?**



Ah.. the downvoter topic. I was thinking not tackling this one but, whatever.. my opinion.

I want to start out by looking at Sweden. Do not start comparing the total numbers with the US because that is ridiculous, their population is much smaller.  Start comparing the per million numbers, there things get interesting: Deaths per million: 319 (USA is at 242), Cases per million: 2567 (USA has 4070), test per million: 14704 (USA has 26943). You can see the similarities. They have half the cases but also half the testing power so we can make an educated assumption and put them close to USA.

Sweden measures when comparing with USA are zero. They have very limited measures in place yet the case numbers evolves really similar. This is a case as to why the country should open.

The death rate is 100% overblown. Recent studies in Europe but also in USA start showing that the rate of infection is 20 to 100 higher than the official numbers. Even if we go with the low number of 20, that would put USA cases at over 25 million. This again proves that Covid is not that bad as we expected.

The majority of people that died (over 90%) are people over 65 with underlying conditions. Healthy, young people are just not affected nearly as bad some predicted. 

Do not interpret my words on this topic as taking in lightly. I am not. But in a healthy society we need to be able to debate both sides of the story and not only the one pushed in the media.

The upcoming transition from 4G to 5G is likely to initiate a new vibration in the tech industry. In the same way that a transition to 4G opened up space for the emergence of smartphones, mobile commerce, and mobile banking, the introduction of 5G network is expected to usher the next wave of technological advancements.

&amp;#x200B;

**QCOM: Qualcomm**

Qualcomm has an agreement with Apple to produce 5G chips for the iPhone-maker until at least 2023. Apple is expected to rollout its new 5G-enabled smartphone later this year, which should also include Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X55 5G chip. 

Therefore, supplying Apple – which sold 72.9 million iPhones in the fourth quarter last year – with 5G chips should enable Qualcomm with enough revenue to continue investing in the 5G network. 

&amp;#x200B;

**MRVL: Marvell**

Marvell has been on a roll recently, striking a contract with Samsung to provide chips to power LTE and 5G base stations. Moreover, the California-based company was chosen by Nokia to help the Finnish telecom giant to solve its 5G chip problems.

Shares of Marvell are trading around 10% off the 2020 highs, with technicals aligning for a potential move to $32 later this year, a 24.5% premium on the current market price.

&amp;#x200B;

**TXN: Texas Instruments**

As a major player in the semiconductor industry, Texas Instruments is another company expected to benefit from an uptick in demand for chips it produces. 

Texas Instruments reported stronger-than-expected financial results for the first quarter, with revenues for the second quarter seen in the region of $3 billion. 

&amp;#x200B;

**SWKS: Skyworks**

Skyworks is one of the most prominent suppliers for Apple with nearly 50% of annual revenues coming from the iPhone producer. 

“I think the technologies that we’re working on in our ecosystem with partners like Verizon and infrastructure players and even the Chinese, we’re all coming together to make this work, but it’s a real indication of how necessary these applications are to the economy,” said Skyworks Solutions CEO Liam Griffin.

The tech giant also produces turnkey engines that are seen as a critical element of the wireless infrastructure.

After a deep pullback in March, shares of Skyworks have since rebounded nearly 50%, trading above the $100 mark once again.

&amp;#x200B;

**My thoughts**

QCOM for me seems like the safest bet. Texas Instruments looks really interesting as well.
