I currently have an account with Ally Invest, but they charge $50 for any pink sheet trade, which isn‚Äôt worth it for my small positions. Is there a brokerage that doesn‚Äôt charge commissions on OTC trades?

Thanks. And before anyone says to buy an index fund instead, I‚Äôm well diversified and I‚Äôm young and this would represent a small portion of my portfolio. The two stocks I‚Äôm looking at are NEXCF (AR) and EKSO (healthcare)"

*[Keep in mind the asymptomatic period was reported to be at most 27 days](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/) and [patients whom recovered are developing the coronavirus and testing positive again](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-reinfection-explainer/explainer-coronavirus-reappears-in-discharged-patients-raising-questions-in-containment-fight-idUSKCN20M124), which means public exposure in these countries could have begun weeks ago. By Monday, I estimate that there will be at least 2,000 total new cases in the above countries experiencing the new outbreaks alone.*


*Why does this matter? This weekend the Corona Virus news will be flowing steadily, thus IMO influencing the virus stocks to continue to rise on Monday and throughout next week.*

-

**Controlling the outbreak is going to become increasingly difficult.**


[To control the majority of viral outbreaks, for R0 of 2-5 more than 70% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3¬∑5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced.The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1¬∑5. For R0 values of 2¬∑5 or 3¬∑5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X\(20\)30074-7/fulltext) 

[Researchers estimate the R0 value of COVID-19 to be likely between 4.7 and 6.6. Further, they speculate that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.07.20021154v1)


-

**The Case of Africa**

With the continent's [high volume of air traffic and trade between China](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0771-1) new outbreaks are inevitable.

Without treatment or vaccines, and without pre-existing immunity, sustained Corona Virus outbreaks might be devastating due to the multiple health challenges the continent already faces: rapid population growth and increased movement of people; existing endemic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria; remerging and emerging infectious pathogens such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa haemorrhagic fever, and others; and increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases.

[Governments are already anticipating demand and addressing supply chain management, mapping, and stockpiling of COVID-19 response needs](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30411-6/fulltext): large quantities of personal protective equipment, gloves, surgical masks, coveralls, and hoods, and medical countermeasures like antiviral agents.

IMO, the market for the products of Corona Virus stocks will increase exponentially when new outbreaks begin in this continent. 

-

**The Stock Market**

Things are about to get way worse.

[The Harvard Business review predicts that the peak of the impact of Covid-19 on global supply chains will occur in mid-March, forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe. The activity of Chinese manufacturing plants has fallen in the past month and is expected to remain depressed for months.](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-impact-the-global-supply-chain-by-mid-march)

Brace for a major effect on manufacturing worldwide. It will begin to hit full force in two to three weeks and could last for months. IMO, the only safe plays are plastic, Biotech, and Biopharmaceutical stocks. Liquidate your other positions now so you can buy back in lower. 

-

**The Vaccines Stocks**

According to the WHO, more than 20 coronavirus vaccines are in development around the world. IMO, I am waiting to invest in the below companies once they release more data on their Corona virus vaccines.

If the were going to provide each state and local health departments with testing capabilities, this might be a signal that test kits developed in the private sector will be distributed.

-

**Looking Forward to Next Week**

IMO, the virus news this weekend will be off the charts. As new outbreaks occur and the sustained outbreaks continue, the demand for these corona virus stocks will rise. 

I still stand by the recommendation from my initial posting, in which I suggested investing into the companies producing test kits and personal protection / medical equipment. 

I am still currently holding $APT, $AHPI, and $CODX. No vaccine companies at the moment. I feel that there is a great deal of profit to be made swinging these stocks using 15 second candle chart &amp; the 50, 100, and 200 day moving average. Take a look at how the stock behaved the last two days and find a plan that can work for you. Watch the volume in premarket as well on the various virus stock to get a sense of where the interest is for that day.

My Portfolio Breakdown:

* 65.5% AHPI: On Friday AHPI reached a crazy premarket high of $67 a share. Upon market opening, price dropped steaply down to $16. Looks to be continuing along a trend line for now. The reason I increased my holding % here is because the float is considerably smaller than APT. https://imgur.com/u9BO2UY

* 6.3% APT: Similarly to AHPI, the price reached a big high premarket and corrected its self to the support from 2/27. https://imgur.com/orOnmri

* 28.2% CODX: Big swings here. Had been previously following the 50 day moving average and corrected down to the 200 day / trend line. Still waiting on FDA approval or PR from the company on order numbers. Will sell upon receiving FDA approval for their test kits. https://imgur.com/MTTw8Y1

4,2020-02-03,MeLikesPineapples,1,"My case study on Spotify: Their Past, Present and Future","Over the past year, I have been reading books and articles about companies that achieved success and there were some common factors in the success of all of these:

A) How they treat their employees?

B) How they treat their customers?

C) Do they have a vision themselves?

D) Are they adaptable to changes? (and how they react to failure)

Spotify is showing signs of all of these and here is my case study on how they can improve for question D)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spotify is one of my favourite technology companies at the moment. Mainly because of their customer service (shout out to their Twitter team). I would love to see this company grow tremendously in a decades' time. For that to happen, Spotify need to realise they are in the tech industry and not just the entertainment industry. They have the potential to be huge market disruptors (for record labels, radio channels, content-driven sites like YouTube and Netflix). Technically, they can produce, distribute and market their own artists (like Netflix). They could own the entire music industry. But I'm glad they aren't yet, as it could have some serious backlash with the existing record labels deals on Spotify. They would pull out of the brand quickly if they sense competition. So, I do like that Spotify is focusing on podcasts specifically and separately in 2020.

This way, they are now competing only with radio channels (which are dying out already). Think of it in political war terms, if Spotify is the USA, then you wouldn't want to directly attack Russia or China, you would occupy smaller and weaker countries first.

Once they become dominant in podcasts and produce original content (and live radio too!) which matches up with the revenue from the music streaming, they will have the leverage on their side to go up against the music labels in a few years time, and actually start buying off artists from them (imagine the next Radiohead album being produced and distributed by Spotify). Similar to Netflix, they don't need to be stringent, like movie production companies and large music labels, with the type of content the ""audience will like"". Eventually, it could come down to Spotify or Netflix buying out each other (or partner up, which would be a smart move for both). Spotify in music and radio, Netflix in movies and TV shows.

Spotify has become a behemoth in the music streaming services. The personalisation of recommended tracks and the ability to create playlists are just fantastic and extremely user-friendly. Now that they have achieved this, they need to focus on other avenues that facilitate this, in the near future:

1. A built-in Voice Assistant
2. Spotify branded hardware (headphones/stereos/car speakers)
3. Video option in podcasts (creators can choose to upload videos for their podcasts)
4. Become a Music Label (final option, when they revenue sources from multiple other areas, as it would give them buying power)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A Built-in Voice Assistant

At the moment, if I use Siri or Google Assistant, it doesn't focus specifically on the Spotify app. I need say ""Hey Siri, could you please play Weird Fishes by Radiohead"". It will play the track based on what the first Google result is. If it's a YouTube video, then that's where you're headed.

With the Voice Assistant built-in for Spotify, you can just say ""Hey Spotify, please play the latest Joe Rogan episode"". It will find the most popular one within its parameters.

2) Spotify-branded hardware

With the new Bose QC35ii, we have seen they have partnered with Google (for Assistant) and Bose is also testing Augmented Reality on its headphones.

Spotify could branch out and partner with Bose for this AR feature. Maybe having a QR reader in the app, which you can use in a store to listen to albums by scanning the barcode, which would then play through the Bose headphones. This could also evolve to scanning any object in front of you, and Spotify will try to find a relevant track or podcast about that object.

3) Option to include videos in podcasts

The company has this technology already. When you play a song, you can see the music video on the background. Similarly, if I am listening to the Joe Rogan podcast, there could be a video uploaded which runs in the background. This would keep customers on the app itself and deter them from using YouTube to see the video.

4) Become a music label

This is the complete long-term option, which Spotify will definitely have to go through eventually. Not doing so would mean they will be stuck in the cycle of royalties and expenses.

Once they have diversified in other avenues, Spotify will have the bargaining power to take own the music industry.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like to research companies in my spare time and reading about entrepreneurs and their visions. With the right attitude, success will eventually be obtainable. By ""Success"", in this context, I mean not having to depend on others.

GoPro is a proper example of what not to do. Trying to dominate the market quick by following trends is not the way to do it. Their vision statement was too broad, and they placed priority on sales, rather than staff."

6,2020-03-04,d_boned_chicken,1,"When calculating FCF, do you include Cash and Cash Equivalents as a part of the change in working capital? If yes, then why?","My understanding is that an increase in working capital represents an equivalent deduction of cash since that cash is used up in the Inventory and AR and not used in the case of AP. But what if hypothetically, a company has been collecting cash up front from customers, and sells all its inventory. In this case working capital increases as its collections/sales increase, but they are realizing all of the sales in cash immediately, so the company is generating cash."
7,2020-04-30,Tendicity,1,MTCH set up for a short squeeze?,"With the advent of social distancing social media/web based services (food delivery, teleconferencing, exercise, education etc) engagement is surging (see recent FB, SNAP earnings reports). However, user base growth has been partially offset by decreased ad revenue.

Enter MTCH, 98% of revenue is attributable to direct sources, such as subscription fees, while ad revenue falls under indirect sources and comprises some portion of the remaining 2% (2019 AR). Current EPS estimates are around 9% lower than actual EPS Q4 '19 and have been downgraded multiple times in the last 90 days. Meanwhile short interest is extremely high (ranked #[2](https://www.highshortinterest.com/)) with a short float near [70%](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MTCH) and a time to cover of [18](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mtch/short-interest) days. 

The elephant in the room for this stock is the pending IAC separation and I do not pretend to understand how this event will impact the long-term outlook for MTCH. However, investors do not appear to have been spooked by a recently announced amendment to the IAC separation deal and it is hard to believe that this will weigh heavily on the interpretation of Q1 results. 

Despite dropping estimates I see no reason for a Q1 drop in MTCH revenue or EPS given the data now available from FB and SNAP; if true this puts MTCH in position for a significant earnings beat. Short sellers are vulnerable to this EPS suprise and may find themselves in a squeeze; this may also be triggered if the stock continues to climb on positive market sentiment from other large corps' (AMZN) reports this week."

Went public last week I believe, bought some shares, but I'm not sure if buying it this early was such a good idea as I'm not even sure if they will raise the projected $$$. Anyone believe this company can do the next big thing in AR that FB or microsoft cant?"

12,2020-04-05,ourbigbluestar,1,"With Zero Fee Trading Accounts, are there disadvantages of buying small numbers of low price stocks.","When brokers required trading fees, i would never buy say 3 shares of a stock that trades ar 10 dollars. Because the stock would have to rise a lot for me to cover transactions costs. 

My broker (fidelity) now no longer charges trading fees. So it seems i would make money on low price stocks even with small rises. Especially ifblow price stocks have high volatility.

For example, i am thinking about buying say 3 shares of Luckin coffee stock after its major drop. 

Are any of you buying small numbers of low price stocks now with your zero fees account?

Are there some hidden costs i am not considering?

Thanks!"

14,2020-05-10,Scatchell,1,Suggestions on gaining AR/VR exposure through an existing fund,"Hey all - I know there are a few posts about this already, but I was struggling when searching the sub to find assets that represent an already balanced collection of assets, something like an ETF, that would gain me AR/VR exposure without too much trouble (i.e. not having to build a portfolio of specific stocks) - wondered if any investors on this sub had suggestions?

I realize companies like Facebook, Nvidia, HTC, etc. are making some of the big headsets, but I wondered if there were any funds people knew about that could help me gain exposure to those big players but also other related companies, like manufacturers of specific parts for this tech, companies that are building software for AR/VR, etc.

Any thoughts are much appreciated!"
15,2020-05-08,greg_718,1,NEXCF - Future potential of Nextech AR,"Nextech AR Solutions (NEXCF)

I'll make this quick and start off by saying I'm a rookie with regard to the stock market but have done my fair share of research into smaller / ""off the radar"" companies poised with interesting opportunities and lucrative potential.

I was first introduced to NEXCF right before their big blastoff breakout, 52-week high price after news of their launch of 3D augmented reality (3D/AR) solution for online eCommerce product placement advertising.

The CEO of the company seems to have always been, most especially in recent weeks, an active member of the shareholder community and stands behind his brand. There have been plenty of online press releases detailing his investments and purchases of company shares -- and just recently purchasing nearly one million shares himself -- so buying his own stuff means things are going well and he's pretty confident about it, right? He also regularly hosts online video conference calls where he welcomes investors and speculators to come in and chat, watch the show and ask questions -- all done in live action! I feel like he's always been very transparent with his company practices and future plans -- which has lead me to be a firm believer of NEXCF.

Not to mention, although NEXCF is labeled as having OTC shares, their reputation precedes themselves by openly reporting acquisitions, partnerships, revenues, profits, etc.

Also looks like volume and share price have been going up somewhat steadily in recent weeks.

Any thoughts, opinions or suggestions about NEXCF?"
16,2020-05-05,Bickl3s,3,Pandemic‚Äôs Long Term Impact on the US Economy?,"With unemployment surging, earnings reports missing expectations, dropping consumer spending and decreasing US economic output, seems like a good time to share ideas on the below. 

1. Industries most at risk and those that stand to benefit?
2. Effects on cash/crypto/securities/real estate? 

My brief thoughts:
- Market drops significantly in mid/late July when Q2 earnings disappoint. Followed by tough year/years ahead.
- At risk: Oil, Retail, QSRs
-To benefit: Big Tech, VR/AR, Logistics/Supply Chain, Vices (Weed/Alcohol/Tobacco)
- Cash devalued from stimulus, increased adoption of crypto (although not sure how much), drop in overall equities market with a few unicorns and safe bets, and a 6-8 month lag before sharp decline in RE prices due to lack of demand, sentiment and lowered consumer cash reserves."
17,2020-05-04,JSchoenleb,1,"ASR, Undervalued Stock #1"," Over the next week, I will be sharing all the stocks I bought and why starting with my smallest position and leading to my largest position. 

&amp;#x200B;

This company was found using my proprietary discounted cash flow application I coded for my master's thesis/project.  


Ticker: ASR  
Industry Group: Transportation  


Brief Description: Operates, maintains, and develops airports in the southeast region of Mexico (tourist destinations)  


Intrinsic Stock Price: $148.95  


Notable Profitability Ratios:  
27.6% Profit Margin, 21% Net Operating Profit Margin  


Notable Productivity Ratios:  
3 AR Turnover, 8.3 AP Turnover, 8.7 PPE Turnover  


Notable Leverage Ratios:  
Lower than average leverage at 1.8  


Notable Liquidity Ratios:  
3 Current, 3 Quick  


Airlines will be affected for ""13 to 26 months"". Taking the current situation into account, liquidity ratios are more important than ever when evaluating transportation companies. I found great security knowing that ASR has enough cash to cover its yearly obligations 3 times over (Quick Ratio).  


On top of strong fundamentals, ASR also offers a 5.3% dividend  


I have included the assumptions of the algorithm and the revenue forecast If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know!
