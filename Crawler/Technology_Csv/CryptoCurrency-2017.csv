got a lot of attention and praise, and it definitely shed some light on the burgeoning field of digital currencies. However, it definitely hit a few nerves.

**Anyone who says Coin X is better than Coin Y has a financial conflict of interest. You should not be listening to that person.**

It's hard for people outside of our crypto-community to realize how dangerous the social manipulation is. In the aforementioned thread, the OP clearly has a strong Bitcoin bias, was fairly bearish on Ethereum, and among other subtle pumps here and there.

I promise you, he didn't warn you about the ""scam"" of Ripple or say that ""its not even a real cryptocurrency"" out of the goodness of his heart, but rather because he wants you to go out and buy Bitcoin instead.

I also saw the regular shills from all the communities come in and pump their coin in the comments. It's a small community. Everybody knows everybody. They come in here with the party tagline because hey! it's exposure in \/r/investing! And then wars erupt in the comments (which is the norm for us). I don't think I saw any actual core developers comment in that thread.

**The truth is your own research**

I won't sit here and pump my coin. I won't even mention what I have. I immediately acknowledge my own financial conflict of interest. If you want to invest in crypto, **do your own fucking research**. Don't ""buy bitcoin because it does the best long term"" as the OP casually mentioned. Every coin has pros and cons. Bitcoin has flaws in category A, and Ethereum has flaws in category B, and etc etc, and all the communities argue with each other about whose set of flaws is worse than the others, while completely hiding their own coin's flaws. If I wanted to, I could make a factual case to go margin long or short any coin, simply by not mentioning the other side of the argument. I've seen rampant censorship and social manipulation across every coin on reddit, twitter, slack, facebook, and so on. I can't even in good conscience tell you where to get your information from, because that is another source of bias in itself.

**Investing in cryptos is hard. If someone reduces it to something as simple as ""just buy coin Z,"" they are just trying to pad their own pockets.**

Thank you.

12,2017-05-10,isrly_eder,530,Cryptocurrencies and the circle of competence,"*A quick note to investors that believe the intrinsic value of bitcoin is 0 because they can't do a DCF on it: this isn't the place to argue with me about it. I suggest you read a bit more about what it actually is (hint: not a currency). I've defended its value in plenty of other posts on this sub. It's a $40+ billion market, so at least a few people agree with me. I welcome you to short the crypto of your choice if you think it's worth nothing. This is a post for folks that believe that cryptocurrencies have at least some discernible value and are considering investing in them.*

***

&gt; If we have a strength, it is in recognizing when we are operating well within our circle of competence and when we are approaching the perimeter.  – Warren Buffett

Given the tripling of the cryptocurrency market cap in the last few months and the 3- to 10-fold increases in virtually every major altcoin, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and of course Bitcoin have been getting a stunning amount of attention in the press and on this subreddit recently. 

If you follow the cryptocurrency world closely, you know that there have been a huge amount of dubious ICOs (initial coin offerings) on the market recently. It's an explosive time in crypto. 

It's also a frustrating time for many long term bitcoiners and crypto fans, because we're faced with a barrage of questions from outsiders who see the returns and want to buy in to the ""next big thing"" and make a quick buck. This is a warning to those people. 

Everyone is a genius is a rising market. It's hard to go wrong these days in crypto. Even coins of dubious merit like Ripple, Dogecoin, Stellar, NEM were pumped 5 times without any fundamental change. Speculators/investors have thrown money at crypto indiscriminately and efficient markets have 100% broken down. The altcoin pump right now is roughly comparable to the Dot Com crisis of the early 2000s. 

1. New tech promises to change the world
2. Investors jump in on hype and promises
3. A surge of IPOs (ICOs) occurs to capitalize on this
4. ""Greater fool"" traders pile in, thinking they can make money even if the underlying is unsound
5. Analysts claim ""this time is different"" while seasoned old hands refuse to participate
6. Tech is proven not to be as developed as everyone thinks, market tanks 
7. Select few decent companies survive, all the trash is destroyed
8. Tech eventually fulfills expectations, 10 years later, but none of the investors from the early days make money on it

However, canny (and skeptical) investors can still make money on crypto, as cryptocurrencies are inevitable, and will continue to expand and proliferate, even when the altcoin crash comes. 

Something to realize first of all is that the crypto market is heterogeneous. It has straightforward cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, litecoin, dash, monero), smart-contract cryptos (ethereum, ethereum classic) and a whole bunch of crypto tokens that follow dedicated platforms (golem, augur, steem). Not mentioned are ripple and stellar because they aren't really cryptocurrencies at all.

The investing theses for all of these categories is radically different. The measure of success for a currency or store of value is adoption, merchant use, low volatility, a large network, and real world acceptance as something worth owning. Bitcoin has this right now, which is why it's more than 50% of the ecosystem, and none of its competitors are even close. Monero, Zcash, and [Dash](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/69ez1b/7500_faceless_coders_paid_in_bitcoin_built_a/dh7ajya/) are a special case in that they try and make transactions anonymous and privacy, allowing for use cases on the darknet markets, for instance. 

The tech underlying bitcoin is essentially sound, although it is having a scalability crisis, which you should read about. It can't right now serve as a currency which will buy you a cup of coffee - the transaction fees are too high. However if you want to send $200,000 from Mexico to Indonesia or China to the Philippines, you can do it within 20 minutes, and with fees of a few dollars. And if you want to store your wealth in a vault that is totally secure, and cannot be debased by a central bank, bitcoin is a good bet. This is highly relevant to folks in India that just had cash abolished, to Venezuelans, to Argentines, to Cypriots, to Nigerians, anywhere local currencies are weak and volatile. The potential value of a competing cryptocurrency lies in whether it can improve materially on bitcoin, whether it means incorporating off-chain scaling (segwit with litecoin), making it more private and fungible (monero), automating governance (decred), and so on. 

Then there are cryptoassets that incorporate smart contracts. These – ethereum and its derivatives – exploded when the SEC denied the Bitcoin ETF back in march and bitcoiners got worried and started diversifying. This is the market segment that is highly risky, even by crypto standards, in my opinion. Ethereum is a protocol that allows contracts to self-enforce. Programming power to run the contracts is paid for with ethereum. Two parties agree to a contract, and it then self-executes. It's secured by a decentralized computing network of ethereum miners, so the contracts cannot be shut down by a government or corporation. It's pretty clever. Last year, a $150+ million contract was drawn up with ethereum, which would act like a venture capital fund, picking good investments just based on the votes of the token holders. This was called a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, and it was hacked before it could do anything. Well, it was exploited based on the code and so the exploit was totally ""fair"" given that the contract was meant to be inevitable, once agreed to. However, the creators of Ethereum didn't like the idea of losing $50 million, so they decided to collectively agree to amend the rules of the protocol itself (violating ""Code is Law""), and jump onto a new one, which they would also call Ethereum, although it was really Ethereum 2.0. Some people got upset by this, because they thought that immutability and not arbitrarily rolling back the code was more important than some investors losing money because of poorly written code. They created Ethereum Classic, which is the original Ethereum chain. This wasn't what the Ethereum 2.0 folks thought would happen, but it did happen, so there are two competing Ethereum chains now. 

Eventually, lots of decentralized apps were funded, via tokensales. A development team would say: ""we're going to use ethereum to create a decentralized cloud computing/AI/prediction/gambling/timestamping/social media network."" And then investors would buy the tokens, expecting that eventually the dev team would deliver, and the tokens would be in demand, since they would be required to use the network. It's a bit like buying in-game-currency when the game is announced, anticipating that the game would be wildly popular and you'd be able to sell it on later at a profit or acquire it cheaply to buy in-game items later on. However, many of us think that the promises are a bit extravagant, and that investors in these ICOs are probably going to lose money. The incentives aren't well aligned. Founders can just not deliver and run off with the money, and there's no regulatory body to enforce that. And for Ethereum more broadly, many people are worried that the turing-completeness of the language will mean it will face serious threats and unforeseeable hacks, like with the DAO. Finally, Ethereum has increased from around $20 to $90 in a matter of months, which raises the question of whether a) the market realized its true value or b) it was pumped on speculation. There's a huge set of unknowns with a smart contract currency, and virtually none of the promised dapps are up and running right now, and the ones that are haven't really attracted large userbases or delivered. This is because the tech is in its infancy, and the developers are still learning how to use it properly. So we won't know if these sorts of decentralized networks are even possible to create on the timelines that investors are expecting. Therefore, ethereum investors buying it on the promise of the realization of this tech in the near future are almost guaranteed to be disappointed. Additionally, ethereum is making the switch to the largely untested Proof of Stake algorithm, which will change incentives that secure the network. This brings me to my key point: 

**Stay within your circle of competence. You can grow your circle – slowly. Cryptoassets are almost impossibly complex to grasp with just a cursory look. Investing in them requires weeks of reading and a very skeptical view.**

***

The above was an introduction to cryptocurrencies, the different ones on offer, and why investing in ethereum is not the slam dunk everyone thinks it is. This portion of the post will tell you about the kind of due diligence you need to do if you want to invest, rather than speculate, in crypto. 

The first thing to mention is that passive investing in crypto has [historically been a terrible strategy](http://woobull.com/crypto-currency-index-funds-the-simulations-have-surprising-results/). Just buying bitcoin almost always outperformed. This was due to the poor set of altcoins, and the size of bitcoin's almost insurmountable network effect. This sort of changed in March and April when bitcoin's dominance went from 80% to ~50%, and it remains to be seen if this will persist or not. But the point is, buying the index is usually an awful strategy in crypto, particularly because there are so many truly awful projects out there. 

So what does it take to invest responsibly in cryptocurrencies? It requires at least a basic understanding of three disciplines: public-private key cryptography; programming, and how open-source projects function; and economics, particularly game theory and the quantity theory of money. This is why is is so difficult to apprehend easily: because very few people actually boast a sincere understanding of these three topics. I certainly don't. 

You need to be able to determine whether the tech is actually going anywhere, and whether the task the developers have set themselves is possible or realistic. You need to know how open source networks are governed, and which models strike the best balance between efficiency of decision-making and fair consensus. You need to be able to measure the inflation schedule of the cryptocurrency, and see whether your coins are going to inflated away. You need to be able to make plausible guesses about the potential market for the crypto and estimate future values. Note that the payoff structure is not equity-like. It's more like early stage venture capital, or buying loss-making biotech companies. Here's my checklist of questions to answer, ordered by importance: 

* Does the project offer a significant improvement over its nearest competitor, or a reasonable chance of success in its stated aim? Is there a demand for this project? Does it have a concise and reasonable goal? (Narrower goal: higher likelihood of success). 

* Is the development team competent? Are they committed to the coin? What's their track record? Is is an active dev team? Do they have a roadmap for the future? Are they transparent about goals? 

* How is the development team funded? Is the currency corporate-backed? Is the funding transparent? Was the coin significantly premined? (Usually bad) Are developers paid via iterative community project crowdfunding? (Usually good). 

* What is the governance structure of the currency? Who holds ultimate control over decisionmaking? How are decisions made? Are they transparent? Are mining/developer incentives aligned? 

* Does the asset have acceptance and use today? Does it have a functioning use case? If it doesn't, does it have a decent chance of being accepted? 

* Has the asset's ""market cap"" tripled or quintupled in the last few months? Was this based on any fundamental changes (new software releases, etc) or just speculation? 

* What are the transaction volumes like? (Hint: divide market cap by monthly averaged daily on-chain tx volume to find a consistent ratio) What's the ratio of on-chain transaction versus exchange speculation? Has price gone up independent of transaction volumes? 

* How long has the asset been around? Think of the Lindy effect. Older is usually better. 

* What's the community like? Is there censorship? Does it have an active subreddit? Do the developers answer questions? Are they accessible? How big is the github community? (Hint: you can divide market cap by github commits to find a comparable ratio). 

* Are you psychologically able to hold this coin in a 90% downturn? Is this a high conviction thesis or are you betting on being able to sell it to a greater fool? 

How long did it take you to learn about investing in equities? Reading balance sheets, running DCF and DRI models, figuring out how to value a stock based on comparables? Years? How many mistakes did you make before you figured out how to be responsible? 

Cryptos are an [asset class](http://research.ark-invest.com/bitcoin-asset-class) that is both radically different from anything that has existed before. They are also incredibly heterogeneous, as I argued above. It also leads to cultism – so bitcoiners generally take a dim view of ethereum, and vice versa. Monero fans generally don't like dash, and so on. You have to keep your mind open to understand new opportunities as they arise, and to stop yourself becoming too mentally invested in your project of choice. The vast majority of projects will fail within 5 years, so becoming overly certain of the success of one will probably devastate you. If you can stay balanced, stay honest about your crypto's chances of success and adoption, not get tunnel vision, and not take overly risky positions, you have a good chance of not losing everything. Remember the payoff structure. Heavily rightward skewed. A ton of cryptos earn no return and a select few earn an absurd (1,000-10,000x) return. 

None of this is necessary if you just want to invest randomly in one of the top ten cryptos. That's the strategy of 95% of investors today. Pick a coin and go. If it's not bitcoin, I can pretty much guarantee you'll lose money. The newer, the worse. 

I've not made an effort to convince you that cryptos have intrinsic value. If you've made it this far, you probably think they're worth something at least. However, they're probably not worth as much as the market is pricing them at right now. Especially not those in the ethereum family. I'm not going to tell you what to invest in, because that would defeat the purpose of this post. I'm telling you to do your due diligence before blindly buying a crypto. And that due diligence on ethereum is as complex and difficult as Tesla or Amazon DD. And that your skills in equity valuation are pretty much useless in this asset class. My circle of competence doesn't extend to options or lean pork futures, so I don't touch those. I suggest that until you really feel comfortable in crypto, you don't buy randomly. 

***

Summative thoughts: 

1. Investing in crypto is hard 
2. 90% of people that invest at market peaks will lose money 
3. You have to extremely skeptical and invest in high-conviction positions 
4. Cryptos are exhibiting bubbly behavior right now, it's a pretty bad time to pick one out
5. Cryptos are nothing like equities but they do have real value
6. Cryptos are the future, but almost none of these coins will survive 10 years
7. The older the better
8. Governance is key
9. These are speculative positions, only invest what you can tolerate losing
10. You can make money investing in cryptos 
11. Passively investing in cryptos doesn't work
12. It's a winner takes most market, there won't be 1 crypto that wins. There will be different cryptos for different use cases. 


edit: deleted chart with probabilities of success because of subjectivity and oversimplification. 

edit2: I've been overwhelmed with PMs so bear with me. also, please forgive any spelling errors on this post. I wrote it in one frenzied sitting.

edit3: I knew I would get a fair amount of resistance from ethereum investors (even though I attempted to keep my post as balanced as possible) but I was unprepared from the breathtaking volume of spam and diversity of attacks. One particular user has made 30 comments in this thread. I don't have a stake in ETC, period. The post is 3000 words long and most of it is about how to properly do your due diligence in a crypto. if ethereum fares poorly by standard due diligence metrics, then perhaps your issue is deeper than one post on /r/investing. 

**final edit: there have been some broken-hearted ethereum fans very busy organizing [brigades](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6as0ag/etc_trolls_in_rinvesting_trying_to_confuse_new/) against this post, and attacking me personally, and so on. It's all very incovenient. I can tell that I struck a nerve. This post isn't really about ethereum - it's about how to do research in crypto, and why you can't expect to profit handsomely without that due diligence. I mentioned ethereum because there are 3 or 4 breathless posts on here a day about its stunning gains and whether it's worth investing in. My answer: read about it first, from a diverse set of sources. A final note: I do not own any ethereum classic, I have never owned ethereum classic. I brought it up because it is part of the ethereum story, and an example of what happens when you have a contested hard fork. I do hope that ethereum succeeds, I am just cautioning against over exuberance.**"
13,2017-05-09,vegaseller,3,Bitcoin/Crypto - Unsound Fundamentals,"Cryptocurrencies are quite simple to understand once you ignore the technobabble.

The logic is quite simple, for cryptocurrencies to be worth a lot, they need to see widespread mainsteam adoption by consumers and merchants. The problem is:

A) A cryptocurrency which have artificial scarcity that can appreciates alot is volatile, hoarded by speculators and unlikely to be used by merchants or consumers, therefore removing the very reason which could see it appreciate.
B) A digital currency which is pegged to a national currency will see widespread adoption by merchants or consumers (See China and Wechat/Alipay), but you don't make money hoarding these digital currencies. 

If one wants to look at the future of digital payments ecosystem, one just needs to study China, where credit card networks were not developed. Close to USD100 billion of transaction goes through the wechat app per month, people link their bank account and credit card to wechat and purchase everything from street vendor food to bus tickets to store purchases using qr code. Nowhere in this ecosystem is there a place for a crytocurrency hoarder to make money. At the end of the day, merchants need to pay suppliers and workers in the local currency, consumers need to trust the medium of exchange. Thus there is no fundamentals whatsoever behind these crytocurrencies outside evading capital controls and purchasing illicit goods, which will result in some sort of government crackdown if it becomes too mainstream. Please prove me wrong."
14,2017-05-05,XanJamZ,3,Investing Partnership Endeavors,"I have been investing money as well as my friends money in some low risk high return cryptocurrency.  It's been going well and calculating the percentages of return for each investor has been simple so far, however as it gains more and more money is being added it's starting to get a little more complicated.

So my questions are for clarification and discussion. 
1. If a friend invests 20$ at 150$ Total Portfolio Value(TPV) making it 170$ he now has 8.5% stake, correct?
2. If same friend adds another 20$ once the portfolio doubles to 340$ he would only receive half the additional percentage increase? So 12.75% with 40$ total in at 340$ TPV?
3. This is the most brain racking question. So let's say we are at 400$ and a different friend adds 100$ so 500$ TPV. His percentage is 20% but this would also water down other friends 12.5% as well as my stake. 

To summarize, the first two points I'm pretty sure about but could use an equation to get the same correct answer everytime and not rely on dummy math. The last point I know it will water down all existing stakes with new investor money I just need an equation.

He's arguing you can invest in a cryptocurrency such as Ethereum or bitcoin while I'm saying it's pure speculation. There's no ownership in anything if you buy an ethereum or bitcoin. If you invest in the company, they value shareholders while a currency can't provide the same relationship.

&gt; The SEC's Report of Investigation found that tokens offered and sold by a ""virtual"" organization known as ""The DAO"" were securities and therefore subject to the federal securities laws. 

&gt; [...]

&gt; In light of the facts and circumstances, the agency has decided not to bring charges in this instance, or make findings of violations in the Report, but rather to caution the industry and market participants:  the federal securities laws apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology.

--------

My view of this, as someone who owns a lot of ether, is generally positive. The space is currently running rampant with a great deal of irrational exuberance. This should (hopefully) tone that down a bit. 

Moreover, the fact that they have chosen to issue a caution rather than pursue prosecution (any number of previous ICOs could likely be defined as a security) makes me optimistic that they do not want to stifle innovation in the area. I hope this can help bring 'blockchainised' securities into the mainstream. "

I'd like to warn you before you make an account with this CFD broker. As you surely know, cryptocurrency these days is on a rollercoaster. A dream of a day trader. But not with Plus500. If there is a high volatility, Plus500 will start manipulating displayed price which starts to drift further away from reality. A little example from today:

Today's BTC high on cryptowat.ch: $2400

Plus500 high: little over $2300

Pretty big difference, huh? Soon after it started to creep back down, the price started to more or less match again.

Few minutes ago there was a dip in ETH. Price on cryptowat.ch reached $190, while the price on plus500 got stuck on $198 for several minutes, completely ignoring the dip in progress.


Not enough? On Sunday, during the crypto crash I had opened ETH short positions at $151 few minutes before 12:00 of UTC+1, and to my happiness, the crash continued as planned. Then, at 14:00, the servers disconnected. A weekly 14:00-15:00 server maintenance. ""Ok, shit happens, surely nothing can go wrong in an hour, r-right?"", or so I thought. The servers came back on at around 15:00, but the trading was still blocked. Could not close a position nor open one. Soon after, ETH started it's recovery from $130 low ($137 low on plus500). By the time the trading was enabled again (~20 min), almost all of my profits were long since wiped out. Support was unreachable during that time. Unfortunately it did not occur to me to take a screenshot, as I had better things to worry about (like, you know, my whole account). Contacting support afterwards proved an utter waste of time.


Another fishy thing is, scalping is illegal on plus500 under the threat of blocked account and possibly ""stealing"" all of your profits. How does plus500 define ""scalping""? I have no idea, since they don't tell! https://www.plus500.com/FAQ/Trading/AreThereRestrictionsWithRegardsToTradingMethods


You can easily google many other ""horror stories"" regarding Plus500. Take that for what it's worth. 


tl;dr Plus500 is scam, do your homework before signing up.

Users Lose Ethereum &amp; Bitcoin,"Bithumb, the world's fourth largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, confirmed a security incident during which an unknown hacker was able to make off with an yet undetermined amount of funds.

Clues that something was wrong emerged on Thursday, when South Korean users, who make most of Bithumb's userbase, started complaining on a local social network about losing control over large funds stored in their Bithumb accounts.

A day later after these complaints, the company officially admitted the breach in a blog post on its website, albeit it did not provide any meaningful details.
Based on a blog post published on Monday, the exchange doesn't seem to know the exact amount of money the attacker took. Nonetheless, in a gracious move, the company is willing to provide compensations of up to 100,000 won ($897) per affected user until midnight July 5.

""As soon as the amount of damages is confirmed, we will reimburse the entire amount of damages,"" said Bithumb in an official statement.

According to user complaints, the hacker stole both Bitcoin and Ethereum from user accounts. Besides being the fourth largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, Bithumb is also the Internet's second largest Ethereum trading platform by volume.

Bithumb told South Korean media it contacted law enforcement last week and informed them of the theft.

Two months ago, an unknown attacker hacked fellow South Korean Bitcoin exchange Yapizon and stole 3816.2028 Bitcoin (over $5.5 million).

This is not the only Ethereum-related hack that took place this past week. Also last Thursday, an unknown attacker has gained control over the web domain of Classic Ether Wallet, a client-side wallet system for the Ethereum Classic (ETC) cryptocurrency. The hacker set up a fake website, and used it to phish user credentials and intercept and redirect ETC transactions."

And that brings us to our chart of the day from Bespoke Premium. It lays out how the cryptocurrency’s rise stacks up against that of assets that eventually bubbled.

The chart shows how technology and home builder stocks traded in the days leading up to their bubbles. And in that light, if bitcoin was going to pop, the runup has been far more dramatic.

“The point was we don’t know if it’s a bubble or not, but we know how past bubbles look. And this is a comparison of bitcoin versus past bubbles,” said Justin Walters, co-founder of Bespoke, in an emailed comment.

The cryptocurrency has now surged past $4,000. It’s up a good 60% so far this month and up 360% so far this year.

On Twitter, the chart elicited a range of responses. “One problem here is hindsight bias. Comparing bitcoin to known bubbles assumes bitcoin is a bubble itself,” @InvestingonSale argues.

Binance BNB - 2156.89% since trading on July 25

The chart &amp; above are non ICO prices from coinmarketcap.com
If going by ICO prices from https://icostats.com/roi-since-ico the highest all time return has been NXT at  718,805% in 2013.
Stratis from June last year has had 83,304%
QTUM from March this year has had 3940%
OMG's return on the ICO price is 3163%

In the broadest sense, Moas sees the current state of the cryptocurrency market as a direct parallel to Silicon Valley during the 1990s, when a massive surge of innovation created new technologies that transformed the way we work and live and ushered in a period of massive wealth creation.

58,2017-08-22,101trajectory,1,Let's get a few things clear about cryptocurrencies.,"This is what you really need to know, juxtaposing BTC against USD. While they function differently, they are actually quite similar in their most significant requirement to succeed, value anchoring.

**Transactional Ease**

BTC is fundamentally a digital currency, whereas USD is a hybrid that allows physical cash exchanges. USD is easier to hold and transfer small amounts in person. Both BTC and USD can be transferred digitally, but BTC is faster for large international transfers.

**Unique Certification**

Unique certification is how a currency defends against duplication to avoid currency fraud. BTC has the blockchain, whereas USD has pattern minting for physical cash and rigorous laws/procedures for banks' digital accounts. BTC is weak against 51% attacks and vulnerable code. USD is weak against counterfeiting and bank fraud. 

**Supply Control**

BTC can be mined by solving progressively harder computational problems (capped at pre-defined limit, 21M). USD is printed and loaned out (generally unlimited). Money supply presents an interesting problem for BTC. If it gains mass non-speculative adoption, it faces the same challenge that USD underwent around economic growth and the need for a larger supply to maintain a healthy velocity of money. Though credit accounts help, we may see some novel indirect exchange technologies in the future. 

**Value Anchoring**

This is the most important principle behind how fiat-like currencies work. Like how US restaurants charge a fixed price for their food, US stores have an entrenched price system that ignores currency exchange rates. No matter what, $10 USD will get you a decent meal in many US areas. USD also has absolute demand in the form of government taxes and fees.

Bitcoin has no such value anchors. This is its most fundamental challenge. There is nothing to suggest a burger should cost 1 BTC or 0.1 BTC due to the vast majority of BTC acceptors using exchange-derived prices. There is no fundamental institution that demands BTC. Volatility is left unrestrained.

This marks the importance of backing a currency to establish entrenched-price value anchors before withdrawing the backing. Even those who adopt BTC solely to transfer money want stability. Hypothetically, consider what happens if the US government introduces a Cryptocurrency Stability Program that offers to buy any batches of 1K BTC for 1M USD. That's a unit price of $1000 per BTC. This program may cause BTC to plummet, but it will produce some stability and the insurgence of fixed BTC prices. This is one of the roads toward a successful cryptocurrency, though to the stable chagrin of wild speculators.

To be fair, I cancelled my subscription 4 years ago but the most popular content on the service are its original works. I also looked at its enormous debt and while revenue has gone up, its profit margin is starting to suffer. How long can they sustain the enormous costs? They also announced a budget of $7 billion for 2018, it's going to be tough to make enough profit to make up for it. I've also read about how international subscribers have had price increases in recent years. How long until US customers are going to be charged more? I think that Netflix is no longer a viable stock after 2018.

Recent week has shown that consumers have placed too much faith into Nvidia because of the cryptocurrency gold rush. Now that AMD has launched its new product lines, will Nvidia begin to see competition ramp up in the GPU department? I was very big on NVDA for the past year but now I am becoming concerned because I believe there is a huge discrepancy between market price and true value.

60,2017-08-14,picomentos,21,3 Things You Should know Before Investing in Cryptocurrencies,"This is a brief and opinionated rundown of things you should know before making this step.


**The Market is extremely volatile**


When it comes to making an investment the very first thing you should know is what kind of place you are entering. This means you have to know about the market you’ll be investing, its behaviour and its quirks. Now, this is a crucial step and a rule of thumb for every kind of investment, from stocks to real estate, not just cryptocurrencies.

If you’ve been following Bitcoin for a bit, you’ve probably know that its price skyrocketed and just recently, it surpassed the $3,500 mark. Altcoins such as Etherium, Monero & Litecoin have seen a tremendous rise in the their price: they went from costing a few cents or dollars up to tens or hundreds of dollars within a few months. This led to huge returns for early adopters and holders that cashed out their assets. You could argue that this is because of an increase in their adoption, but the main reason behind it is the trust that people put on Bitcoin. While on the rise, it pulls everything up on its way.

Someone might say that volatility is a good thing. Think again.

While volatility opens up the door to great opportunities, it also paves the way with high risk options. Bitcoin and Etherium might look stable and safe, but considering the “pumps and dumps” that numerous altcoins have experienced so far, it’s more than clear that things are unpredictable. Even Bitcoin itself experienced a big drop around $1800 recently, but only to start rising again.

It’s been a crazy ride with ups and downs, but mostly ups so far. Just keep an eye on the market before making any moves.

**It does not scale**

I’m not referring to technical scaling problems here.

Some people, tend to think of cryptocurrencies as an alternative medium that will provide them some sort of economic freedom. Some of them advocate the benefits of cryptocurrencies over FIAT, but at the same time they’re after their FIAT price. I seen no freedom and independence in this.

There’s also a bit of contradiction when you start thinking of how the cryptocurrency ecosystem is built around traditional regulators and central authorities.

Just to give you an example: think about liquidating your crypto assets. When it comes to that, every tool you have at your disposal - and I mean everything - is linked to the authorities everyone is trying stay away from. Most of the exchanges require your identity or passport to activate your account, your transactions are being monitored and are subject to investigation if your government decides so and on top of that, you have to link your bank account in order to withdraw funds. 

Yes, you read this right. Banks. Not to mention taxes.

Your profits from cryptos are translated into FIAT currency. Everyone is trying to stay away from the banks but at the same time are linking their bank account to their Coinbase wallet. To get more of that, most of us are “dying” to know if Bitcoin will surpass the $4,500 mark or not. I don’t think that everyone would be so hyped about cryptos if Bitcoin costed just a few cents.

Another inevitable thing that’s happening, is the amount of fees you get charged for making transactions. If you plan to invest significant amounts of money in cryptos, you have to consider the amount of fees you have to pay in order to exchange your FIAT with cryptos and vice versa.

Not sure if cryptos can scale as a stand-alone currency next to traditional FIAT currencies with all these going on.

**There is no regulation**

Cryptocurrency markets are not transparent.

People have invested tons of money to what turned out to be sketchy ICOs or “Pumps ’n’ Dumps”. There was no roadmap, no tech team, no support, no nothing behind these coins and everyone was sold just on the idea that this coin could be the next bit thing that could make them rich. It’s sad and the “community” should be pro-active to avoid cases like ChainCoin.  

I’ve used the word “community” here, only because it’s frequently used in social media by people who want to describe other people that are into cryptocurrencies. Honestly, I don’t feel that it’s the right word.

Apart from a handful of people that speak their mind about cryptos and publicly share information about their investments, everyone else acts a bit sketchy. Social media, Reddit subforms and YouTube are full of people that promote Ponzi-like cryptocurrency companies that promise interest on interest for just a few hundreds of dollars. Compound interest. You should always keep in mind what they say about it:

Compound interest is the 8th Wonder of the World. He who understands it earns it, he who doesn't pays it!

This is where market regulation should kick in, but unfortunately there’s no such thing in the cryptocurrency market. People are allowed to promote whatever they want, leaving the end consumer exposed to high risk options and possible capital loss.

The decentralisation and absence of central authority is a double edged knife for cryptos. You have to do your homework before making a move."

75,2017-09-04,Ordinary_investor,31,Psychological aspect of investing,"Greetings everyone, 

First of all, sorry for my English, as it is not my native language.

This post or rather a question is perhaps not directly investing related, more towards psychological side of investing. As we all know, emotions as such are significant part of investing world. I am rather new to the market, have been following closely and investing stock markets for the last 5 years. I love this world, all the variety, I enjoy participating in the community, the route from company discovery, through research of different business models, making my own economic analysis/predictions to eventually opening stock position, following the outcome of my decision etc. I honestly take a lot of enjoyment from this world, even my failed decisions. 

We all have heard about cryptocurrencies, as did I for a while now, heard about it from here and there, but I never really paid much attention to this world, as I honestly considered currencies significantly different world from stocks. Honestly, for a significant time I also believed crypto to be something of a ponzy scheme, a bubble, which will pop eventually. 
Lately I have done more research and honestly I have changed my mind significantly. It is impossible to say, where crypto might be heading, where the total market cap grows or if it will pop tomorrow, but that is not the point of my post. Anyway after some research I have invested about 6-7% of my portfolio value into the cryptocurrencies that I believe to have bright future. I am risk-averse and will not put any higher percent into currencies, however looking back a year, at those market caps, i would have likely added significantly higher percent of my portfolio.

Now to the psychological aspect of my post. With the volatility and popularity of crypto, one can imagine my position has done 100%+ returns in less than month, does not take genius to reach this. As everyone know, this is nothing compared to current crypto market situation, those entering crypto market about year earlier, returns of (tens of) thousands of percents are normal or common (just as an example, if one would have thrown equal amount into top 10 market cap crypto currencies one would already have few thousand percent gains in one year). Not to mention the biggest gainers by far, we have all heard about the famous 10 000 bitcoin pizza purchase, which would yield 100 000 000% rate of return. History has shown all kind of asset bubbles throughout history: dot com bubble, housing bubble latest, to those from the past such as South Sea Bubble and Dutch Tulip bubble. There were big winners with the right timing, but with such events, most investors eventually lost majority or all. These asset bubbles were big, but what we are currently seeing in the crypto currency world are those asset bubbles on steroids, and even this does not describe the insanity. In my mind this is unprecedented event, the fold increases markets have never seen, nothing really compares to current situation. I do not want to call it a bubble, as honestly I do not know where this insanity is heading, when it might pop or if it ever will. Perhaps it will grow into 1 trillion market before correcting 50%, which would still leave current investors big winners by far. My problem with this all is that even that 100% gain with less than month is by far higher rate of returns than classical stock investments reach in perhaps 4-5 years. Honestly I can not shake the thought of how being year earlier, I would have seen returns higher than I will likely achieve in the next 20 years on the stock market. I am well aware of the hindsight bias and the fact that I would have likely cashed out if I have achieved close to few hundred percent gains, but what IF I wouldnt? I am honestly disappointed in myself and each returns on classical stock markets are “ruined” by the returns I woulda-shoulda-coulda done on the cryptocurrency markets. It seems I missed once in a lifetime opportunity, as this really is unprecedented thing we are seeing. 

I need to somehow shake this, let it go, forget or accept, investing fellows, how are you making sense of this situation in your mind? I would be really thankful for your answers, as this is honestly bothering my rather much, more than it should perhaps.

TL:DR I feel like I missed once in a lifetime opportunity in terms of potential financial gains from crytocurrencies. Also seeing cryptocurrency market rate of returns has somewhat ruined the enjoyment I get from rate of returns from classical stock markets.

Thanks for your input, thoughts and advice in this matter.

77,2017-09-01,sana128,1,"What will we see first: Dow 30,000 or bitcoin $30,000?","U.S. stocks have been enjoying a strong run this year—over the past several years, really—but it’s nothing like the gains that have been seen in digital currencies. The moves in the latter have been so dramatic that it seems reasonable to ask: what will come first, Dow 30,000 or bitcoin at $30,000? [Chart](http://ei.marketwatch.com//Multimedia/2017/09/01/Photos/ZH/MW-FT548_djia_b_20170901101416_ZH.jpg?uuid=d6c466f2-8f1f-11e7-83e8-9c8e992d421e)
Those targets would represent vastly different growth stories. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.38%  is currently trading around 22,000, meaning it would need to rise about 36.5% to hit that milestone. Bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.78% meanwhile, is at about $4,890, making for a considerably steeper mountain to scale. It would need to advance more than 500%, or rise by a factor of six.

Is that an insurmountable hurdle? With bitcoin it can be hard to tell. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been on a blinding rally lately: over the past 12 months it has soared more than 700%—a repeat of that over the next 12 would be enough to cross the finish line. In 2017 so far it has gained more than 400%, and it nearly doubled in the month of August alone. Those sharp gains, however, have come with some equally sharp pullbacks, and because bitcoin lacks the traditional valuation metrics of stocks, a target of $300 is arguably just as plausible as $30,000.

Such gains are rare in any kind of investment vehicle, and charges that bitcoin is in a bubble have dogged the $80.6 billion digital currency for ages. Aaron Lasher, co-founder of Breadwallet, recently said that “this bull market will likely be followed by a pretty brutal bear market,” though he added that the currency’s market cap could reach $5 trillion over the next 10 years. That is trillion with a T—meaning it would boast a market capitalization bigger than any company in history, ever, one several times the current size of Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.02% The total combined market cap of all digital currencies is currently $176.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, a pricing website.

CHICAGO, Oct. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group, the world's leading and most diverse derivatives marketplace, today announced it intends to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter of 2017, pending all relevant regulatory review periods.

The new contract will be cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) which serves as a once-a-day reference rate of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin.  Bitcoin futures will be listed on and subject to the rules of CME.

""Given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets, we have decided to introduce a bitcoin futures contract,"" said Terry Duffy, CME Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  ""As the world's largest regulated FX marketplace, CME Group is the natural home for this new vehicle that will provide investors with transparency, price discovery and risk transfer capabilities.""

Since November 2016, CME Group and Crypto Facilities Ltd. have calculated and published the BRR, which aggregates the trade flow of major bitcoin spot exchanges during a calculation window into the U.S. Dollar price of one bitcoin as of 4:00 p.m. London time. The BRR is designed around the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks. Bitstamp, GDAX, itBit and Kraken are the constituent exchanges that currently contribute the pricing data for calculating the BRR.

""We are excited to work with CME Group on this product and see the BRR used as the settlement mechanism of this important product,"" said Dr.Timo Schlaefer, CEO of Crypto Facilities. ""The BRR has proven to reliably and transparently reflect global bitcoin-dollar trading and has become the price reference of choice for financial institutions, trading firms and data providers worldwide.""

CME Group and Crypto Facilities Ltd. also publish the CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index (BRTI) to provide price transparency to the spot bitcoin market.  The BRTI combines global demand to buy and sell bitcoin into a consolidated order book and reflects the fair, instantaneous U.S. dollar price of bitcoin in a spot price. The BRTI is published in real time and is suitable for marking portfolios, executing intra-day bitcoin transactions and risk management.

Cryptocurrency market capitalization has grown in recent years to $172 billion, with bitcoin representing more than 54 percent of that total, or $94 billion.  The bitcoin spot market has also grown to trade roughly $1.5 billion in notional value each day.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/spencerbogart/2017/10/08/the-trend-that-is-increasing-the-urgency-of-owning-bitcoin-and-ethereum/#3cb4fe02116b


Anybody who has been following cryptocurrency at all this year has learned two important things: 


1: The success of the ICO model in raising funds for new startups (a couple billion dollars)


2: The extreme levels of speculation inherent to the cryptocurrency markets as evidenced by some of these ICOs.


Another way to distribute a new token/coin: Simply give it out to people who already own another cryptocurrency at a specific moment in time. There have been a few examples of this over time and it is certainly not a new idea: Clamcoin and Auroracoin are two. For example (hypothetical), on December 3, 2017 at 12 PM EST everybody who owns ethereum will automatically receive one hablamanos2 token for each ethereum they own.


Almost all cryptocurrency startups are currently using the ICO model because of how much capital they can raise. But what happens when we combine these two methods? Now i will still give out one token for every ethereum you own, but I will also keep 10 million of these tokens for myself.


Based on how speculative the cryptocurrency markets are, I know that even if these tokens are completely meaningless and arbitrary, speculators will see to it that the price remains above zero provided it is traded on an exchange. Now I can sell off some of the 10 million coins i kept for myself and raise some actual money.


Instead of making the coins completely arbitrary, how about i actually use the funds i raised from selling the 10 million coins to start a business that will hopefully be able to pay back dividends to all token holders? Maybe i will raise $500k and start my empire of fourplexes and pay back the dividends to token holders. Set up a website/whitepaper like a traditional ICO and you can still raise a lot of money off a good idea.


So imagine this: You are a holder of Bitcoin or Ethereum. This hybrid Airdop/ICO model takes off and every month 50 new companies try the same thing. Each month you are receiving all these tokens that (hopefully) represent interest in new companies. Most probably will not, but maybe some of them will and will do very well. You automatically have a stake in each of them so you do not mind speculators funding them. In fact you prefer the speculators making a market so you can just blindly sell all of them off every month if you want. (Hopefully with decentralized exchanges that do not even need to list the coin to trade it... ie, imagine when you create a new coin it comes with a special ID that you can use to trade that coin on the decentralized exchange). If you decide not to sell the random tokens, you will hopefully start to receive dividends in the form of Bitcoin/Ethereum from the companies that do well. Doesn't this entire thing start to sound like a normal dividend paid out to Bitcoin/Ethereum holders?


And here is what could lead to a huge speculate mania: This new dynamic that introduces this thing that looks like a dividend makes Bitcoin/Ethereum act like a normal investment because there is some sort of cash flow associated with it. Maybe multiple layers of speculation with a dash of hope, but still a cash flow. All of a sudden Bitcoin/Ethereum receive a lot of additional demand pushing prices higher. The market becomes more speculative and the value of the dividend rises, perhaps very rapidly as profits start chasing more risky investments (IE the airdrop/ICO combos). Which just makes Bitcoin/Ethereum seem cheaper, and go up more. We have a positive feedback loop for a massive price rally, eventual bubble, huge collapse, etc. etc. but we get some truly strange new-age type of financial instrument in the process and turn bitcoin/ethereum into a dividend paying **investment**.


All it takes is a couple successful crowdfunding campaigns doing this and then everyone is in. You saw how fast ICOs became common-place this year. For a trade with a huge positive expected value, simply wait for this dynamic to set up and then buy crypto to hold for a few months. If the dynamic does not set up, don't buy any.


Thoughts? Crypto investors... did you already see this and I'm just late to this train of thinking? Damn, someday i will just go get drunk when i'm bored at night at a hostel... but i guess that day is not today =Z"

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-29/wild-bitcoin-ride-erases-2-200-in-five-hours-after-record-rally

&gt; Bitcoin plunged as much as 20 percent hours after a rally past $11,000 generated a surge in traffic at online exchanges that led to intermittent outages.

&gt; The plunge capped a wild day for the largest cryptocurrency that included a breakneck advance to a high of $11,434 before the reversal took it as low as $9,009. As of 3:36 p.m. in New York, it traded at $9,911.10, virtually unchanged from where it began the session.

&gt; The heaviest selling came amid reports of service outages and delays on some of the largest online exchanges. The extent of the problems on platforms such as Coinbase and Gemini remained unclear, with several saying massive spikes in traffic had caused unspecified problems. Coinbase remained unavailable to some users.

&gt; Bitcoin had rallied 20 percent in just four days, topping $10,000 for the first time earlier this week in a runup that drew increased warnings it was in a bubble. The cryptocurrency ended September at $4,171.25.

This might be a buying opportunity if you don't mind volatility. Definitely no guarantees though. I do not currently own any bitcoin or have plans to buy any. "

First off, something about me and why I post this here. I'm computer science student and I got to learn about cryptocurrencies about a year ago. When I learned what Bitcoin was and how it worked, it literally blew my mind. It's a very weird feeling. I've been following the space since then.

Lately, the speculation side of cryptocurrency somehow also brought me here and got me interested in stocks. That is maybe a little weird as I suspect that's usually the other way around; either people from traditional investing are attracted by the high volatility in crypto or people like me who never invested in traditional markets learn about crypto and are not interested in stocks because they are used to much higher returns due to their lack of experience and the recent crypto bull run.

However, today I am not making this post because of the speculation aspect of Bitcoin. I know that people here have very mixed feelings about Bitcoin and that is understandable. I know that there are many smart people here and maybe some of you can benefit from the video which I have seen yesterday.

Andreas Antonopoulos obtained his degree in Computer Science and Data Communications and Distributed Systems from the University College London. He has been involved with network security for about 20 years, working for different corporations. When he discovered Bitcoin, he started to work on it full-time and is since also teaching about it. He is my favorite person when it comes to educating about Bitcoin, I have never seen better talks from someone on this topic.

In 2014, the senate of canada invited him to inform them about Bitcoin and advise them on how to regulate it. The conversation has been recorded and is available on YouTube. I couldn't move for two hours, the conversation was too exciting for me. I hope someone here can enjoy this and maybe benefit from it.

117,2017-11-16,[deleted],0,Is the cryptocurrency market a zero-sum game?,"I've been pondering this a lot lately. At first I thougt that cryptocurrency trading/investing wasn't a zero-sum game. The reasoning behind this is that I saw cryptocurrency's overall market cap increase. As demand increases, prices rise, and everybody holding crypto would gain. Even day traders would gain more often than they lose.

Then I thought about opportinity cost: player X sells his bitcoin, which he got for $10, at a rate of $100 to player Y, making a 90 dollar profit. Then player Z, which sold for $10, has lost $90 in opportunity cost, because he could have held the bitcoin and sold it for $100. This doesn't add up though, because in the end, more net store of value is created, because player Z got the bitcoin for $1 maybe, everyone's making a profit in dollars.

If the utility of crypto is merely as a store of value, and every player is just trying to increase their store of value,  then it must be a zero-sum game, right? But if only value is gained, where is it lost?

Than something dawned on me: as the demand of crypto (as a store of value) rises, then demand of fiat money (as a store of value) declines. Meaning that the winnings in the crypto market (your coin being worth more) is offset by the losses in the fiat market (your fiat money is worth less).

Since the value and amount held of fiat money far eclipses the value and amount held of crypto, the losses in the fiat market are more spread out, while the gains in the crypto market are more concentrated. 

Example: 10 players hold 1 dollar and 10 players hold 10 bitcoins. 1 bitcoin equals 1 dollar, but due to changes in supply and demand the value of bitcoin rises relative to the dollar, making 1 bitcoin worth 1.10 dollar. The bitcoin holders win, the dollar holders lose.

Thoughts about this? Am I missing something?"

Will the Market Crash?,"The Housing Market Crash from 2007-2008 forever scarred both the domestic and international markets in one of the greatest failures both attributable to the financial institutions that provided the means for the crisis and the public who fueled the madness. 

Currently, we are enjoying one of the greatest bull runs of our lifetimes and both strong consumer spending and credit bolstered by strong company fundamentals are continuing to drive the markets to consistent all-time highs. So bullish is this market that countless shorts are getting eviscerated in this massive run as the rest of the global economy continues to rise as well. Even Japan, who had suffered decades of stagnant economic growth, is now beginning to gain back some of its strength back through strong economic strides. 

As Fed Chair Janet Yellen steps down, fellow board member Jerome Powell will be taking her place which is good for the markets as both share similar views. This continuation in the markets is a mark of consistency that will continue Yellen's work in the past which has helped the markets to recover. With all these factors in place, there is strong evidence to suggest that there is still yet more room for the markets to grow even at these all-time high levels. 

Bitcoin is emerging as the top contender for the next bubble and is represented as a significant risk to the markets. Although the valuation of Bitcoin is a little absurd, the cryptocurrency alongside others are not integrated enough with both society and the economy due to the lack of practical use for Bitcoin at this point in time. Considering that many still do not use payments (or even know what it is) in addition to the fact that most businesses do not accept Bitcoin payment, even if Bitcoin were to collapse, the current situation hints that Bitcoin will not be the bubble, at least not now.

Overall, the markets are enjoying a time of great prosperity and a renewed revival of the investment community. Although there are many caution signs to be aware of, being out of the markets completely is not the right option either. 

What do you guys think? "
120,2017-11-14,rustykatz,0,HIVE Blockchain Technology,"As of late, Hive (the largest crypto currency mining company) has entered into a very bearish market. Hive is still the first publicly traded cryptocurrency miner in Canada and has set records for trading volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). They are also a cash flow positive company, which is quite a rare thing considering how new they are. We must also consider the fact that they are poised for expansion in Sweden with a new state of the art data mining facility which is scheduled to be completed in March 2018. The new center will utilize custom-designed mining rigs built by Genesis. It should be noted that the center will be completed in 2 separate phases, of which phase 1 will be completed in December 2017. Each phase is expected to represent approximately 6.8 MW of electricity consumption for a total of 13.6 MW in Sweden. This dwarfs Hive’s current operating facilities which only represent 3.8 MW in electricity consumption. 

Hive itself has also not sold any of its mined crypto currency coins, and currently holds large quantities of Ethereum and ZCash. Why haven’t they sold any of mined cryptos? This is because according to Hive’s co-founder Oliver Roussy Newton, Hive has the adequate capital and doesn’t need to trade its crypto portfolio to finance itself. 


Thoughts on the future of the company?

EDIT : I was wrong that Hive has not sold any of its mined crypto, in order for it to be cash flow positive they must have sold just enough to cover expenses while saving the rest as investments. "

So does anyone have any advice for me to adopt? My patience for stocks and real estate has been much better but I find I check the price of crypto a bit much... I also pick single stocks instead of succumbing to mutual funds, though I’m considering grabbing some ETF’s I’ve been eyeing.

I know my question may not be clearest but I’m just trying to see how solid investors operate on the day-to-day. Frequency of checking performance? How often to fund/invest? I get paid bi-weekly, is small investments every two weeks ineffective? What stats do you value/watch more closely? Etc. thanks in advance!

128,2017-11-04,SaltyDanny,7,New to investing with questions,"I'm brand spanking new to investing having read a couple of books on the subject and I came up with a couple of questions that I'm hoping could be answered here. 

For those of you who use Stash is it a good starting point? 

If investing in stocks I hear the Dow J and S&amp;P 500 are good places to invest in since they seem to always recover after a correction or bear market. Is that true? Is there better?

If I was going to start investing on my own without a financial advisor or brokerage firm how do I go about that if it's even possible? And if not what's a good firm/organization to minimize fees. (Currently investing with creative planning)

Should I wait for a bear market or correction to start going into the market and buy stocks for cheaper to gain a profit? Should I start now regardless because it's not clear when one of those will happen?

And the last one: I've heard from numerous people that gold/silver and cryptocurrency are either not worth it's value or in the case for cryptocurrency too volatile is there a good substitute?

Again I'm brand new and any input would be amazing I'm just trying to wrap my head around this seemingly high skill ceiling in investing smartly

Yes I'm going to ask you about cryptos but it's a technical question that applies to any market. And that is, how do I find out the actual cash flow of national currencies into bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency?

In other words the market cap is just the price of the last transaction times the number of outstanding coins or shares. But it could just be two guys sitting in a room selling the same pencil to each other to push up the price of pencils. There does't need to be very much actual money flowing into the system to push up the market cap.  And in the case of bitcoin there are plenty of good reasons to question the integrity of the market. 

How do I find out how much actual money has moved from the fiat to the crypto world?"

I am however considering waiting for a dip (that might never come) I bought btc for $400 here the other day for $16k, but I don't see any indication that there is a downfall pretty soon for the cryptomarket. Is it going to hit hard and unexpectedly or gradually just decrease in price? I know this depends on a lot of things in the outside world, so it isn't easy to make a guess. The currencies I'm currently thinking about investing into is BTC, LTC and XRP, maybe ethereum as well, but most of my funds will be stored in btc. I know this is all speculation and there is no way anyone can tell with certainty the outcome of these coins, but I know there's a lot of people here with tons of experience within cryptocurrency, and I'm hoping someone can give me an educated guess as to what I should do. I just want to see some different opinions and mindsets before making up my mind. Do you think this is a bad time to invest? Is there a high probability that there will be a huge dip soon before things starts moving up again? XRP has gone up insane amounts lately so in my experience it will drop and stabalize before it starts moving again.

Appreciate the inputs alot!"

""I think what viewers have to appreciate is, this is a millennial story,"" Fundstrat's Lee said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""The average millennial is 25 today. The boomers were 25 in 1982, so what did the boomers drive from 1982 to the peak population of the boomers, which was '99? The S&amp;P 500.""

""Millennials have great interest in digital businesses, social media and bitcoin,"" Lee said, adding that ""the millennial population is not going to peak until 2040.""

Lee was chief equity strategist at JPMorgan before co-founding Fundstrat in 2014. He is the only major strategist on Wall Street to issue price targets for bitcoin and expects the digital currency to hit $11,500 by the middle of next year and $25,000 by year 2022.



Source: Deutsche Bank

The S&amp;P 500 has climbed more than 18 percent this year to record highs, while bitcoin has surged 1,700 percent to above $17,000. Major exchanges such as Cboe and CME are vying to launch bitcoin derivatives products, which could allow institutional investors to buy into the cryptocurrency trend and pave the way for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

An October survey found 27 percent of millennials would prefer to invest in $1,000 of bitcoin versus the same amount of stocks. Harris Poll conducted the online survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults on behalf of cryptocurrency venture capital firm Blockchain Capital.

However, CNBC also reported in October that Vlad Tenev, the co-founder of stock trading app Robinhood, expects stocks to stay in favor. At the time, about 78 percent of Robinhood's more than 2 million customers fall into the so-called millennial category, those ages 18 to 35."

2018 will be a true roller coaster ride compared to an outrageously placid 2017

Saxo Bank, the online multi-asset trading and investment specialist, has today released its 10 'Outrageous Predictions' for 2018. The predictions focus on a series of unlikely but underappreciated events which, if they were to occur, could send shockwaves across financial markets.

While these predictions do not constitute Saxo’s official market forecasts for 2018, they represent a warning of a potential misallocation of risk among investors who typically see just a one percent likelihood to these events materialising.

Commenting on this year’s Outrageous Predictions, Chief Economist at Saxo Bank, Steen Jakobsen said:

“We have published Outrageous Predictions for more than 10 years and think this year’s list is one of the best we ever had, encouraging everyone to think outside the consensus box. It is important to underline that the Outrageous Predictions should not be considered Saxo’s official market outlook, it is instead the events and market moves deemed outliers with huge potentials for upsetting consensus views.”

Head of FX Strategy, John J. Hardy, who lead the project this year, commented:

""A year ago, many thought 2017 would prove a volatile year, given the seemingly impossible rise of Trump and the shock of Brexit. Instead, we got a year of outrageously smooth sailing that inflated risky assets the world around with nary a storm. But in 2018 we see the pendulum swinging back in favour of pronounced volatility risks as the irony of long periods of quiet and complacency in asset markets is that they sow the seeds for future volatility as investors underestimate tail risks and overleverage their bets on a continuation of the cycle.”

“That being said, our predictions this year aren’t just about market crash concerns. We wax outrageous on everything from major central banks losing their policy mojo and a new political crisis in the EU, to China eroding the US dollar's reserve currency status and a new political spring welling up in southern Africa. We may or may not get any of these right but that isn't the point. Rather, our task here is to stimulate debate and thought on what outrageous direction things may head at major inflection points like those that 2018 will inevitably bring. “

The [Outrageous Predictions 2018 publication is available here](https://www.home.saxo/campaigns/outrageous-predictions-2018) and the full list of Saxo Bank’s Outrageous Predictions for 2018 reads:

1. The Fed loses independence as the US Treasury takes charge
Both the Republicans and Democrats vie for an increased share of the populist vote as we head into 2018 mid-term elections, with budget discipline entirely absent and GOP tax cuts bringing a massive revenue shortfall which will worsen as US heads into recession. The weak economy and the higher interest rates and inflation will leave the Fed with no answer on monetary policy. The Fed becomes a scapegoat for the economy’s weak performance, a bond market in turmoil and worsening inequality. The Treasury takes on emergency powers and forces the central bank to cap US government yields to 2.5% on long bonds to prevent a bond market meltdown, a policy which was last in place in the immediate aftermath of World War II.

2. Bank of Japan forced to abandon yield curve control
The Bank of Japan’s policy of yield curve control depends on soft global interest rates and low yields, and in 2018 this centre will simply not hold. As inflation rises, yields too will spike, and the result will be a fantastical plunge in the yen. Ultimately, the central bank will need to resort to QE-style measures, but not before USDJPY hits 150, after which it rapidly devalues to 100.

3. China rolls out the Petro-Renminbi
China is by far the largest oil importer, and many producer nations are already more than happy to transact in yuan terms. With the US’ global power and reach waning, and given the success of CNY-based commodity futures in general, the Shanghai International Energy Exchange’s decision to launch a yuan-based crude oil future is a runaway success. The introduction of the petro-yuan sees CNY appreciate more than 10% versus the dollar, taking the USDCNY rate below 6.0 for the first time ever. 

4. Volatility spikes after flash crash in stock markets
World markets are increasingly full of signs and wonders, and the collapse of volatility seen across asset classes in 2017 was no exception. The historic lows in the VIX and MOVE indices are matched by record highs in stocks and real estate, and the result is a powder keg that is set to blow sky-high as the S&amp;P 500 loses 25% of its value in a rapid, spectacular, one-off move reminiscent of 1987. A whole swathe of short volatility funds are completely wiped out and a formerly unknown long volatility trader realises a 1000% gain and instantly becomes a legend.

5. US voters go hard left in 2018 election
Changing demographics in the US which already has the under-35 millennials in place as a larger cohort than the post-war baby boomers will have a dramatic impact on politics in 2018. The general revulsion of younger voters for Trump’s persona, the widening inequality gap aggravated even further by the Republicans’ cynical tax reform, and a new breed of Democratic candidates who are unafraid to tap into Sanders-style populism from the left sees millennials turning out in droves at the polls in November. The Democrats pull the debate away from tax reform to spending stimulus for the masses. True populism means breaking out the chequebook for the 90%, and that means fiscal stimulus, deficits be damned. US 30-year Treasury yields rip beyond 5%.

6. Austro-Hungarian empire threatens EU takeover
The divide between old core EU members and the more sceptical and newer members of the bloc will widen to an impassable chasm in 2018 and for the first time since 1951, Europe’s political centre of gravity will shift from the Franco-German couple to CEE. The EU’s institutional blockage does not take long to worry financial markets. After spiking to new highs versus the G10 and many EM currencies by late in 2018, the euro rapidly weakens towards parity with USD.

7. Bitcoin is thrown to the wolves
Bitcoin peaks in 2018 above $60,000 and with a market capitalisation of over $1 trillion as the advent of the Bitcoin futures contract in December 2017 leads to a groundswell of involvement by investors and funds that are more comfortable trading futures than tying up funds on cryptocurrency exchanges. Before long, however, the Bitcoin phenomenon finds the rug torn out from under it as Russia and China move deftly to sideline and even prohibit non-sanctioned cryptocurrencies domestically. After its spectacular peak in 2018, Bitcoin crashes and limps into 2019 close to its fundamental “production cost” of $1,000.

8. Southern African Spring sees South Africa blossom
In 2018, after a surprising turn of events, a wave of democratic transition spreads across sub-Saharan Africa. The forced resignation of Zimbabwe’s long-term president Robert Mugabe at the end of 2017 triggers a wave of political change in other African countries. South Africa’s Jacob Zuma is forced out of power and Congo’s Joseph Kabila faces unprecedented demonstrations pushing him to flee the country. South Africa, however, is the main winner as the ZAR becomes the EM darling and returns 30% against the G3 currencies. It brings the world’s strongest rates of growth in South Africa and satellite frontier economies of the region.

9. Tencent topples Apple as market cap king
China, still the world’s most populous country and one with a rapidly rising standard of living, is opening up its capital markets and its reform programmes are driving a rise in investor sentiment. This is particularly evident in Chinese technology stocks with market leader Tencent’s shares rocketing 120% higher in 2017. In late 2017, Tencent moved into the global top five in market cap terms, nearing $500 billion and even eclipsing Facebook at one point. In 2018, though, Tencent leaves the other giants in the dust with its shares advancing another 100% despite the company’s already enormous size , stealing the world market cap crown from Apple at well above $1 trillion.

10. It’s their time – women crash the glass ceiling
Over the last generation, women have started achieving higher education levels than men, with US universities now graduating some 50% more women than men at the bachelor’s degree level. Women also now comprise nearly half of all business graduates. And yet in 2017, only 6.4% of the CEOs in the Fortune 500 list are women – though on average they earn more than their male peers. 
Change is coming – not because it is “fair”, but for the practical reason that women realising their desired potential is the last way left to grow the pie without growing the population in our low-productivity and aging developed economies. In 2018, the chauvinist old boys’ clubs are shaken to their core by shareholders and a woman occupies the top spot at more than 60 Fortune 500 companies by the end of the year."

172,2017-12-05,lulzcakes,0,Stupid Theory: NVDA and AMD will crash after Bitcoin Futures come out. Along with all other tech companies that rely on computer sales.,"**TL;DR:** BTC Futures —\&gt; BTC prices stabilize —\&gt; Holding coins becomes too risky for the now fewer gains —\&gt; Selling starts, leading to panic dumping —\&gt; Mining coins is now too expensive to be profitable —\&gt; Huge glut of used computers\/cards\/etc + much lower demand 

* When BTC Futures are released, the speculative nature of cryptocurrency will finally have a reliable derivative that can be used to either bet for or against large swings. 
* We will then see BTC volatility \(volatility specifically; not necessarily price\) go down a lot. This is because people, and especially institutional and big-money players, will no longer have to buy individual coins to lock in speculative gains. These individual coins also have a limit on how much you can realiably buy and sell in a single trade, whereas futures will not. 
* After BTC prices stabilize, we’ll see subsequent downward pressure on prices because no longer will BTC offer consistent 100&amp;#37; gains every month. And if it’s not offering 100&amp;#37;\/month, it’s not worth the risk. At that point, it would be better to play options with 2-3 month expiration dates as they would have much lower risk for the same amount of gains. 
* And once the realization settles in that BTC no longer offers huge gains every month, people will dump. And once people dump, prices will crash to nothing because cryptocurrencies don’t have any intrinsic value behind them.

Once Bitcoin crashes, we’re going to have an incredibly large glut of used computers, cards, and other stuff out on the market. Demand for these things will also die down as miners die off. This will all lead to a large drop in price for NVDA, AMD, INTC, MU, and other companies that rely on new computer sales for profit. "

Okay so I started making some money online. Not close enough to replace my 'real job'. Though know I wish to learn more about stocks and cryptocurrency investing.

As I'm still living with my parents I can save a lot of my 'real job' money about 80% of it is going straight to the bank so that I can buy a home in maybe 3-5 more years without a loan. I don't wish to touch this money.

Though with the money I'm making online, I wish to start investing all of it on stocks and cryptocurrency. I don't wish to go to a school as I find school's waste so much time on useless information. I learn way faster from researching online. I mean a year ago I didn't even have a facebook account let alone make my own websites and sell stuff online. Know I'm already making some extra dough online.

Anyways as I know of reddit now which I didn't a year ego and all the experienced people here. Would anyone suggest me with reliable youtubers/bloggers/etc. That I can start reading to get a basic concept on investing.

Cheers guys."
