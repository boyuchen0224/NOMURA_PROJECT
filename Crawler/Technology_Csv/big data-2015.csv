0,2015-01-24,stratosmacker,9,Would anyone be interested in a consumer sentiment data service?,"About a month ago, a friend and I had the idea to scrape various social media, news sources, reddit, etc, and using various machine learning algorithms, create a database of consumer sentiment for different companies and market segments over time.

If (big if), we created a useful and comprehensive API and website, would anyone be interested in using it? Right now we are trying to gague interest in such a product, and that's more or less the purpose of this post.

If you have any questions or somewhat unrelated comments, feel free to ask and be critical."
1,2015-01-23,getithot,209,Best Books for Investors - long read,"Every couple of days there's a new post about books for investors. One of the better columnist over at the WSJ - Jason Zweig - put out the following list before Thanksgiving and I thought it would be helpful for those looking for some reading material. There are a couple books you'll recognize, but also many underrated titles. 

**Gary Belsky and Thomas Gilovich, [Why Smart People Make Big Money Mistakes and How to Correct Them](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439163367?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1439163367&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

In clear, simple prose, Belsky and Gilovich explain some of the most common quirks that cause people to make foolish financial decisions. If you read this book, you should be able to recognize most of them in yourself and have a fighting chance of counteracting some of them. Otherwise, you will end up learning about your cognitive shortcomings the hard way: at the Wall Street campus of the School of Hard Knocks.

**Peter L. Bernstein, [Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471295639?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0471295639&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

The late polymath Peter Bernstein poured a long lifetime of erudition and insight into this intellectual history of risk, luck, probability and the problems of trying to forecast what the future holds. Combining a stupendous depth of research with some of the most elegant prose ever written about finance, Bernstein chronicles the halting human march toward a better understanding of risk—and reminds us that, after centuries of progress, we still have a long way to go.

**John C. Bogle, [Common Sense on Mutual Funds](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470138130?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0470138130&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

The founder of the Vanguard Group and father of the index-fund industry methodically sorts fact from fiction. Following his logical arguments can benefit you even if you never invest in a mutual fund, since Bogle touches on just about every crucial aspect of investing, including taxes, trading costs, diversification, performance measurement and the power of patience.

**Elroy Dimson, [Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton, Triumph of the Optimists](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691091943?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0691091943&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

Neither light reading nor cheap (it’s hard to find online for less than about $75), this book is the most thoughtful and objective analysis of the long-term returns on stocks, bonds, cash and inflation available anywhere, purged of the pom-pom waving and statistical biases that contaminate other books on the subject. The sober conclusion here: Stocks are likely, although not certain, to be the highest-performing asset over the long run. But if you overpay at the top of a bull market, your future returns on stocks will probably be poor.

**Richard Feynman, [Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393316041?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0393316041&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20) or [What Do You Care What Other People Think?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393320928?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0393320928&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

These captivating oral histories of the great Nobel Prize-winning physicist ostensibly have nothing to do with investing. In my view, however, the three qualities an investor needs above all others are independence, skepticism and emotional self-control. Reading Feynman’s recollections of his career of intellectual discovery, you’ll see how hard he worked at honing his skepticism and learning to think for himself. You’ll also be inspired to try emulating him in your own way.

**Benjamin Graham, [The Intelligent Investor](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060555661?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0060555661&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

Originally published in 1949, called by Warren Buffett “by far the best book on investing ever written,” this handbook covers far more than just how to determine how much a company’s stock is worth. Graham discusses how to allocate your capital across stocks and bonds, how to analyze mutual funds, how to take inflation into account, how to think wisely about risk and, especially, how to understand yourself as an investor. After all, as Graham wrote, “the investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.” (Disclosure: I edited the 2003 revised edition and receive a royalty on its sales.) Advanced readers can move on to Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, Security Analysis, the much longer masterpiece upon which The Intelligent Investor is based.

**Darrell Huff, [How to Lie with Statistics](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393310728?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0393310728&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

This puckish riff on how math can be manipulated is only 142 pages; most people could read it on a train ride or two, or in an afternoon at the beach. As light as the book is, however, it is nevertheless profound. In one short take after another, Huff picks apart the ways in which marketers use statistics, charts, graphics and other ways of presenting numbers to baffle and trick the public. The chapter “How to Talk Back to a Statistic” is a brilliant step-by-step guide to figuring out how someone is trying to deceive you with data.

**Daniel Kahneman, [Thinking, Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533555?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0374533555&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

Successful investing isn’t about outsmarting the next guy, but rather about minimizing your own stupidity. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who shared the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2oo2, probably understands how the human mind works better than anyone else alive. This book can make you think more deeply about how you think than you ever thought possible. As Kahneman would be the first to say, that can’t inoculate you completely against your own flaws. But it can’t hurt, and it might well help. (Disclosure: I helped Kahneman research, write and edit the book, although I don’t earn any royalties from it.)

**Charles P. Kindleberger, [Manias, Panics, and Crashes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0230365353?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0230365353&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

In this classic, first published in 1978, the late financial economist Charles Kindleberger looks back at the South Sea Bubble, Ponzi schemes, banking crises and other mass disturbances of purportedly efficient markets. He explores the common features of market disruptions as they build and burst. If you remember nothing from the book other than Kindleberger’s quip, “There is nothing so disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich,” you are ahead of the game.

**Roger Lowenstein, [Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812979273?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0812979273&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

This book remains the most comprehensive and illuminating study of Warren Buffett’s investing and analytical methods, covering his career in remarkable detail up until the mid-1990s. If you read it in conjunction with Alice Schroeder’s The Snowball, you will have a fuller grasp on what makes the world’s greatest investor tick.

**Burton G. Malkiel, [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393246116?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0393246116&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

In this encyclopedic and lively book, Malkiel, a finance professor at Princeton University, bases his judgments on rigorous and objective analysis of long-term data. The first edition, published in 1973, is widely credited with helping foster the adoption of index funds. The latest edition casts a skeptical eye on technical analysis, “smart beta” and other market fashions.

**Bertrand Russell, [Sceptical Essays or The Scientific Outlook](Sceptical Essays or The Scientific Outlook)**

Russell is Buffett’s favorite philosopher, and these short essay collections show why. Russell wrote beautifully and thought with crystalline clarity. Immersing yourself in his ideas will sharpen your own skepticism. My favorite passage: “When a man tells you that he knows the exact truth about anything, you are safe in inferring that he is an inexact man…. It is an odd fact that subjective certainty is inversely proportional to objective certainty. The less reason a man has to suppose himself in the right, the more vehemently he asserts that there is no doubt whatever that he is exactly right.” Think about that the next time a financial adviser begins a sentence with the words “Studies have proven that….”

**Alice Schroeder, [The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553384619?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0553384619&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

With unprecedented access to Buffett, Schroeder crafted a sensitive, personal and insightful profile, focusing even more on him as a person than as an investor—and detailing the remarkable sacrifices he made along the way. If you read it alongside Lowenstein’s Buffett, you will have an even deeper understanding of the master.

**Fred Schwed, [Where Are the Customers’ Yachts?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471770892?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0471770892&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

First published in 1940, this is the funniest book ever written about investing—and one of the wisest. Schwed, a veteran of Wall Street who survived the Crash of 1929, knew exactly how the markets worked back then. Nothing has changed. Turning to any page at random, you will find gleefully sarcastic observations that ring at least as true today as they did three-quarters of a century ago. My favorite: “At the end of the day [fund managers] take all the money and throw it up in the air. Everything that sticks to the ceiling belongs to the clients.”

**“Adam Smith,"" [The Money Game](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394721039?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=0394721039&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;tag=stockpucker-20)**

In the late 1960s, the stock market was dominated by fast-talking, fast-trading young whizzes. The former money manager George J.W. Goodman, who wrote under the pen name “Adam Smith,” christened them “gunslingers.” In this marvelously entertaining book, Goodman skewers the pretensions, guesswork and sheer hogwash of professional money management. Reading his mockery can help sharpen your own skepticism toward the next great new investing idea—which almost certainly will turn out to be neither great nor new.

3,2015-01-21,[deleted],0,Who 'owns' stock market trade/price data?,"So I've been looking into various data sources for running simulations on trading algorithms, obviously the market for trade/financial data is massive and the quality, configurability, normalization, and throughput of different data providers varies massively and I understand that I'll need to pay a decent amount of money for anything other than daily closing data of currently active stocks.

So here's my question, in two parts.

1) If I wanted to know what the current price of a stock is on some big exchange like NYSE or NASDAQ, what is the __primary__ source of that data? 

2) When it comes to data primary sources, what is their copyright policy on stock data?"
4,2015-02-25,AiresGRC,1,An Investment Tool That Uses AI to Simulate Markets and Predict Their Next Move,"http://bit.ly/1AJYT9P

Nowadays investing in the stock market seems to be all about competing over pennies at sub-millisecond speed, requiring huge upfront investments in low-latency technology, in what is known as High-Frequency Trading. At the other end of the extreme, ordinary people are using mobile investing apps to simply automatically invest small amounts in passive index funds. Little attention however is going to approaches that actually aim to predict market movements by taking advantage of fundamental market inefficiencies. This is surprising, given today’s advances in artificial intelligence, big data and available computing power.

One such attempt though is made by Altreva, a company that specializes in financial time series forecasting and market modeling. Their Adaptive Modeler software uses evolutionary computing and simulation technology to create evolving market models that predict market movements.

What are your thoughts on this topic?"
5,2015-02-23,MMYourWay,1,Women Into Investing Part II: PF Bloggers,"There are a lot of great blogs out there that go into detail about how to invest and some of them even share what’s in their own personal portfolio.

However, one thing I noticed was that the people who mostly talked about investing in detail were guys. I have yet to find a blog focused solely on investing written by a female. If you know of one, please msg me or email me with the link!

So I decided to ask some of my favourite female pf bloggers what their thoughts were on women and investing. I asked them to share their thoughts about women and investing in general and/or answer one or both of the following questions:

1. What advice would you give to female investors?

2. What do you think are some reasons why women don’t invest in their finances?

In no particular order, here are their responses:

 

Anne from Money Propeller

1. Get out there and learn!  Start with index funds or ETFs, you can even stick with them forever if you would like.   Look up a fee only adviser and go talk to one, then think about what they said.  Ask some friends for their opinions, ask some forums for their opinions and then do what feels right for your situation.  
2. I think a lot of women are intimidated and women are more risk averse than men, so don’t tend to charge in with a cavalier attitude.  It’s really unfortunate, because there are a lot of great resources out there, including local folks. 
 

Sherry (saverspender) from Save. Spend. Splurge.

Don’t think you’re not smart enough or need to be very mathematically inclined to be able to invest, like holding a PhD in mathematics or something.
 

I am not a mathematically inclined person but I asked tons of questions no matter how dumb I sounded to understand as much as I could; to be honest I still don’t know what some of the more complex investing terms mean but they’re irrelevant for a regular investor like you and me; you don’t need to be an investment banker to invest your money.
 

If you don’t understand something then it means it is not being explained to you in a simple enough manner.
 

I recommend getting a list of beginner investing books to read (have a list on my blog @www.savespendsplurge.com/the-only-personal-finance-books-you-should-ever-have-to-read-in-your-life/ ) and avoid thinking that investing means knowing how to pick the next hot stock. 
Investing is simply learning how to manage your money so that it grows and that includes passive investing like putting your money in index funds (what I do with the bulk of my cash).
 

Women are afraid of investing because they are paralyzed by being aware that they don’t know anything and they’re scared of making a mistake and losing all their money. None of this applies if you follow an investing strategy that works for your level of risk and investing knowledge.Please don’t use your sex as an excuse either because TRUST ME, men do not have the monopoly on being able to understand money management in all of its aspects – there are plenty of clueless guys out there who are guessing and pretending to be savvy investors which is even worse than admitting you’re clueless.
 

Know what you don’t know and start learning a bit at a time by asking questions.
 
 
women can invest
Vintage image of Rosie the Riveter by J. Howard Miller.

Pauline from Reach Financial Independence

My advice for female investors is just to get started, for example index funds are very simple to manage, and you can have an automatic transfer on pay-day directly into your investment accounts to dollar cost average and have the opportunity to keep on buying more if prices drop. Just forget about it and watch it grow!
 

For me the reason women don’t invest too much in their finances is because financial education is poor in general, and if you have always relied on your parents or significant other, you don’t feel it is too important to care for yourself. But you never know what can happen, you could end up single again, with kids and a household to take care of, so I can’t insist enough on the importance of getting started.
 

Bridget from Money After Graduation

To be honest, I’m not sure why women don’t invest or invest differently than men. Money doesn’t care what your gender is. The stock market isn’t going to treat you differently whether you’re a man or a woman.  I think the lack of confident female investors is a symptom of larger problems — the fact that women often earn less than their male counterparts in the same profession, or the myth that women aren’t as good as men at math. The advice I would give female investors is the same as that I would give male investors: start early, be diligent, and remember less is more when it comes to trading frequency!
 

Taylor from Engineer Cents

1. I think many women don’t invest because they are risk averse, at least when compared to their male counterparts. They talk themselves down, don’t think they are “good with numbers” or have enough experience to get into it. And so they don’t, which is a shame because by fearing loss, they end up falling behind anyway because of factors like inflation.
 

2. Start small and use target funds through a provider like Vanguard if you’re a beginner, or choose an investment vehicle you are most comfortable with. But whatever you do, start! Also, keep in mind that at some point in your investing lifetime, you will lose money; don’t sell while the market is down! Remember that averaged out over a long period of time you will more than likely come out ahead.
 

Sarah from Unsettle

1. There is a lot to learn about investing but don’t let not being an expert hold you back from investing your first dollar. It’s easy to fall victim to analysis paralysis in investing and sometimes the best way to learn is in the trenches. 
 

2. I think a lot of it is that people in generally – and maybe especially women – think they don’t know enough and assume that the learning curve is quite high. 
 

Also, studies show that women tend to be a bit more risk averse than men. 
 

Alicia from Financial Diffraction

As a late 20’s woman, I started investing because of a mandatory retirement plan through my employer. I had read about investing before, but I was stuck in an analysis paralysis loop, where I wanted everything to be perfect before I put my money in the market rather than getting a basic investing education and then learning more as I went along – I wanted to be an expert overnight. From talking to my female friends, I think the fear of the unknown, feeling like we’re not fully in control, and that everything requires perfection really hinders women from making the jump from saving money to investing. It doesn’t have to be perfect. Educate yourself on index investing, and throw your money in a low-cost index fund while you learn the more complex issues; if by the end of your investing education you’re still not comfortable with more than the “set it and forget it” mentality of indexing, that’s fine, but you won’t have put off your investing for another few years while you try to get everything “perfect”.
 

Michelle from Making Sense of Cents

1. My advice would be to just start investing. Even if all you have is $100 to invest, it is important to start as it can quickly become addicting to watch your investments grow. Everyone has to start somewhere, right? That first step can feel hard, but once you overcome it you will realize that investing is not so scary.
 

 
2. I think a big reason for why women don’t invest is because the first step of investing that I mentioned earlier can feel so scary. Investing can seem so foreign if you’ve never done it before, and that can feel very overwhelming.
 

 Mel from brokeGIRLrich

1. I think part of the issues is to just do it. Do some research, decide how much you’re going to invest and then get it done. If you select a solid company, odds are good you’ll do fine. Or forget about companies altogether and invest in index funds or target date funds. At the end of the day, you’ll always wish you started something that was good for you yesterday. You might as well make that day today. 
 

2. I think investing can seem really overwhelming. How do you pick what you want to invest in? And then where do you do it? How do you find a decent brokerage firm? There are a lot of questions that take some time to figure out how to answer. I think we also have more conservative approaches to money than a lot of men do. 
 

 Lauren from LBee and the Money Tree

My best advice to female investors is to take your time. If you don’t know what you’re doing, put your money into a target date fund that adjusts risks based on your retirement date. 
 

I think women don’t invest in their finances out of fear of failing at them. Ironically, as long as you are cognizant of your money, there is no way you can fail.
 

Stefanie from The Broke and Beautiful Life

I’d recommend women invest the same way as I’d recommend to anyone else- early on with a well-diversified set it and forget it approach.  As a millennial, I find women are as proactive with their finances as their male counterparts.  Unfortunately, I don’t see much investing from the generation as a whole.  Probably because they’re wary of the market from reaching financial independence at the height of the 2008 recession.
 

Erin from Journey to Saving

1.  My advice is to educate yourself. If investing seems intimidating, take confusion out of the equation by learning. There are tons of free resources out there that you can use to get started! You don’t have to go all in, either – take baby steps and ease yourself into the market. 
 

2.  I think being nervous is a big reason women don’t invest. Putting your money at risk in the market is difficult, but it’s necessary to grow wealth. I also think there’s an assumption that men should take care of investments, but the money is yours, too! You need to get involved. 
 

Crystal from Budgeting in the Fun Stuff

2.  I stick with the target date mutual funds and real estate because the research involved to intelligently invest in individual stocks seems overwhelming to me.  My husband relishes in finding reviews, data, and historical trends.  I see all of that as pure tedium.  Like doing taxes.  He does that too.  My grandma, my mother, and my uncle are all fantastic with stocks.  I just rather buy another rental property to go along with our first one some day…"
6,2015-02-23,Vycid,46,Anatomy of a Pair Trade: Subverting the Risk Premium,"Hi folks,

Today I am going to provide an example of how I believe it *is* possible to beat the market... on a risk-adjusted basis.

This is about the short CCA.TO / long CGO.TO trade [I've been promising to make a post about ""soon""](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2rzfls/crowdsourcing_active_investment_management/co25w3s?context=1) [for about a month](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2t47q6/why_this_sub_will_remain_a_shitty_sub/cnvuyla). Sorry 'bout that. The borrow through IB has been pretty spotty so I've been worried about a buy-in on CCA.TO. At this point I'm pretty confident that the lender's AQS system is just messed up (I saw 30,000 shares available to short one day, 0 the next).



There are two things I want to explain in this post:

1) The fundamental and statistical methods by which I evaluated the Cogeco pair trade (and why I concluded it was a really spectacular opportunity)

2) How I moved from that theory to establishing a market-neutral position

Before I get into the details, I want to be clear about a few things: 

* I'm not a quant or a finance professional
* Since I'm not an expert, I don't know if any of the content of this post is *actually* correct
* My motivations for sharing include A) validating that my logic *is* correct and B) the fact that I directly profit if anyone else opens this trade. So open this trade at your own risk.

Just as a quick introduction to the assets: COGECO, Inc. (CGO.TO) is the Canadian parent of the Canadian cable company COGECO Cable, Inc. (CCA.TO). COGECO owns 32% of the equity in COGECO Cable, but maintains full control because the CCA.TO shares have subordinated voting rights.

So the big question here is, why would you ever go long one asset and short another if those assets should be equivalent? As our esteemed friend observes, [isn't that like going long GOOG and short GOOGL](http://i.imgur.com/m90MXyi.png)? If the assets are really equivalent, doesn't the EMH imply that there should be no expectation return from doing so?

The answer is that there's no expectation return *given an arbitrary starting time, and an arbitrary exit time*. Because the EMH is made up and there's actually a lot of meaningless noise in security prices, it is possible to identify trades with an expectation return quite a lot larger than zero.

In fact, [there's been a lot](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/30005/does-it-make-sense-to-trade-my-googl-shares-for-goog-and-pocket-the-difference) [of talk about](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2223103-goog-vs-googl-a-classic-pairs-trade) [the GOOG/GOOGL pair trade](http://dealbreaker.com/2013/06/lets-hack-googles-share-split/). However, the spread between the two has never grown to the point that the risk-adjusted expectation return of the pair trade would outstrip the index so greatly as to be worth the hassle. This isn't a surprise, because Google's share volume is immense, the borrow is super easy, and there are tons of banks eyeballing it all the time.

The modest benefit the marginal buyer would get from purchasing the cheaper of GOOG or GOOGL has been sufficient to keep the two trading in a relatively tight band.

This happens not to be the case for COGECO.

---

Understanding the corporate structure is the first step in a trade like this, because voting rights may have some value. [Fortunately, the Canadian version of the FCC has done the heavy lifting already.](http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ownership/eng/cht043.pdf)

The conclusion is clear: Ms. Marie-Jeanne Audet controls the whole shebang, through her family office. Voting rights are pretty much irrelevant, since power isn't likely to transfer away from the Audets any time soon. So although there might hypothetically be more voting power (and therefore value) associated with a CGO share than a CCA share, it's probably negligible.

Next is validating CGO's 32% equity interest in CCA, and determining if there is a net positive or negative value associated with their other businesses (on the flowchart you will notice CGO's 100% controlling interest in local radio).

Here's [CGO's annual report](http://www.cogeco.ca/export/sites/cogeco/corporate/files/financial_annual_report_en/2014/ra2014e_cgo.pdf), and [CCA's annual report](http://www.cogeco.ca/export/sites/cogeco/corporate/files/financial_annual_report_en/2014/ra2014e_cca.pdf).

[Here's the relevant excerpt from the CGO report.](http://i.imgur.com/FoxAz05.png) It's clear that there is a 32% equity interest, and the 82.5% voting rights lines up with the CRTC flowchart.

But what are Cogeco Diffusion Acquisitions Inc. and Metromedia CMR Plus Inc? Does CGO itself have any operations? What is CGO's independent debt?

Consolidated accounting can make it a pain in the ass to figure the operations stuff out, [but fortunately CGO enumerates their debt](http://i.imgur.com/hl2MKfs.png). The parent company has $96.547 million CAD in excess debt.

In order to get a ballpark value for the independent CGO operations, I subtracted to get the yearly revenue from the non-CCA segment.

In 2014 the revenue attributable to CGO's non-CCA operations was $148.447 M CAD; in 2013 the differential was $141.791 M CAD. The Adj EBITDA was $14.905 and $17.919.

The EBITDA isn't headed in the right direction but the revenue is, and I'm fairly confident that those numbers fully justify the excess $100M or so of debt.

Alternatively, using the Shareholder's Equity values instead ($513.965 M CAD for CGO, $1508.256 M CAD for CCA), the ratio is 34%.

All in all it seems a very reasonable assumption that the fair market cap of CGO is *at least* 32% of CCA's market cap.

At Friday's close, the ratio stood below 28.6%, implying over 10% upside if the fair value is 32%. *Intredasting.*

___

So now it's on to the good part. Armed with a physical explanation for *why* the market cap of CGO ought to average around 32% of the market cap of CCA, the next question is, *does it*?

[Wolfram Alpha says ""yes"".](http://i.imgur.com/MY9CeMd.png)

But that isn't good enough... it's statistics time.

[A histogram of the daily adjusted close data from 1/3/2011 to 12/31/2014 looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/13EmKOw.png) Shapiro-Wilk says it's not normally distributed, but Shapiro-Wilk breaks down for large n anyhow.

So this is a classic case of statistical ""good enough"".

(There hasn't been a lot of dilution in the past few years that would make it inappropriate to use price as a proxy for market cap).

Major take-away: the 95% CI for the population mean CGO/CCA ratio is (0.945, 0.950). μ = 0.947.

CCA closed at $76.49 CAD on Friday. CGO closed at $63.76 CAD, for a ratio of about 0.834. Again we see more than 10% upside.

CCA has 48.79M shares outstanding, and CGO has 16.73M shares outstanding, so the market-cap ratio implied by μ is 0.947 * 16.73/48.79 = 32.5%, which also agrees well with the 32% assumption.

The physically-implied value of μ (which I use instead, since it is a less aggressive assumption, and since the O-U estimate is better anyhow) is μ * 16.73/48.79 = 32%, or

**μ = 0.93322**

So clearly this is a profitable trade, and the risk is very small, since by going long CGO and short CCA you are completely market-netural. The important question becomes ""what is the expectation time for mean-reversion?""

___

An [Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process) is defined as follows (italics indicate subscript):

dx*t* = λ(μ - x*t*) dt + σ dW*t*

Where λ is the speed parameter, μ is the mean, and σ is the volatility.

In other words, it's the continuous-time version of the AR(1) process. Simply, it is a time series which is expected to oscillate symmetrically about a mean.

The useful characteristic of the O-U process is the λ parameter. A fairly trivial proof will demonstrate that the half-life of the process (i.e., the expectation time for the CGO/CCA ratio to revert halfway to the mean) is equal to ln(2)/λ. So the goal now is to estimate λ.

A naive derivation of the discretized equation would look like this:

x*t* - x*t-1* = λ(μ - x*t-1*) Δt + σ dW*t*

x*t* = x*t-1* + λ(μ - x*t-1*) Δt + σ dW*t*

Since this fits the form y = a + bx + ε, it could then be regressed with ordinary least squares to obtain an estimate of λ, since λ = b / Δt.

However, [Gillespie points out](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.54.2084) that this naive derivation is not correct for sufficiently small Δt. The corrected equation is

x*t* = (1 - e^(-λΔt))μ + e^(-λΔt) * x*t-1* +  σ √((1 - e^(-2λΔt)) / (2λ)) dW*t*

Fortunately, this still fits the y = a + bx + ε form, with b = e^(-λΔt) and therefore λ = - ln(b) / Δt. However, in this case, y = x*t* and x = x*t-1*.

[Performing the fit, b = 0.9548904, with a standard error of 0.0096.](http://i.imgur.com/tK7f5cU.png)

And so the estimate of λ =  b / Δt = - ln(0.9548904) / day = 0.04616 / day.

Then, the half life is ln(2) / λ = ln(2) / 0.04616 = **15.02 days.**

However, λ is a notoriously difficult parameter to estimate. As a sanity check, I propagated the 95% CI for b through to λ (statistics folks: any input on this?)

So the bounds are b ± standard error * 1.96 (Z-score at 95% confidence): 

0.9548904 ± 0.018816 = (0.9172584, 0.9737064)

So the 95% ""half-life interval"" would be (ln(2)/(-ln(0.9172584), ln(2)/(-ln(0.9737064)) or

**(8.03 days, 26.01 days)**

I prefer to use the high bound of 26 days to evaluate the opportunity.

___

So this brings us to the execution phase. By the most conservative estimates, it is expected that the ratio will collapse 0.0495 - half the distance from 0.834 to 0.933 - in no more than 26 days. In other words, if you were able to trade the CGO/CCA ratio directly, the expectation return would be 5.94% in 26 days, or an annualized return of **about 83%**. Moreover, there's essentially no risk involved, because these two companies are highly correlated - a large fraction of the change in the ratio is the mean-reversion ""signal"", and the Sharpe ratio would be astronomical.

Plus, downside risk is miniscule, since this is already a major excursion (~2.5 sigma).

Unfortunately, as I mentioned at the beginning of the post, getting a borrow is challenging. I (and anyone else who is a US resident) cannot trade Canadian options, [because the SEC is run by a bunch of dipshits](https://web.archive.org/web/20071029061139/http://www.futuresindustry.org/fi-magazine-home.asp?a=960). Anyone who *does* live in Canada can establish a synthetic short with CCA options and set up a pretty big position that way.

(I just had to wait until shares showed up and then grabbed them.)

In order to avoid exposure to CAD, I tried to set my net Canadian equity exposure to zero. In other words, the size of my long CGO position is equal to the size of my short CCA position.

So at Friday's close ($76.49 and $63.76), for every round lot of CCA I was short, I'd get short 100 * 76.49/63.76 = 120 shares of CGO.

If CCA decreasing was responsible for 1/2 mean reversion, the profit would be:

63.76 / (76.49 - x) = 63.76 / 76.49 + 0.0495 

x / (2 * 76.49) = 4.28759 / (2 * 76.49) = **2.80%**

If CGO increasing was responsible, the profit would be:

(63.76 + y) / 76.49 = 63.76 / 76.49 + 0.0495 

y / (2 * 63.76) = 4.28759 / (2 * 63.76) = **2.97%**

Most likely, it will somewhere in between due to the action of both.

Because the risk here is so low, it probably makes sense to use some margin (I did, about 1:1.6, so my expectation return is roughly 1.6x higher than calculated above). 

Assuming the 1.6x leverage, expectation return should be ~4.5% to ~5% in a month.

It's worth mentioning that a major quirk of this whole deal is that profit/loss will be denominated in CAD.

Thanks for reading and happy trading."
7,2015-02-23,[deleted],1,Anatomy of a Pair Trade: Subverting the Risk Premium,"Hi folks,

This is about the short CCA.TO / long CGO.TO trade [I've been promising to make a post about ""soon""](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2rzfls/crowdsourcing_active_investment_management/co25w3s?context=1) [for about a month](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2t47q6/why_this_sub_will_remain_a_shitty_sub/cnvuyla). Sorry 'bout that. The borrow through IB has been pretty spotty so I've been worried about a buy-in on CCA.TO. At this point I'm pretty confident that the lender's AQS system is just messed up (I saw 30,000 shares available to short one day, 0 the next).



There are two things I want to explain in this post:

1) The fundamental and statistical methods by which I evaluated the Cogeco pair trade (and why I concluded it was a really spectacular opportunity)

2) How I moved from that theory to establishing a market-neutral position

Before I get into the details, I want to be clear about a few things: 

* I'm not a quant or a finance professional
* Since I'm not an expert, I don't know if any of the content of this post is *actually* correct
* My motivations for sharing include A) validating that my logic *is* correct and B) the fact that I directly profit if anyone else opens this trade. So open this trade at your own risk.

Just as a quick introduction to the assets: COGECO, Inc. (CGO.TO) is the Canadian parent of the Canadian cable company COGECO Cable, Inc. (CCA.TO). COGECO owns 32% of the equity in COGECO Cable, but maintains full control because the CCA.TO shares have subordinated voting rights.

So the big question here is, why would you ever go long one asset and short another if those assets should be equivalent? As our esteemed friend observes, [isn't that like going long GOOG and short GOOGL](http://i.imgur.com/m90MXyi.png)? If the assets are really equivalent, doesn't the EMH imply that there should be no expectation return from doing so?

The answer is that there's no expectation return *given an arbitrary starting time, and an arbitrary exit time*. Because the EMH is made up and there's actually a lot of meaningless noise in security prices, it is possible to identify trades with an expectation return quite a lot larger than zero.

In fact, [there's been a lot](http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/30005/does-it-make-sense-to-trade-my-googl-shares-for-goog-and-pocket-the-difference) [of talk about](http://seekingalpha.com/article/2223103-goog-vs-googl-a-classic-pairs-trade) [the GOOG/GOOGL pair trade](http://dealbreaker.com/2013/06/lets-hack-googles-share-split/). However, the spread between the two has never grown to the point that the risk-adjusted expectation return of the pair trade would outstrip the index so greatly as to be worth the hassle. This isn't a surprise, because Google's share volume is immense, the borrow is super easy, and there are tons of banks eyeballing it all the time.

The modest benefit the marginal buyer would get from purchasing the cheaper of GOOG or GOOGL has been sufficient to keep the two trading in a relatively tight band.

This happens not to be the case for COGECO.

---

Understanding the corporate structure is the first step in a trade like this, because voting rights may have some value. [Fortunately, the Canadian version of the FCC has done the heavy lifting already.](http://www.crtc.gc.ca/ownership/eng/cht043.pdf)

The conclusion is clear: Ms. Marie-Jeanne Audet controls the whole shebang, through her family office. Voting rights are pretty much irrelevant, since power isn't likely to transfer away from the Audets any time soon. So although there might hypothetically be more voting power (and therefore value) associated with a CGO share than a CCA share, it's probably negligible.

Next is validating CGO's 32% equity interest in CCA, and determining if there is a net positive or negative value associated with their other businesses (on the flowchart you will notice CGO's 100% controlling interest in local radio).

Here's [CGO's annual report](http://www.cogeco.ca/export/sites/cogeco/corporate/files/financial_annual_report_en/2014/ra2014e_cgo.pdf), and [CCA's annual report](http://www.cogeco.ca/export/sites/cogeco/corporate/files/financial_annual_report_en/2014/ra2014e_cca.pdf).

[Here's the relevant excerpt from the CGO report.](http://i.imgur.com/FoxAz05.png) It's clear that there is a 32% equity interest, and the 82.5% voting rights lines up with the CRTC flowchart.

But what are Cogeco Diffusion Acquisitions Inc. and Metromedia CMR Plus Inc? Does CGO itself have any operations? What is CGO's independent debt?

Consolidated accounting can make it a pain in the ass to figure the operations stuff out, [but fortunately CGO enumerates their debt](http://i.imgur.com/hl2MKfs.png). The parent company has $96.547 million CAD in excess debt.

In order to get a ballpark value for the independent CGO operations, I subtracted to get the yearly revenue from the non-CCA segment.

CCA closed at $76.49 CAD on Friday. CGO closed at $63.76 CAD, for a ratio of about 0.834. Again we see more than 10% upside.

CCA has 48.79M shares outstanding, and CGO has 16.73M shares outstanding, so the market-cap ratio implied by μ is 0.947 * 16.73/48.79 = 32.5%, which also agrees well with the 32% assumption.

The physically-implied value of μ (which I use instead, since it is a less aggressive assumption, and since the O-U estimate is better anyhow) is μ * 16.73/48.79 = 32%, or

**μ = 0.93322**

So clearly this is a profitable trade, and the risk is very small, since by going long CGO and short CCA you are completely market-netural. The important question becomes ""what is the expectation time for mean-reversion?""

___

An [Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process) is defined as follows (italics indicate subscript):

dx*t* = λ(μ - x*t*) dt + σ dW*t*

Where λ is the speed parameter, μ is the mean, and σ is the volatility.

In other words, it's the continuous-time version of the AR(1) process. Simply, it is a time series which is expected to oscillate symmetrically about a mean.

The useful characteristic of the O-U process is the λ parameter. A fairly trivial proof will demonstrate that the half-life of the process (i.e., the expectation time for the CGO/CCA ratio to revert halfway to the mean) is equal to ln(2)/λ. So the goal now is to estimate λ.

A naive derivation of the discretized equation would look like this:

x*t* - x*t-1* = λ(μ - x*t-1*) Δt + σ dW*t*

x*t* = x*t-1* + λ(μ - x*t-1*) Δt + σ dW*t*

Since this fits the form y = a + bx + ε, it could then be regressed with ordinary least squares to obtain an estimate of λ, since λ = b / Δt.

However, [Gillespie points out](http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.54.2084) that this naive derivation is not correct for sufficiently small Δt. The corrected equation is

x*t* = (1 - e^(-λΔt))μ + e^(-λΔt) * x*t-1* +  σ √((1 - e^(-2λΔt)) / (2λ)) dW*t*

Fortunately, this still fits the y = a + bx + ε form, with b = e^(-λΔt) and therefore λ = - ln(b) / Δt. However, in this case, y = x*t* and x = x*t-1*.

[Performing the fit, b = 0.9548904, with a standard error of 0.0096.](http://i.imgur.com/tK7f5cU.png)

And so the estimate of λ =  b / Δt = - ln(0.9548904) / day = 0.04616 / day.

Then, the half life is ln(2) / λ = ln(2) / 0.04616 = **15.02 days.**

However, λ is a notoriously difficult parameter to estimate. As a sanity check, I propagated the 95% CI for b through to λ (statistics folks: any input on this?)

So the bounds are b ± standard error * 1.96 (Z-score at 95% confidence): 

0.9548904 ± 0.018816 = (0.9172584, 0.9737064)

So the 95% ""half-life interval"" would be (ln(2)/(-ln(0.9172584), ln(2)/(-ln(0.9737064)) or

**(8.03 days, 26.01 days)**

I prefer to use the high bound of 26 days to evaluate the opportunity.

___

So this brings us to the execution phase. By the most conservative estimates, it is expected that the ratio will collapse 0.0495 - half the distance from 0.834 to 0.933 - in no more than 26 days. In other words, if you were able to trade the CGO/CCA ratio directly, the expectation return would be 5.94% in 26 days, or an annualized return of **about 83%**. Moreover, there's essentially no risk involved, because these two companies are highly correlated - a large fraction of the change in the ratio is the mean-reversion ""signal"", and the Sharpe ratio would be astronomical.

Plus, downside risk is miniscule, since this is already a major excursion (~2.5 sigma).

Unfortunately, as I mentioned at the beginning of the post, getting a borrow is challenging. I (and anyone else who is a US resident) cannot trade Canadian options, [because the SEC is run by a bunch of dipshits](https://web.archive.org/web/20071029061139/http://www.futuresindustry.org/fi-magazine-home.asp?a=960). Anyone who *does* live in Canada can establish a synthetic short with CCA options and set up a pretty big position that way.

(I just had to wait until shares showed up and then grabbed them.)

In order to avoid exposure to CAD, I tried to set my net Canadian equity exposure to zero. In other words, the size of my long CGO position is equal to the size of my short CCA position.

So at Friday's close ($76.49 and $63.76), for every round lot of CCA I was short, I'd get short 100 * 76.49/63.76 = 120 shares of CGO.

The only weird quirk of this is that profit/loss will be denominated in CAD.

I spent most of 2014 thinking about what it is that really causes people to trade in a companies shares. The answer was a while in coming. In technical trading there's a ton of indicators you can use. MACD, bollinger bands etc... But, I felt this wasn't quite right. It seemed to me that if I were the only person in the world with technical charts, they might not really help. Of course as with all 'great' ideas I had no data. So I assumed this to be true.

The conclusion I came to was that the root cause of movement was news. So I built a tool to scrape company news, do analysis of said news, and then rate and group the result by it's reliability over time. All of this was spat out 5 minutes before market open.

It worked. A couple of percent a day on the FTSE AIM All Share looks nice. In a completely automated fashion. It advised who to buy/or sell. And assumed that if the target was hit the position was closed at that point even if the target was exceeded. If the forecast target wasn't hit, the position was closed at the closing price. A daily end of day report showed that most of the forecasts outperformed the market. Me, I don't have money to trade, and neither am I interested in the big gamble.

12,2015-02-03,Vycid,143,"A historical note about ""calling a bottom"" for oil","Most of us remember the 2008 oil crash. Considering the attention being paid to the 12-14% bounce off the lows for WTI in the past couple days, I felt that some historical perspective might be instructive (obviously 2008 is not the only, or even the best, historical parallel - but the data is the most accessible).

All charts are in log scale. Y-axis is the front month WTI futures contract.

[Here is our situation now.](http://i.imgur.com/BYIkFyy.png) 12-14% off the lows. Some on this sub have taken this to be the bottom (and therefore a buy signal).

[2008: 35% off the lows. Was it the bottom?](http://i.imgur.com/h5FRVJh.png)

[Nope.](http://i.imgur.com/s7KjAGd.png)

[Here is how long the recovery actually took.](http://i.imgur.com/CyLBqwU.png)
I think it's important to observe that at no point would you have ""missed the boat"" by waiting a couple of weeks for the trend to establish itself. A 7% up day may feel like a big deal, but these are big moves over a period of many months.

Also, I am relatively confident that, for compelling macro reasons, the recovery will be slower this time around. I believe that the 2008 oil crash was due mainly to general economic chaos (as they say, correlations go to 1 in a crisis), but the industrial value of oil quickly reasserted itself - this time it is a matter of global supply and demand. The imbalance will resolve itself eventually (actually, in a sense, the price slide is restoring equilibrium) but the supply side of the equation will probably take more than a few months to properly adjust.

Finally, history tells us this: if you are an investor buying *durable* oil sector companies during the cyclical lows, over the next few years you will likely be rewarded for the extra risk you are assuming.

If you are instead a commodity speculator greedy enough to try to hit the exact bottom in oil, the market will straighten you out.

14,2015-03-14,[deleted],1,U.S. Energy producers ready for new wave of oil (from WSJ) - thoughts on oil? long &amp; short term?,"The ocean of oil from U.S. shale drove crude prices back toward six-year lows Friday, and American energy companies say they are poised to unleash a further flood that would keep prices from returning to lofty levels for a long time.


The International Energy Agency reinforced the prospect of a prolonged slump in energy prices Friday, saying U.S. oil output was surprisingly strong in February and rapidly filling all available storage tanks. The Paris-based energy watchdog said this could lead to another sharp drop in crude prices, which fell by about 50% late last year.


The report sent oil prices tumbling around the world, with the global benchmark Brent crude falling $2.41 to $54.67 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate lost $2.21 to settle at $44.84, less than 40 cents above a six-year low it reached in late January. Last summer, both traded well above $100.
It was only last month that the IEA said a price recovery seemed inevitable because the U.S. production boom was likely to cool. Instead, “U.S. supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down,” the agency said Friday. “Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations.”


Independent shale-oil producers have slashed their planned 2015 spending on drilling by $50 billion, compared with last year’s, but have promised to increase production by focusing on their best oil fields. Total U.S. crude oil production hit a high of 9.4 million barrels a day in the week ended March 6, according to federal data.
Now many are adopting a new strategy that will allow them to pump even more crude as soon as oil prices begin to rise. They are drilling wells but holding off on hydraulic fracturing, or forcing in water and chemicals to free oil from shale formations. The delay in the start of fracking lets companies store oil in the ground in a way that enables them to tap it unusually quickly if they wish—and flood the market again.


This strategy could put a cap on how high oil prices can rise once they are recovering, said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc.


“We’re in slightly unexplored territory,” Mr. Morse said. “It’s an experiment—a big, big experiment.”
EOG Resources Inc., an oil producer based in Texas, is drilling about 285 wells that it won’t start finishing off until crude oil’s price rebounds to between $60 and $65 a barrel.


“When oil prices recover, EOG will be prepared to resume strong double-digit oil growth,” Chief Executive Bill Thomas said recently.


Some other big names in U.S. energy also are delaying well completions, among them Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Apache Corp., Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Continental Resources Inc. These four plus EOG pumped 312 million barrels of oil in the U.S. in 2014, or almost 10% of American crude production.


The number of wells in Texas and North Dakota that have been drilled but aren’t yet pumping is at least 3,000, RBC Capital Markets estimates. That oil still in the ground “provides a war chest that could temper fundamental price spikes in the coming year,” RBC analyst Scott Hanold wrote in a Friday note.


This essentially is more U.S. crude in storage, akin to that in the tanks now brimming. The U.S. has 449 million barrels of oil sloshing around in tanks, the highest level on record and almost 70% of capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.


Even so, Jim Krane, an energy fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, questioned whether U.S. producers would be able to adjust oil production as quickly as, for instance, Saudi Arabia has proved able to do in the past. “We’ll probably have more price volatility because even as nimble as shale is, it’s not as nimble as OPEC,” he said. The shale producers “can’t just go out and turn a valve.”


It isn’t as though the price plunge hasn’t affected production.


The number of oil rigs drilling in the U.S. declined by 56 this week to 866, a 46% drop since early October when oil was traded for about $90 a barrel, according to oilfield-service company Baker Hughes Inc. Some production cutbacks are starting to materialize.


North Dakota regulators said Thursday the state’s oil output declined 3% in January from the record level reached in December.

Market observers have been waiting for U.S. shale production to cool down since November, when Saudi Arabia said it would keep pumping oil at high levels to preserve its own customer base. Some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said at the time that the move would force American producers to cut pumping because their oil is relatively expensive to produce.


U.S. companies aren’t necessarily looking to fill OPEC’s shoes as the so-called swing producer that can adjust production to help set price levels.


For many, delaying oil production from drilled wells is a financial decision; finishing off a well and putting it into service accounts for 60% of the well’s total price.


By pushing off that expense, companies hope they can earn more from higher oil prices once they finally do pump and sell their crude. They also are expecting their costs will fall as oilfield-service providers vie for their business.


Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources Inc., a producer in North Dakota, has urged peers to hold off on completing as many wells as possible.


Continental is waiting to hook up 127 already-drilled wells, postponing up to $1 million in spending apiece.
“Save that money,” Mr. Hamm said recently.


“Avoid selling that production in this poor market and wait for service costs to fall before completing those wells. Most people are doing that,” he said.

The best performing technology fund since the peak of the dot-com boom did it all without owning Apple, whose soaring stock price has pushed the Nasdaq near a new record high.

The $941 million Fidelity Select IT Services fund has returned an average of 10.9 percent a year since March 10, 2000. That's more than double any other technology fund tracked by Lipper, and trounces the 0.1 percent a year generated over the same period by the PowerShares QQQ ETF.

This is a fund that doesn't have Google, doesn't have Microsoft. This is a wholly different subset of technology than most investors are familiar with.

The fund invests at least 80 percent of its assets in firms that provide day-to-day services such as payment processing and web hosting. The key is looking for companies with recurring revenue and operate in the background.

For example, couple key positions include Vantiv, a payment processing company, and data analytics company Cognizant Technology Solutions.

It's  is a very concentrated fund and while it has companies like IBM but also small and mid-cap companies that will fly below the radar for most investors.

One of the big reasons for its outperformance is its top holdings, which are Visa and Mastercard, both of which are up more than 220 percent over the last five years. Together, the companies make up about 26 percent of the fund's assets. Neither is the top holding in any other technology fund."
16,2015-03-06,[deleted],0,What Millennials Want (in terms of investing). Long read.,"Millennials are still in the very early stages of market participation: those under 35 own just 4% of mutual fund assets, but the 80-90 million millennials will soar in importance to everyone in the wealth/asset management business before too long. Through inheritance alone, millennials stand to receive $30 trillion in the next few decades. Where they start will often be where they grow. Some, like Wealthfront and forward thinking financial advisors, are tapping into this young potential already. So, if you are in the financial services business, how can you do the same?

I’ve learned a lot about young people and what they want since publishing Millennial Money late last year, and I believe these findings are relevant for financial advisors, millennial investors, and all those trying to win their business. The book has given me great access. Here’s what I’ve learned.

Young People Don’t Trust You

Millennials have a big issue with trust. In a very recent survey of wealthier millennials, just 19% agreed that advisors in general have their clients’ best interests at heart. 40% actively disagreed with this notion. Millennials are selfish (in a good way): with everything they buy, they want to know they are getting the most value possible for the price. In this same survey, 72% of them responded that they are “self-directed” investors and 41% said they’d received no financial advice.

Most of the millennials in this survey had more than $3M to invest and more than a quarter of them had more than $10M. They equated advisors with salesmen.

The solution is to educate them, rather than sell them. I like the idea that “when you sell, you break rapport, but when you educate, you build it.” [i]

This education can come in many forms. Regular white papers, commentary, blog posts, even twitter messages that teach investors why your style of investing/way of doing business makes sense and will work. If you are a financial advisor, do an event with your clients AND their children. The single most effective event I’ve done was a night at a club in LA, hosted by one of the best advisor teams we work with. I made a short presentation to 50 or so young people, many of whom were the children of the advisor’s top clients. These people were extremely hungry to learn, but just hadn’t had the chance or the time. I’ve heard from many of them since that night and two things stand out. One, they want to hear more about investing strategies, and two they want to build a relationship with an advisor who can help them learn.

Education is key. It builds trust and can secure multi-generational relationships.

Young People Like Three Key Attributes In Investing Strategies

A specific style of investing strategy resonates with millennials. Three criteria stand out: these strategies are rules-based, transparent, and mindful of fees and costs. Millennials have thus far liked index funds because they meet these criteria so well. I am naturally a bit biased given that O’Shaughnessy Asset Management manages quantitative/systematic strategies. We like to think that we are marrying the best aspects of active and passive investing: the disciplined, consistent, rules based approach of an index with a much more effective strategy based on principles like valuation, quality, momentum, and total yield.

Millennials like index funds, but they also like systematic strategies. I won’t explore Smart Beta here, because it means so many things, but the idea of a rules-based, systematic strategy has resonated well with young investors. They can understand it because they understand the rules. They are transparent. They tend to charge reasonable fees. Only 20% of wealthy millennials though that fees in our business were reasonable. Reaching them with these kinds of strategies works. They like index funds, but are also open to active strategies.

Young Investors Will Demand Automation—So Embrace Technology Now

Have you tried signing up for Wealthfront or Acorns? I have. It’s insanely easy. I get physically uncomfortable and annoyed when I want something and I can’t get it easily—in under 10 minutes, from my iPhone, sitting on my couch. And I am probably on the patient end of my generation. We are spoiled rotten by technology, so financial services solutions need to be easy, accessible, and fast as possible. Obviously there will be limitations depending on your line of business, but the smoother and easier and more automated you can make the experience the better your chances with millennials now and in the future.

If you run a business and don’t have a programmer, hire one. If you have one, hire more. At O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, our large programming team has become the lifeblood of our firm. We are quantitative investors who test myriad different strategies on historical data. Back in 2007, when I had an idea that I wanted to test, it took me roughly 36 hours to set up the test, run the historical simulation, collect the results, and perform the analysis. That same sequence takes me about 10-15 minutes today. I can answer just about any question about market history in minutes because of the technology at my fingertips. Doing the same in your business by automating as much as possible can make a huge difference. Imagine if all the repetitive tasks associated with your business went away, and imagine the time that would free up to focus on the areas where you are really skilled. These kinds of tasks are a hassle, removing them is good for you.

I am no proponent of modern portfolio theory or the efficient market hypothesis, yet I still send tons of people to Wealthfront. I do so because it is so easy that I know people will actually get started, and because friends who have $10,000 to invest will appreciate the very solid service. It’s not perfect, but it’s infinitely better than doing nothing. In ten years, those same people might have $1,000,000 with the same company.

Don’t Be Evil, Be Human

I am repentant for my former skepticism of blogs and twitter. For a long time I thought they were unprofessional. I couldn’t have been more wrong. These venues sync up with the millennial audience so well. They are transparent, they build trust, they help you educate your audience, and to connect with them in a way that is human, not just professional.

I think that is all young people (or maybe just people) really want: helpful services, charging fair prices, offered by people who are fundamentally good and honest.

It is amazing how different the world of finance is. Here is a passage from Tragedy and Hope (an amazing history of the early 20th century), about banking and the bankers that more or less ran the world:

“they remained as private unincorporated firms, usually partnerships, until relatively recently, offering no shares, no reports, and usually no advertising to the public…This period, 1884-1933, was the period of financial capitalism in which investment bankers moving into commercial banking and insurance on one side and into railroading and heavy industry on the other were able to mobilize enormous wealth and wield enormous economic, political, and social power. Popularly known as “Society,” or the “400,” they lived a life of dazzling splendor. Sailing the ocean in great private yachts or traveling on land by private trains, they moved in a ceremonious round between their spectacular estates and town houses in Palm Beach, Long Island, the Berkshires, Newport, and Bar Harbor; assembling from their fortress-like New York residences to attend the Metropolitan Opera under the critical eye of Mrs. Astor; or gathering for business meetings of the highest strategic level in the awesome presence of J. P. Morgan himself.”

Some might argue that this still happens to some extent today. But remember that when millennials were asked to identify their ten most hated brands, the four big banks all made the list.

Google’s motto “don’t be evil” is a great starting point for the financial services industry today.

Getting Them to Act Is the Hardest Part

Usually we need to be discontent or frustrated to take action. The further away a problem is in time, the less motivated we are to do something about it. The problem should be clear: millennials have decades before retirement.

The philosopher Eric Hoffer wrote an amazing book on mass movements called The True Believer, which I recommend to everyone. In the book he says, it is not the distant kind of hope, but the “around-the-corner brand of hope that prompts people to act.” It is so hard to envision a period 40-50 years in the future, and even harder to get people to act for a reward so distant. I’ve learned this firsthand the hard way. I spent too much time selling young people on 40-year returns, trying to appeal to their reason. They all nod their heads, agree, and then do nothing.

Instead I should have been appealing to emotions and immediate needs. If you are an advisor, don’t just sell the potential for long term wealth (although that is good), but also the benefits of working with you that they will feel immediately that may be frustrating them now.

Think of Maslow’s pyramid, his hierarchy of human needs. People will act most readily to satisfy their most basic needs. In the case of investing, shelter is key. Millennials need the equivalent of a financial shelter, but with a negative 2% savings rate, they aren’t building financial shelters. I think introducing first the idea of building a financial shelter—to cover short term needs when they arise—is a powerful way to get millennials interested and started saving.

Investing comes next. Again, a 40 year compound growth number sounds great, but it doesn’t precipitate action. So frame it differently. We are twice as sensitive to losses and negative things as gains or positive things. Frame the need to invest negatively. Don’t say invest with me and you’ll be rich in 40 years. Say save and invest more now and you won’t risk being without support now and in the future. You might think this is a slimy sales tactic, but it’s not. Anything that gets young people started sooner is a good thing.

Consider this. Two groups were asked to explore a virtual world using virtual reality goggles. In the virtual world, the members of each group eventually came across a mirror which showed either their current face or a version of their face which had been digitally enhanced to make them look like what they will at age 70. When asked later in the experiment, the group which saw the aged photos said they’d plan to save at twice the rate as those which saw the normal photos. The effect of the aged photo made them emotional but also made old age seem closer, and more immediate. These are useful lessons in motivation.

Playing the Millennial Long Game

Young investors haven’t built up a huge collective fortune—so right now they are not the biggest or most important clients. By time will take care of that. Should robo-advisors—who are counting on riding this millennial wave—be valued at the multiples they are? As a group, probably not. But one or more of them will be huge because they are finely tuned in to the preferences of their current and prospective clients.

I believe that the profile of a firm or strategy that will win millennials’ business and help them succeed is as follows. It will use technology to automate as much as possible and make working with the company easy and efficient, because millennials will demand it. It will be transparent and good. It will focus on rules based asset allocation and selection strategies with low fees. Finally, it will deal with them in a way that educates and builds trust and provides not just solid long term results, but also immediate help in areas that millennials are frustrated.

As Gretzky always said, skate to where the puck is going.

17,2015-03-05,staticchange,99,My thesis on the oil supply,"I recently typed up some research (really just thumbing through EIA records) on historical US crude oil supply and demand in the first half of 2014, how it compares to this year, and what we might be able to infer from this data.

I posted this as a response in another ""investment"" sub, but thought I would post it here as well for more exposure.

I'm not sure why oil moved higher today, as I thought the news on US crude inventory growth was very bearish. See here for the EIA report: http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/pdf/highlights.pdf

I've been looking for some reason why the price might move up. I've seen some news sources claim its due to weaker than expected inventory growth at Cushing, and an expected increase in the refineries input in the near future as strikes/bad weather end.

However, I went and looked at the records from EIA on the refinery capacities last year when oil reached its peak. Here is the information I found:

* January refinery capacity: 87.7% Inventories: 358.1 mb
* February refinery capacity: 87.3% Inventories: 363.8 mb
* March refinery capacity: 86.3% Inventories: 380.1 mb
* April refinery capacity: 90.3% Inventories: 397.6 mb
* May refinery capacity: 89.5% Inventories: 389.5 mb
* June refinery capacity: 88.7% Inventories: 384.9 mb
* July refinery capacity: 93.4% Inventories: 365.6 mb

I didn't include the months after July as that was when oil started to decline in price.

Last year the inventories didn't even stop growing until sometime in May, and they actually grew at their fastest pace in April. There was a net change of +5.7 million barrels from January 2014 to February 2014. There was a net change of -19.3 million barrels from June 2014 to July 2014. The total change in inventory growth between these two times was 25 million barrels.

Here is the data so far for this year:

* January refinery capacity: 88.6% Inventories: 413.1 mb
* February refinery capacity: 88.2% Inventories: 444.4 mb

So far the net change between January 2015 and February 2015 has been +31.3 million barrels. Even when summer is in full swing, the normal yearly decline in inventory grow won't be enough to offset the current growth unless something changes.

Furthermore, everyone makes a big deal about the refinery strikes, and they make a big deal about the effect weather has on the refineries. But the numbers don't agree with this, as refineries are at higher operating capacity this year than they were last year. Demand is actually up since last year. The problem isn't demand. The problem is massive supply.

I looked at the 2013 data as well, and it is very similar to the 2014 data. Inventories grew at roughly the same speeds and then peaked in April before heading lower. Note that the refinery capacities were even lower in 2013 than they were in 2014, with an average capacity for February of only 83.5%. Knowing this, I feel confident in saying our refineries are absolutely not operating under capacity for this time of year.

I think people are finding excuses to push the price higher currently, the fact that Cushing had lower inventory growth than expected doesn't seem very important to me, as the total inventory growth was still up a staggering 22% from last week. That oil was all stored somewhere. If last year is any guide, we may expect refineries to process even less oil in March, and for inventories to grow at accelerating rates for at least the next two months.

On the flip-side, the gap between Brent and WTI is closing and I don't know why, so that worries me. I don't intend for anyone to make investment decisions based off of my limited research here. If you want to look through the weekly EIA reports for yourself you can find the historical issues I referenced here: http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/archive/

If anyone else would like to shed some light on the current situation it would be welcome."

19,2015-04-29,ohrlee,66,Growth Investing - What company today will be 10x the size in the future?,"**Goal:** Let's identify the strongest opportunity for investment today, something that in the future we'll look back on and say THANK GOODNESS or WHY :( didn't I put my money into that (regrets: nflx, aapl, cmg, sbux, etc)
    
    
**Requirements:**    
-Publicly traded company    
-Common stock investment (not option, ETF, etc)    
-Market capitalization of at least $100MM    
-Timeframe 5 years    
-You would invest in this company, after all this company is going to be 10x in the future    
-Bullet point your reasons    
-Bonus points for safety: strong balance sheet (assets &gt; liabilities), little to no debt, profitable today    
-Bonus bonus point for identifying the biggest risk to company, but mitigate it.
    
    
**My Pick:**    
**OLED - Universal Display Corporation**    
-Leader in OLED (organic light emitting diodes) technologies with over 3,500 global patents    
-Big name display and lighting manufacturers have supply and license/royalty agreements with UDC including Samsung, LG, BOE, Innolux, Philips, Oledworks, etc.    
-Growing list of consumer applications that OLED technology is designed into including Samsung phones/tablets, Apple watch, LG OLED TVs, virtual reality displays, lighting, vehicle lighting, etc.    
-Still very much beginning of product cycle for OLED technology.    
-Investment in manufacturing capacity is continuing and is coming online in Korea, Japan, China, and US.    
-Increased production capacity will continue to bring down costs of OLED devices.    
-OLED displays have power, contrast, color range/accuracy, and slimness benefits over LCD technology.  (note still some pros and cons, but largely positive)    
-Strong and growing margins    
-Revenue and EPS growth, profitable today with J-curve potential    
-Strong balance sheet and no debt    

**Biggest Risk:** Technology obsolescence.  Mitigated by the fact that the product cycle and trends are point up and to the right, plus current investments into manufacturing facilities cost billions of dollars.  Big boys don't push that type of cash into weak technologies, and they definitely have a significant expectation for a return on their investment.   Second key risk: Patent cliffs, mitigated by recent 1/26/15 LG long term Material Supply and License/Royalty Agreement that goes through 2022.
Cheers all.  I hope to hear counter arguments to my idea, as well as your other great investment ideas!    
**_Note on Position_**: I am long OLED with 50% of my portfolio invested in this company.  I highly suggest you do your own research and due diligence before investing.

20,2015-04-28,[deleted],8,NFLX- A Burdened Bloat (SELL),"On April 16, 2015, news broke that Netflix (NFLX), streaming media giant, surpassed CBS (CBS) in market capitalization, a sign of rapid growth in a company that four-years prior had been considered dead due to a failed spin-off deal .  With reports that the revenue and net income of Netflix, essential for a growth stock such as this particular, increased to substantial levels, many purchased shares in the company, thereby pushing 

Lost in all of the mania that seems to befall institutional investors and their individual clients is that, while it is true that the company has grown in the past decade, the rapidity of the stock has grown at an even faster rate, propelling the stock to levels not seen since the days of AOL and Yahoo a generation prior.  If the price had grown at a modest pace, investing long-term into Netflix would have been a sound and rational move.  However, at the current price of $571.55, as of April 17, 2015, the value of Netflix is too high.  

To start, it is important to note that in the world of investing, nearly any stock is worth some sort of price.  The question most investors should ask in a two-part process is: what is the value of the company, and is the current price trading at a bargain of the value?  

Currently, as of April 18, 2015, the share price of Netflix was $571.55.  With an earnings of $4.32, the P/E ratio of Netflix was 132.30, an astonishing number in a comparatively high, but modest (compared to 1999), market. With a book value per share of 30.75, the P/B ratio of Netflix was 18.10.  From the get go, compared to the S&amp;P 500, which possesses a P/E ratio of 20.34, and a P/B ratio of 2.82, Netflix is an overvalued stock.  It is true that in the short-run, Netflix may seem like an undervalued stock due to the market’s psychological need for purchasing shares of technology stocks during times of economic boom.  However, as a long-term stock, the purchasing price currently imposed to potential investors is one that is too high.  

To start with, rather than establishing a monopoly over other technologies, thereby increasing the worth of the brand, Netflix is becoming more-and-more dependent on other technologies and brands, thereby putting the blossoming companies life in the hands of other, more advantageous, ones.  

Gradually, as time went on, more-and-more emphasis was placed on streaming over DVD-by-mail membership services. In the 2014 10-K of Netflix, the company reported a decrease in American DVD revenues, stemming from a 16 percent decrease in DVD paid memberships.  Interestingly enough – one that should raise a red flag for investors – is that despite a clear decrease in the revenues of DVD membership, the company added $71.49 million in amortization of DVD content library, compared to $71.33 million in 2013. While it is sensible that amortization of streaming content library increased in 2014 compared to 2013, this was due to an increase in subscribers for the streaming section of Netflix. 

Ironically, one of the boasting points behind Netflix and their rising stock, one involving additional cash, hurts the company due to the method to which they obtain said monetary funds. In the 2014 10-K, Netflix reported that they earned an additional $408.1 million compared to 2013 ($1.6085 billion in 2014 vs. $1.2004 billion in 2013).  At first, this sounds astonishing considering that Netflix in 2012 possessed $748.1 million in cash.  In other words, in a mere two full years of business, Netflix was able to double their cash holdings.  However, during these two years, Netflix issued heavy debt in the form of convertible bonds and high-yield fixed income notes.  By issuing 8.5 percent bonds, Netflix issued corporate bonds on par with amounts one can generally expect from casino companies.  While Netflix has additional cash, the same company also has additional debt, which must be paid off through either interest or conversion into common stock.  

With regards to short-term investments, Netflix is also hurting their long-term value of current assets. Netflix has $111.76 million in money-market funds and $3.6 million in CD’s, ones that could potentially yield a lower rate than the U.S. interest rate.  In other words, once Netflix pulls out their money from a money market fund, they will find that said money is worth less than when they put their money in the fund.  Netflix has $295.50 million in corporate bonds, and $168.75 million in Government bonds.  Although these bring higher-yield than money market funds and CD’s, many of the corporate bonds fail to have a steady risk-to-return ratio; and in the case of American Government bonds, while the risk is lower, so is the return.  

It is important for Netflix to use their short-term cash because in their 2014 10-K, Netflix announced that they had a negative cash flow of $126.70 million.  Compared to 2013, Netflix in 2014 lost $81.3 million in cash from operating activities due to attempting to purchasing content for their subscribers.  Further hampered by purchasing $69.72 million in property and equipment, Netflix in 2014 had a Non-GAAP FCF of -$126.70 million. In other words, Netflix has no spare money to pay off future debts from the bonds that the company has issued out in recent years.  This puts Netflix in a pickle. Since Netflix does not have any cash to expand, it must issue debt.   However, while in the short-term, Netflix has cash to expand internationally and domestically, it must pay off their debt with future cash flow.  This is problematic, since Netflix does not have any positive cash flow.  Thus, to survive, Netflix must incur further debt through bonds in order to expand and pay off past debt.  Netflix has plans to pay $9.8 billion in future streaming content through money that is non-existent.  

The situation involving negative cash flow brings up a delicate situation for Netflix.  The streaming-media giant is one that uses Amazon Web Services in order to receive essential services, such as data processing, storage capabilities, and cloud computing software and hardware.  In order for Netflix to switch over to their own home-grown service, the company would have to temporarily suspend operations since their entire operations involves computing systems.  This creates a snowball effect of losing customers, revenue, net income, share price, and market capitalization. Furthermore, by depending on a rival streaming service for the maintenance of their service, it would be equivalent to RCA (Radio) depending on Consolidated Edison (ED) towards the development of radio stations during the 1920’s, or Yahoo depending on AOL during the 1990’s.  Netflix attempts to quell the weariness of investors by assuring them that Amazon will not strike against the company, noting that, “while the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service.”  However, Netflix cannot be fully sure of this, especially since Amazon’s streaming service is supplemented by their Prime service.  If Amazon was to offer a subscription service that competed with Netflix, to further enhance their competitive nature, Amazon could remove Netflix’s service, thereby ruining the media-streaming giant. 

Coincidentally, by gaining a dependence on Amazon in terms of software and hardware, Netflix is also dependent on Amazon in the investment market. If Amazon was to decrease tremendously in value, the stock’s decline would influence Netflix to decline in value as well.  Likewise, by being dependent on Netflix as a source of revenue, the decline of Netflix would mean the decline of Amazon’s market capitalization.   These proposition, mind the reader, are a long-term one and not a short-term one.  Despite the rapid short-term fluctuations of Amazon’s stock, stemming from a loss in earnings, Netflix is steadily rising in price. 

Historically, the connection between Netflix and Amazon is not new.  In the previous generation, when the dot-com bubble reached massive proportions, one would see a similar connection with AOL and other internet companies. During this time, AOL looked for additional streams of revenue in the form of advertising.  Meanwhile, burgeoning internet companies were looking for advertising that would increase their viewings, thereby increasing their share price in the form of irrational exuberance. By brokering a deal between Pets.com and AOL, for example, a dependence was set.  The survival of Pets.com depended on AOL using ad space for the pet-oriented company.  Meanwhile, AOL was dependent on the canine-friendly brand as a source of revenue, which at the time was the main factor in investment by speculators on the market.  If AOL decided to take away the ad space of Pets.com, for example, and replace the ad with an ad for Priceline.com, Pets.com would have lost an important stream of profit, thus killing the company.  Likewise, if AOL abandoned their arrangement with Pets.com, the founder of “You Got Mail” would lose revenue, thereby losing a part of their bottom line. 

TL;DR:  The company is too bloated with debt and overvaluation that the company should not be bought.  Sell now and reap your rewards. 

Critics of the proposition argue that unlike Pets.com, Netflix is “too big to fail.”  However, in the previous example, one must note that AOL, a much larger company during their heyday, collapsed under the circumstance of being too dependent on other companies as a source of success. AOL depended on smaller internet companies with their gullibility as a source of revenue.  When AOL lost these companies due to the early stages of the dot-com bubble bursting, AOL lost revenue, creating a snowball effect that eventually led to the demise of the company in its’ original form. 

In short, Netflix is a fundamentally unsound company.  Like many technological companies that have come before Netflix, the media streaming organization is stuck in a rut.  Speculators purchase the stock due to perceived unlimited upside potential in the future.  In the short-term, the company is valued higher than CBS because of the rapid growth in the company.  However, because Netflix is starting to lose money despite gaining money, Netflix as a large brand will eventually shrink in size, both in price and value, when the next correction occurs.  This is important, since the goal of our research team is to make sure that we do not purchase at an overvalued price.

21,2015-04-22,[deleted],0,"As a beginner in investing, index funds have convinced me there is no point in picking stocks this since index funds are widely available now and rarely beat.","Basically there doesn't seem to be any point in picking up stocks, researching and risking it. Just invest with the index, don't beat the market. You will do just fine. 
The alternative is a lot of time spent researching, operating and generally stressing about.
It is a matter of simple cost of opportunity: you are better off generating assets in a different way or just spending your time to enjoy life rather than speculating about stocks to make a big buck.

Professionals who do it for a living don't even beat the index funds a lot of the times as data shows. To me it seems that there is no point in even bothering with investing beyond the simple basics(unless it is your job). It is actually disheartening since I like this and I wanted to spend a lot of time researching and trying to make some money in the process. 

What would your answer to this be?"
22,2015-04-09,yellowpage09,7,China's money and credit growth to soften,"
It has been difficult to forecast China's money growth since September 2014 when the banking regulator announced it would impose punitive measures on large volatility in banks deposits. Chinese banks then started to behave and scale back their quarter-end deposit-snatching competition. 

As a result, the money growth rates derived from the stock data have diverged from those adjusted and reported by the central bank. Compounding this is the unpredictable nature of the post-holiday effects, thus forecasting money growth in March becomes a big  challenge. 

Observing the adjustments done by the central bank for September and December data last year, the reported M2 growth is likely to have shown little change in March. However, the unadjusted data should have shown a notable drop. The growth of both bank lending and non-banking credit is expected to soften. 
Societe Generale forecasts CNY1,100bn net increases in bank loans, not an unusual number for March - and it implies a small decline in the yoy growth of the stock of bank loans to 14% from 14.1%. Meanwhile, credit growth in the shadow bankingsector is likely to remain affected by tighter regulations and rising risk aversion. The monthly volume might rebound, albeit less than suggested by a normal seasonal pattern.

The official FX reserves to decline further from $3,840bn at end-2014 to $3,800bn at end-Q1 2015. The sharp depreciation of the euro should have been a factor, and the central bank also sold down its FX reserves at the beginning of the year to support the yuan.

2. Facebook - have acquired big companies before, are the number one leader in social and want to remain there.

24,2015-05-21,the-autodidact,1,"Can someone please explain how VIX derivatives work in layman terms? i.e. SVXY, XIV, UVXY, &amp; TVIX","I am very interested in learning more about how these VIX based securities actually work. There is very little information readily available, let alone readable for the average investor.

The more detailed explanation you all can provide me the better. However, I want to stress that I would like an explanation that myself and others can actually understand and follow. 

(I understand there may be some concepts that must require more in-depth knowledge based on multiple levels of concepts that make up these complex derivatives. That being said, if this is inevitably the case, please link to material that said base concepts can be referenced to. But obviously if you can adequately explain these base concepts here, and in plain english, that is preferred.)

Please feel free to correct me if i'm far off, but i'll first explain how I think these derivatives function.

Lets start with the VIX. From what I understand, the VIX, otherwise known as the ""fear index"" is an overall indicator of perceived market volatility based on S&amp;P 500 options contracts for a 30 day period, meaning an indicator of how much the overall market may go up or down in the next 30 days.

So, for example, if the VIX is at 15, one could figure out how much the market is expected to move up or down by doing the following. 
-Because the actual VIX level is an annual representation, one must deannualize it, or rather boil it down to look at it on a monthly basis
-One would divide .15 (15%) by the square root of 12, to get the monthly outlook (I don't understand why its divided by the square root of 12, rather than just 12)
-This would equal .0288, or about 2.9% monthly outlook
-So, this would tell you that the market is perceived by investors to either go up or down by 2.9% over the next 30 days
That is my basic understanding of what a given VIX number actually means

(Most of my understanding of the VIX comes from blog posts from a guy named Reid Steadman on Indexologyblog.com, here is a link to a list of his posts http://www.indexologyblog.com/author/reid_steadman/)

Finally, Steadman argues that the VIX is mode (not mean) reverting and that a VIX level hovering around 13 (how ironic for a fear index) is most typical. (data Steadman used in the article was calculated using all 2,517 trading days in which the VIX had existed up until the article was published on May 23, 2014)

So, that is in a nutshell how I think I understand how the VIX works.

Now to the VIX derivatives. 

From what I understand, SVXY is an ETF that operates inversely to the VIX, meaning that if the VIX goes down SVXY goes up. My understanding is also that just so long as the market doesn't go down, SVXY will gradually rise in value. Meaning that in a stagnant market, SVXY is still a good bet. My thinking on SVXY has been that i'm basically betting over that longer term (lets say over the next 1-3 years) that there won't be another depression/recession or global catastrophe, resulting in an overall stable market and low levels of volatility over the long term. 

(I get that if something does go wrong [i.e. another recession/catastrophe] then a significant amount of SVXY value will be wiped out. However, my thinking is that if this were the case, then everyone would be screwed. Screwed, in that, in such a situation, almost all stocks would lose significant value. An example would be if I were to be holding something as simple as a share of Bank of America [lets just ignore for now BofA's issues of fines or other issues that could make it go down otherwise, for the sake of this conversation] or Starbucks, in that both of these lost tremendous valued during the 2008 financial crisis.)

(my understanding is that XIV basically does the same thing as SVXY, but is an ETN, and therefore inherently has slightly more risk due to the idea of 'Counterparty Risk'. Counterparty risk meaning that if XIV's Credit Suisse went bankrupt, its backed ETN's would be worthless. Whereas an ETF [i.e. SVXY] would retain some value even if its backer went under, albeit very little value)

My understanding of UVXY and TVIX is that they are 2X volatility ETF's that essentially move with the VIX. If the market does poorly, or if there is some sort of short term global catastrophe, these two will do well. But from what I have seen, although these two can, and indeed do, periodically have big gains, they are all short lived relative to the big picture (going off the basis of a 1-3 year time horizon)
-I really don't quite understand what i'm about to describe, but from what I think i've discerned from numerous articles i've read, it looks as if the actual structuring of these derivatives (UVXY and TVIX) makes it so that they are built to lose value over time (assuming a stable market). I kept thinking that numerous reverse splits over the last 3 years were an indicator of this idea being true. 

I also remember reading an article (which i've list below) about the creator of the VIX saying he thought that these derivatives were essentially built to fail, saying, “virtually guaranteed to lose money through time.” If this is in fact the case, would it not logically make sense to bet against these derivatives, either through shorts, puts, of buying an inverse volatility eft (i.e. SVXY)?

http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2014/06/27/vix-creator-shocked-appalled-at-volatility-etfs-backs-a-competitor/

Additionally, I was curious as to why anyone would want to buy something like UVXY or TVIX if they are so likely to lose value. From what I surmised, I believed that hedge funds and other large institutional investors buy these to keep in their back pockets basically as doomsday insurance. In that, holding these, in case of a global financial meltdown and/or global catastrophe, would essentially hedge their overall portfolio in this particular (even if unlikely) scenario. 

I also would guess that day traders try to utilize UVXY and TVIX in anticipation of high market volatility.

With all this in mind, i'm thinking my strategy will be to buy slightly out of the money 9 month SVXY call options. I feel like 9 months will provide enough time to weather through any sort of relative short term market shock/scare and provide a clear path towards profitability. (I realize that if something bad does happen in the market, this strategy will obviously not work, and will in fact fail miserably. But again, i'm betting that the sky will not fall in the relative long term.)


I know that was very long and I appreciate all who took the time to read this. To clarify, these are my understandings of how the VIX and its derivatives function from my reading of numerous financial articles over the past 3 years. However, said materials are limited and not written for the average investor (or for that matter fairly advanced investors, in that I think the VIX is a pretty obscure thing to most investors, not to mention its derivatives) more often than not providing little clarity on overall functionality. So without further adieu, please provide me constructive criticism and enlightenment.

Thanks!"
25,2015-05-21,digitalnomadcap,0,10 Things An Investor Must Do Before Investing,"Investing in private companies is not easy. These are risky, illiquid, long-term investments, so you need to do a lot of work upfront to increase your odds of success. I’ve spent my entire career either investing into private companies or helping investors and companies connect through an online investing platform. In my experience, here are 10 things investors must to before investing:

**1) Talk with the CEO**.  When we first launched our equity crowdfunding platform, I was amazed that some online platforms were selling large chunks of pre-IPO Facebook shares, without providing investors access to the company’s financials or the opportunity to speak with CEO Mark Zuckerberg. You really should not invest in a private company without first talking to the CEO. How can you bet on the team if you haven’t talked with them? This is why we facilitate conversations through conference calls and our online forums. Speaking with the CEO will give you invaluable insights into leadership’s vision and ability to execute.

Do you share the vision and values of the CEO of the company? Reading about a company can never be as valuable as a conversation with the CEO. A friend of mine once heard an impassioned pitch from a CEO who had an intriguing company, but he spoke in militaristic metaphors about the marketplace as a battleground and the need to defeat competitors. His approach toward his market and his appeal to investors on military terms was off-putting. Prospective angel investors would never have known that had they not talked to him face-to-face.
Can the CEO and leadership team execute their vision? There are plenty of great business concepts and product ideas out there. It is in the execution phase where most companies stumble. You have to talk to a CEO to truly understand the risks associated with execution and to decide if you believe in the company and the CEO’s ability to deliver results.

**2) Have a Diversification Strategy (and execute on it).** It’s unlikely you will be a successful private investor if you’re putting money in just two or three companies. Data from the Kauffman Foundation suggests a sound approach is to have seven to 10 investments. The Angel Investment Performance Project, released by the Kauffman Foundation, found that angel investors generally had nine years of experience and averaged just over one investment per year. You need to determine how much you want to allocate to this asset class and then diversify your investments to reduce risk and increase your odds of success.

**3) Talk to an expert.** Find someone who knows the industry that interests you. I would recommend consulting a professional investor in the space or an investment banker focused on the category. Don’t know one? Start looking on LinkedIn – spending a few hours networking will help you realize there were questions you didn’t know you should ask.

**4) Talk to customers.** The more customer data you can get, the better. At a minimum, you should talk to three to five customers who use the product. You want to understand from first-hand users what’s to like about the product and what void does it fill. Is there an alternative product that customers say they would consider using in place of the product? Why or why not? What if a competitor drops prices—would they remain loyal? Most importantly, would they recommend the product? Customers come in three flavors: promoters who are loyal, will recommend a company’s products and services, and can help fuel growth; passives who are indifferent and easy pickings for competitors; and detractors who are unhappy and actively criticize. (In an ideal world you would do a Net Promoter Score survey, but that may not be realistic in every situation). Pay attention to the types of customers a company has; it’s a good sign if you hear them actually promoting the products they’re using.

**5) Understand growth.** How is the company growing and how will it continue to grow?  Has the business grown by acquiring distribution or has it been successful increasing sales at the same stores? Organic growth (read: same store sales growth) is far more valuable than buying growth. Obviously, to understand growth, an investor has to dig into the key financial statements—the balance sheet, income statement, and cash-flow statement. In the consumer sector you can ask for retail level sales (i.e. SPINs data) to help answer that question.

**6) Know the exit strategy.** Know the exit scenarios for the industry that interests you. How big will the business need to be, and with what margins, to go public or be an attractive acquisition target? If an IPO is not in its future, who are potential buyers when it reaches that ideal scale?

In consumer and retail, IPOs are more rare than tech, so at CircleUp we always ask: “Who will buy this business in 5 years?” M&amp;A is actually more common in consumer than in other industries. The value of M&amp;A in the consumer space was nearly double the value of Internet and software deals in 2012, according to the most recent year-in-review data from PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP.

**7) Talk with your lawyer. ** Legal documents associated with investing in private companies are complicated. Show every document to your lawyer for feedback.  You may not care about all of your lawyer’s points, but you should understand them.

**8) Understand the business.** Follow Peter Lynch’s investment maxim “Invest in what you know.” Before investing in a company, use the product, study the business. Lynch invested in Hanes in the early 1970s because his wife liked its L’Eggs pantyhose line. The better you understand the business, the more confident you’ll feel about your investment. Why would you invest in a tech company if you don’t have a tech background?  Do you understand how to diligence the next hot mobile app or the technology trends that will impact it? Stick to what you know well.

**9) Calculate the per unit economics.** Amazingly, many companies in recent years have attracted investors despite the fact that they lose money on each “unit” they sell. Sadly for their investors, many of these companies also have no plan to change that situation. If you’re investing in a beverage company, you should understand how much it makes—or loses—on each bottle. The formula is simple: revenue minus full costs, including marketing and distribution costs.

**10) Know the deal.** Determine how a company’s valuation and deal structure stacks up against others in the industry. Look at the valuation relative to comparable companies based on multiple factors, including revenue, net income, growth rate, risk profile and capital structure. Good companies are not always good investments—especially if the valuation is too high. As Warren Buffett once said, “Never count on making a good sale. Have the purchase price be so attractive that even a mediocre sale gives good results.”

Because we’ve had over a thousand companies apply to my equity crowdfunding site, we’re in a unique position to help provide data that investors need to benchmark consumer-goods companies against their peers. That’s a good start but the key is to do your diligence.  Ultimately, any investor needs to obtain as much information as possible about the business, the industry and the deal. There are no sure bets, but the more you know, the better your odds of success.

27,2015-06-30,afuiowa2014,12,Are you worried that you're not worried about Greece?,"Most of us fancy ourselves contrarians. It's in a lot of people's nature to go against the grain.

So when we see a headline like ""Stocks fall as Street fears Grexit"" or something similar, we scoff. We brush Greece off as some small, inconsequential basket case of a nation with an economy the size of (insert large U.S. city here).

It seems like more people than not are taking the view that Greece won't ultimately affect us. We see ourselves as contrarians by dismissing the possibility that Grexit could affect the U.S. economy and therefore our stock exchanges.

But I don't think we're contrarians--I think we're overlooking this. I think the contrarians are actually concerned about Greece because most average investors are not. I don't know why, and I can't completely explain it, but it just doesn't feel right. If Greece is not a big deal, why did the S&amp;P have its worst sell-off in years today?

I know about as much as any average investor about the Greece situation, mostly because I never figured it'd be a serious idea to spend time reading about. But now I'm starting to worry that it doesn't seem like other people are worried.

We've got a ""just buy the dip, Greece doesn't matter!"" mentality. Most people are convinced this will blow over in a couple weeks. But isn't that how we get burned? Big market crashes are so bad specifically because few people see them coming, or they brush off the warning signs.

I'm wondering if our ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ attitude towards Greece could burn us worse than many think is possible. Again, I can't explain why. I can't bust out data points and figures and this and that to back up my case. I just don't like the fact that so few people seem concerned, including myself.

Anyone feel the same?"

Commodities are starting to trend upward and are more promising than ever. Investors are continually annoyed by the zero gains the markets have provided for them and with it oil &amp; gold are both up. Rising oil prices signal a boost to the U.S. shale industry, and gold going up could mean a weaker dollar. Currency traders and investors of energy companies should take note.

The three big Asian markets are all down. The Nikkei 225 at -.25%, Hang Seng a big -1.12% drop, and the Shanghai Composite down -.15%. The Hang Seng bear markets were lead by China Shenhua with a close to 4% drop, and Bankcomm down 3.36%. The MSCI's delay on inclusion of Chinese stocks lead the downfall, they believe they are not ready. More data is also showing a sputtering economy with little room for its past rapid growth as vehicle sales fall. The Nikkei was dragged down by transportation and automotive companies with West Japan Railway, Toyota, Isuzu, and Hino Motors all down over 2% (Hino Motors down a staggering 4.25%).

European markets show a positive trend after being shaky for a couple months now. FTSE is up .4%, DAX 1.17%, and CAC 40 .67%. Deutsche Post is leading the DAX rally, going up 2.3% and still increasing. Tesco on the FTSE is up over 4% after coming down from a 52 week high of 298 to now 210. Greek talks are still unclear, and a resolution is not exactly imminent. 

S&amp;P 500 and Dow futures followed Europe's trend with both up over .3%. The green numbers might be as a result of investor's moving over from overvalued bonds to equities once again. Pimco Total Return Fund, a bond fund, has sold billions of dollars in U.S. debt.

On a more micro level Fiat Chrysler's CEO calls investors to push for a GM merger. Bayer is also selling their diabetes unit to Panasonic for $1.15 billion. Target announced a share buyback program, something that Goldman Sachs' CEO has warned against. Share buyback according to him was not the smart move, but leaving money for mergers &amp; acquisitions would be a better strategy. Spotify could be a huge IPO as its fierce competition with Apple is escalating, and is now valued at $8.2 billion.

30,2015-07-31,klabboy,10,Fundamental Analysis outline.,"I wrote up a little quick outline of fundamental analysis for my friend. He knows hardly anything about investment strategies and wants to learn more. I recommended him to investopedia and I was considering sending him this little outline. Just thought I'd run it past you guys to see if I miss anything major. I don't want to lead him astray. 

It's quite long. so sorry for the wall of text. Just would like your thoughts. 

Fundamental Analysis: 


Qualitative data research 


1.	Understand their business model and how they make money
2.	Management- 


a.	Conference calls- what type of answers do they provide? 


b.	Management Discussion and Analysis- read the last 5 years. Found at the beginning of the Annual report 
c.	Ownership and insider trades- check to see if management is selling their shares or being paid in stock vs cash. Bad sign if selling stock. 


d.	Past performance- check the CEO’s performance in other companies. 


3.	Corporate Governance-


a.	Financial transparency 


b.	How independent is the board of directors of a company?  Or is there an incentive to protect their CEOs? 


4.	The Industry- 


a.	Customers- how large is their customer base? Or small? Will they continue to get customers? 


b.	Market share- what’s it’s present market share, this could help to sway the industry in their favor, if big enough. 


c.Industry Growth- Will the industry continue to grow? Or will companies need to steal customers from their competitors to keep it up. 

d.	Competition- Higher # of competitors? How much pricing power does the firm of interest have?  


e.	Regulations of the industry- will a small change in regulation greater affect the bottom line of this business? 


Qualitative data research 


1.	Balance Sheet- 


a.	Assets= Liabilities+ shareholders/equity 


b.	Assets-


i.	Current assets- Assets that will likely be turned into cash within a year. (Cash, Inventories, and accounts receivable). 


1.	A growing cash reserve is often good. However, if it’s a long-term trend it could mean poor management. 


ii.	Inventory turnover- how quickly a company moves their product to the consumer. If it grows quicker than sales this is bad.

 
iii.	Receivables- uncollected debts


1.	A long collection period is might be bad. They might be trying to increase sales through manipulation of their finances. 


iv.	Current liabilities- debts, which must be paid within a year. 


1.	Companies with higher assets than debts are in decent shape.

 
2.	Look for quick ratio or Current assets-inventories/ current liabilities=QR. The Quick Ratio tells you if the company has enough money to cover their short term debts and obligations.  


v.	Equity- represents what the shareholders own. 


1.	Retained earnings- the amount of money companies chose to reinvest rather than give to their shareholders. 


a.	Look at how much return they get for their re-investment. 

2.	Income statement- snapshot of the company’s performance over a period of time. 


a.	Look for continued growth in their revenue


b.	Expenses that are decreasing is a good sign, unless it’s R&amp;D in a drug company. 


c.	High gross margins or money left over after the cost of sales. Good if this is increasing. Also good if it’s higher than their competition. They’re less likely to go into bankruptcy during a recession. 


d.	Net Income- What most people refer to as profits. 


3.	Cash flow- Hard to fake cash, some think it’s a better conservative estimate of company performance


a.	Positive cash from operating is good


b.	Watch for a big gap in reported earnings and cash from operating. 


c.	Cash flow from investing- 


i.	Firms should re-invest the amount of deprecation each year.

 
d.	Cash flow from financing-  Bank borrowing, sale of stock, and bonds. 


e.	most investors like the company to be able to pay for it’s own investments. Thus free flow cash is important. The calculation is: Net income +Amortization/depreciation- changes in working capital- capital expenditures= free cash flow.   


Where to find stuff 


Generally most of this is found on the company’s website. 


4.	Balance sheet, Income statement, and Cash flow statement can be found in the 10-Q and 10-K. More quantitative data can be found in the MD&amp;A  (management discussion and Analysis).


a.	10-K- discloses business performance over the year


b.	10-Q- discloses performance at each quarter


5.	Auditor’s report- Independent CPA firm looks at the company and decides if their financials are trust worthy or not.   


6.	Foot Notes- 
a.	Accounting methods- watch out if they change it up often. Could be a sign of attempting to hide bad finances.


b.	Disclosure- other stuff that was left out to keep things clean in the reports. These are worth a look.

The format is kind of fucked but hopefully it's still readable. So I would like some thoughts. Do you think i shouldn't put what to look for in it? Should I let him draw his own conclusions? Is there something huge I left out? Thanks!

31,2015-07-24,Willpower_is_all,24,Robert Shiller: The Housing Market Still Isn't Rational,"""Home prices have been climbing. They have risen 27 percent nationally since 2012, even more in places like San Francisco. But why worry? If you accept the efficient markets theory — and believe that real estate is an efficient market — then these prices are based on “new information,” even if you don’t know what that information is.

The problem with this kind of thinking is that the efficient markets theory is at best a half-truth, as a voluminous literature on market anomalies shows. What’s more, even that half-truth is grounded mainly in the stock market, which attracts professional investors who sometimes do make the market behave efficiently.



The housing market is another matter. It is far less rational than even the often irrational stock market, for a couple of important reasons. First, most investors find it difficult to understand how housing supply responds to changes in demand. Only a small minority of people think carefully about such things. Second, it is very hard for the minority of smart-money investors who do understand such matters to bet against bubble-level prices in real estate markets. In housing, the smart money has relatively little voice.


For the first point, in “A Nation of Gamblers: Real Estate Speculation and American History,” a presentation at the 2013 American Economic Association convention, Edward L. Glaeser of Harvard University reviewed real estate booms and busts. He showed how real estate investors have repeatedly made the mistake of neglecting the supply response to rising prices. In the Alabama cotton farmland boom of 1815 to 1819, for example, high cotton prices seemed to justify high prices for cotton land. What most investors failed to see at the time was that these cotton prices would induce new farmers around the world to begin to grow cotton. That same failure to anticipate how supply can respond to demand applies to many forms of real estate today. Developers and builders will, one way or another, exploit overpricing, increasing effective supply, in that way bringing real estate prices down.

For the second point, in 1977 Edward M. Miller pointed out in The Journal of Finance something that should have been obvious: Efficient markets require the possibility of selling short. In the stock market, for example, with short-selling, people who think the market is overpriced and headed for a fall can borrow shares and sell the borrowed shares at the current high price. If share prices do indeed fall, they can buy the shares back at a lower price and repay the loan, with a profit.

Short-selling helps prevent bubbles from forming, but such negative bets cannot easily occur in the housing market. You can’t routinely borrow a house and sell it, promising to buy back the same house later to repay the loan.

Markets without the possibility of making these negative bets will be inefficient. That’s because if it is not possible to short, the smart money can do no more than avoid holding an overpriced asset. Canny traders are forced to sit on the sidelines, and watch in futility as prices decline as they expected. Without short-sellers, there is nothing to stop a group of ignorant investors — who get some ill-conceived idea that a certain investment is just terrific — from bidding up prices to extravagant levels. In the housing market, that poses an enormous problem.

Suppose that you are convinced housing prices are too high. How can you profit from this insight? You might consider shorting the residential real estate investment trusts (REITs) that invest in residential properties and are themselves traded on stock exchanges. However, REIT prices do not have a consistent correlation with housing prices, and tend to resemble stock prices instead. For example, the housing market declined in the two years after the March 2009 bottom of the stock market. The S &amp; P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index fell 6 percent over this period. But, over that same time interval, the S &amp; P 500 Residential REIT index tripled in value. Clearly, shorting this index would have been a bad move, even though a bet that housing prices would decline was spot on.

During the financial crisis, some professional investors did manage to profit by correctly forecasting home price declines. They used mortgage derivatives such as collateralized debt obligations to place their bets. John Paulson of Paulson &amp; Company is well known for very successfully profiting from his prediction of trouble in the housing market. But mortgages are not homes, and he and others like him did not beat down the emerging housing bubble before it grew out of proportion.

In 2006, in collaboration with several colleagues and me, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange set up a futures market for single-family homes in 10 United States cities. This market is still going today, but it is not very active and it can be used to place only a small bet that home prices will fall.

Still, despite rising prices, at present, exuberant investors do not dominate the domestic housing market over all. The Pulsenomics survey of household heads in January showed that national home price expectations are modest: on average increases of only 3.7 percent a year are expected for the next 10 years.

Extravagant expectations do lurk in parts of the market. In the 2015 Yale School of Management survey of recent home buyers that Karl Case of Wellesley College, Anne Thompson of Dodge Data and Analytics and I direct, our preliminary results confirmed the overall Pulsenomics conclusion yet found that some people have strikingly unrealistic expectations.

In San Francisco, for example, we found that while the median expectation for annual home price increases over the next 10 years was only 5 percent, a quarter of the respondents said they thought prices would increase each year by 10 percent or more. That would mean a net 150 percent increase in a decade. These people are apparently not thinking about the supply response that so big a price increase would generate. People like this could bid prices in some places so high that eventually the local market will collapse. Yet the smart money can’t find a profitable way to correct such errors today.

The bottom line is that there is no reason to assume that the real estate market is even close to efficient. You may want to buy a house if you love it and can afford it. But remember that you cannot safely rely on “comparable sales” to judge that the price is fair. The market isn’t efficient enough for that.""

In China's [股市:贴吧](http://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%E8%82%A1%E5%B8%82&amp;ie=utf-8), a China's version of reddit(with Chinese characteristics), there exists a subreddit that is themed on and about China's stock market.  The way the Chinese think about stock market is totally different from us, and I think their point of views on a few topics are quite interesting:

1. Why are the stock market dropping?

c110972 says: Today, we reap what we sow yesterday.  Let's start with the investigation on margin trading.  In the past, when in bull market, margin trade investigation will at best create a single 10% mid-term drop. No matter what you do, even with stamp duty and super short sell, still we won't be able to create the drop like today.  China stock market is a super mutant.  Stock market value very high, dividend very low.  Most stock do not have investment value, everyone are speculating on rise and drops, no different from casinos. The only function of the stock market, is to allow companies to create gambling chips for people sell into the stock market for real cash, it doesn't matter what the chips are made out of.

For those who can read Chinese, you can see people's replies in [here](http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3877438965), most agree with him, however, pes2068 says other wise:

&gt; The country is busy with AIIB, China's stock market tanks, is this a coincidence? Of course not, it's the American and Japanese's fault! Every country are watching us, we must win this war on finance!  The index is the key, we win, AIIB can open successfully! Today the big companies are showing signs of weakness, oil, bank, insurance and broker firms are starting to protect their share prices, all the data shows that our country is very efficient at handling matters when the stock market crises happen, showing responsibility worthy of this great country! To be a children of Chinese we can deeply feel the love and bountifulness of this land.  When small time investors are under fire from the stock market crises, the regularities, broker firms, stock funds have joint hands to launch a unionized assault, protecting the share prices together. Central bank is giving stock broker liquidity support.  Do not fall before sun rise! Believe in the capability of the government in saving the stock market!  It is the Chinese government, with guts and capabilities, who will protect the small investors of our motherland time and time again.  Believe!

Sorry, I need to take a break to laugh, more translations coming

2. What are we gonna do when the stock market tanks?

winnie200 said:

&gt;Citizens of China need to unite together! To protect the chinese stocks is to protect yourself! Buy!

&gt;Instead of insulting you should unite, support china! The stock market crisis is going to affact everyone!

&gt;The next step of a financial crisis, not only investors and financial institutes will be the ones negatively affected.  A lot of physical will also be affected.  Domestic demand will decrease, finance shrivel, exchange rate stability goes away, currency depreciate, first we will have deflation, then we will have bad inflation, every industry goes bankrupt, like what happened to Thailand and Korea in 1997. If this happen, will civil unrest happen?  We can't imagine that.  Under this condition, our currency will no longer be any safe asset, we will have to accept a totally different lifestyle.

&gt;For the country, for yourself, everyone buy 100 shares!

The others do not quite agree.  For example, fly飞翔的番茄 told winnie200:

&gt;OP should sell every he has, including his house, to buy in the stock market.  If he doesn't, he is unpatriotic, nation traitor!

37,2015-08-20,suptho,2,World drowns in oil as producers slug it out,"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/19/world-drowns-in-oil-as-producers-slug-it-out-.html

Oil prices continue to crater, and the bottom remains elusive because not one of the world's three largest producers shows any sign of blinking.

The latest leg down for crude came with U.S. weekly inventory data Wednesday which showed a surprise supply build of 2.6 million barrels last week, while analysts had expected a drop. West Texas Intermediate futures plunged 4.3 percent to $40.80 per barrel, a new six-year low.

""What we tend to think is these low prices will be around in our forecast for a couple of quarters,"" said Eric Lee, energy analyst at Citigroup. Analysts believe ultimately low prices should stop some of the production that is driving a supply glut, but that has not happened as quickly as experts had previously projected.

WTI oil futures look set to fall into the $30s per barrel, a low range that many analysts had previously not targeted. While Citigroup has been saying a drop into the $30s was possible, the latest revision to its official base case price outlook put WTI crude at an average $39 per barrel in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year.

Oil analysts say forecasting the timing of a bottom in prices has been particularly difficult because of the unknowns around U.S. production, and most have now extended their forecasts for low oil well into next year.

But the two other producers in the top three are bigger, and they have each also had a significant impact on world supply, with no sign of abating.

Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest exporter, has been able to use its low cost base to put even more oil onto the world market. And Russia's dramatically weakened currency turns into a positive at home, helping the largest crude producer to lower production costs for its own oil industry.

An executive at Russia's state-owned Gazprom Neft Wednesday said Russian oil firms are weathering low prices and will continue to increase output even if Saudi Arabia drives prices lower with increased production.

""Today's prices haven't yet turned into a shock for the global oil industry. Many people hoped that it would hit the U.S. shale industry first and foremost but it hasn't happened so far,"" said Vadim Yakovlev, first deputy chief at Gazprom Neft told Reuters. ""That tells me that ... the Saudis could try to test new levels of resilience."" Yakovlev said production at many projects can stay viable even at $25 to $30 a barrel.

Citigroup expects Russian production to grow steadily and sees it up by 100,000 barrels a day this year to about 11.1 million barrels a day. It expects Saudi Arabia to produce about 10.2 million barrels a day, after hitting a record high this spring. Citi analysts see Saudi production at just under the 10 million barrel a day level next year.

These and other smaller producers, who have been aggressively battling each other for market share in Asia, continue to add to the more than 1 million barrel a day world oil glut. That makes finding the market bottom difficult.

""It is tricky,"" said Lee. ""Fundamentally, it makes a lot of sense that the fourth quarter of this year looks particularly bad because refining demand drops and driving season drops off ... if you get through the fourth quarter and you still have this oversupply, then maybe it's the second quarter of next year when you have this drop off in demand again.""

A number of oil analysts expect the next big drop, and possible bottom in prices, to come when the U.S. refining industry shuts down some capacity for maintenance between early September and early November. That industry has been processing about 17 million barrels a day, and refining maintenance would take 1 million to 1.5 million barrels off the run rate.

One surprising factor has been that U.S. shale producers have proven more agile with costs and technology than expected, and U.S. production is off its high but fairly steady at the 9.3 million barrel a day level, according to the latest EIA weekly data.
The agency also reported a sharp jump in U.S. imports to 8 million barrels a day in the past week, from 7.6 million barrels the week earlier.

""That was one of the most surprising statistics this week,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. ""The U.S. remains an outlet for countries trying to maintain their market share of crude oil sales.""

Citigroup and other firms have changed their price forecasts to show a more prolonged downturn in prices that could ultimately cause a shakeout among producers. Lee said the factors that affect producers include production costs, storage costs and financial flows.

The swift drop in prices makes the financing environment more dicey for exploration and production companies this fall. In October, banks are set to review the credit lines of companies in the oil patch, and they are expected to clamp down.

""We're slowing down a little bit and a lot of investments have been canceled or postponed or delayed,"" said Lipow. ""It's just going to take some time to soak up the oversupply situation as the market anticipates the return of Iranian oil.""

When it comes to costs of production, Russia and Saudi Arabia have a big advantage over the U.S. Saudi Arabia's production is less than $10 a barrel, while Russia also has some production under $10, according to Citigroup.

U.S. shale producers, meanwhile, have varied costs depending on where they are located. Some of the high-cost production is already shut in, and Citigroup sees a cluster of production in the $30 per barrel area. Analysts and traders who took the CNBC Oil Survey last week were split on the break-even price for frackers, with 43 percent of the participants saying it was $45 to $55 per barrel.
Read MoreCNBC Survey: Oil prices seen below break even for frackers

While Russia and Saudi are lower-price producers, their economies are much more reliant on the contributions from oil.

""Their (Saudi Arabia's) fiscal break-even price of oil is hard to measure exactly. Some people peg it at $80 or $90. That's how much they need the price to be to balance their budget ... so they need to cut back spending,"" said Lee. ""By raising production, they do grow their revenues and bring down their break-even price. ... The other thing is they did not borrow and have massive borrowing power. ... We do think they are trimming costs."" 

Citigroup late last week revised down its forecast for oil prices, with a base case for $54 Brent this year. Citi analysts see $50 for Brent in the current quarter and $47 in the fourth quarter. They expect those price levels to stick through the first half of next year, with an average $53 per barrel Brent price for 2016.

For WTI, Citigroup expects the price this year and next year to be $48 per barrel, with the average third-quarter price $45 and the fourth-quarter price $39 per barrel. Citi gives a 55 percent probability to this base case.

Lee said Saudi Arabia is going head to head with other Mideast producers for share in Asia, where there is a 20 million to 25 million barrel a day oil deficit.

""A lot of the focus is on China. The Saudis are competing with the UAE, Iraq and Russia,"" he said. Saudi Arabia lost its spot as top exporter to both China and India in the spring, and more recently in Japan, according to Citigroup.

""That's the battleground within the battleground,"" said Lee of Asia.

For that reason, production may stay elevated as producers drive product into markets where they would like to build market share.

Lipow said one factor that could change things quickly would be an unanticipated geopolitical event that affects oil supply or threatens it.

""This is a type of market that has completely discounted any potential geopolitical risk,"" he said. ""You're not even hearing anyone talking about that. The market is so beside itself in bearishness, that's not even in the market's thinking."""

If you are able to get a somewhat reliable algorithm going based off of Twitter and Google Trends, why not expand it? Has someone expanded it already?

I feel like you could use APIs from the top 100 websites in the world to build a relational database and create a set of criteria (an algorithm) to help predict movement in the stock market. For a PoC you could look at 20 companies within a 6 month window and correlate their price fluctuation based on what you scrapped from the top 100 sites within that same time frame. By looking at keywords, events, company info, stock info. I would think 10% of the decision on predicting movement would be based on actual stock info (EPS, P/E, PEG, etc) and the other 90% would be speculation based on the top 100 sites. From those sites you would be indexing keywords (positive and negative), PRs, promotions, new tech releases... pretty much anything that can be indexed will be index and given a value (from 1-10) of how positive and negative the words are. From there you would be able to heat map your criteria from the database and look for a trend or pattern related to price fluctuations in market prices.


I am sure people already have some variation of this program and if they do I would like to be pointed in the right direction as to where to find it. That way I can get more ideas of what is currently in use and implement it into my own creation. I have a lot more detail swirling around on my head on how to make this great and I am just trying to get the general idea out there. Any feedback is appreciated. I am also cross posting this to /r/programming."

EDIT: [Here is the list](http://i.imgur.com/dtkOLM5.png). The highlighted ones are in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, 

I have a tonne of time to kill this week and was looking to occupy it with some stocks to value. 

Rather than do it just for me, I thought I would value stocks that /r/investing wanted. 

**The proposal:**

- Post the company you would like valued. Others vote it up or down. 
- The 10 companies that have the most votes by end of day Monday (11:59pm EST on August 3, 2015) are the ones I will value.
- I'll post the results of each valuation in a separate thread by the end of this week for everyone to judge.

**Rules:**

- No penny stocks
- No pre-revenue companies 
- Less popular is better. I'm not sure what value I can add by being the 10 millionth person to value Apple or Tesla or IBM. Go beyond the ""big boys"". It'll be more interesting that way. [READ THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3fk5u9/i_have_time_to_kill_what_stock_do_you_want_valued/ctpo1ov) &amp; [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3fk5u9/i_have_time_to_kill_what_stock_do_you_want_valued/ctpo82v)
- No Resource stocks. They are reliant on commodity prices and that is something I don't feel comfortable projecting out into the future. But I can take a pass at it if people want

**My Promise:**

- Complete Objectivity. I will use only that which I can objectively justify with data as far as possible
- Full transparency. I'll post all my assumptions, thought processes and sources and I'll be around to answer any questions
- A Comfort Rating. I'll rate each valuation from 1 to 5 to illustrate how comfortable I am with the numbers that went into it. For example, a valuation of ConEd would get 4 or 5 because it is easy to know most things about that company great accuracy. it's revenues and margins are regulated and not much is going to change about its market

Hope this is something people are interested in. 


EDIT: grammar, many missing words and a re-wording to make things succinct 

EDIT 2: I have no way to police this, but no vote manipulation okay? play nice

**EDIT 3: Foreign companies are welcome as long as they have filings in English!** I can read some french and italian but it'd be a mess

EDIT 4: I am silently judging all of you on your comment histories. Some of you are fucked up"
40,2015-09-20,queensgambit52,17,eking advice on optimal execution of Airbnb-affiliated REIT,"Not sure if forming a REIT is optimal or if managing specific individual's investments would be better, but the gist of my situation is:

- In 2 months, my good friend will be receiving a 10 figure acquisition of his company, provided SEC doesn't discover any monopoly issues (they won't, it's a small acquisition relative to the field size). He's CEO and a lot of the execs, including him, are being replaced or retiring. I will essentially have access, through my friend, to about 7-10 individuals with 8 figures in the bank looking for new investments.

- I've been running an Airbnb business for the last 4 years. We buy properties in zip codes that appear to be profitable via various data sets I've purchased (I have purchase price to rental income [gross airbnb revenue] ratios per zip code in the US), furnish them and turn them into vacation rentals. We have in-field teams in each city that manage each of our listings, and an online management that handles all communication for 3%. It's all very automated. Currently we only have 9 listings, but our ROI on pure cashflow (not including appreciation) has been pretty absurd. For properties we put 25% down, the average return has been around 32%. For cash buys, around 12-15%. If I exclude the money going into principal on the 25% down properties as an expense, it gets closer to 38-40%. 

- I'm likely running above expectation, and as each city gets more saturated with more VRs my income will decrease, however I still have other cities I haven't purchased in/tapped into and I think even 10% would be appealing to the average investor. All of our listings are 5-stars, we respond 24/7 within 1-hour and we use some neat pricing algorithm software so this likely contributes to our over performance. I also recognize that there is legislation in the works to ban/regulate/tax Airbnbs in many cities (e.g. Santa Monica, SF, NYC) - fortunately we're not in any those. Personally I believe Airbnb/VRBO/Flipkey is too big to stop unless the city hires dedicated staff to monitor and regulate, but if a ban did occur then the REIT/LLC/whatever I end up doing would take a hit and I would either sell/move to another city or put in a long term tenant for less return.

My question is: what is the best strategy to get these execs to invest with me? 

Option A) Form a separate LLC with each investor with a min investment amount, and acquire some type of asset loan with higher interest for each LLC to leverage into more properties? 

Option B) Know close to nothing about this, but form an REIT to handle all investments. This option seems more easily scalable.

Option C) ???

I also forgot to mention that the CEO bought two properties through me exactly 1 year ago and we did 15.8% our first year together. I approached him with this idea a few days ago when I learned about the acquisition and he seemed open to it."

When viewing it as a table by month, what I extract is this: the mean values are not useful as they tend to be biased by spikes, but median values show that consistently since 1990, and with no variation except in the past five years, the median value of the S&amp;P500 has been 20, not 15.  

Since 2010 however, the median value has been about 17, only recently passing 20, then falling below it in the past month.  

A lot of guidance as to how 'overbought' the market is has centered on the idea that historical data matters, but since the late 80s we have diverged markedly from historical trends.  

While I've been bearish as fuck this year based on the ending of artificial market buoying of the fed, I am inclined to think that we never really overinflated stocks all *that* much.  

The big thing that stands out to me in that is just how much cash many of these companies have built up.

In recent years, some private equity firms have bought universities and turned them into for-profits. 

Apple is a for-profit corporation not a charity but there are plenty of ways to make money from a non-profit university. Aside from the tax breaks and other deductions, Apple University would be a proving ground for educational technologies that would be sold to every other university in the world. New textbooks built for the iPad and its successors would greatly increase the demand for iPads. Apple-designed courses built using online technologies, a.i. tutors, and virtual reality experimental worlds could become the leading form of education worldwide. Big data analytics from Apple University textbooks and courses would lead to new and better ways of teaching. 

As a new university, Apple could experiment with new ways of organizing degrees and departments and certifying knowledge. Campuses in Delhi, Seoul, Shanghai, Berlin, and Sao Paulo could provide opportunities for studying abroad. Apple’s reputation would attract top students, especially, for example, if it started with a design and business school. Top students would lead Apple University to be highly ranked. The more prestigious Apple University became the greater would be the demand for Apple University educational products.

Apple already has the beginning of this model with iTunes U and its own internal Apple University for training in business and design. By buying a university, Apple would commit to a learning process to develop these technologies in entirely new ways.

Sounds great, huh?"
44,2015-10-28,Kolachampagne,8,Carl Icahn's letter to AIG,"http://carlicahn.com/aig-ceo-letter/

Dear Peter:

It is my experience that in Corporate America, even when all available data points to the same undeniable conclusion and when all stakeholders desire the same mutually beneficial outcome, an external force is often still required to effect meaningful and positive change. This is the current situation in which AIG shareholders find themselves. The company continues to severely underperform its peers and is now facing an increasingly onerous regulatory burden which will only further erode its competitive position. Despite definitive action on the part of Congress and regulators to encourage this company to become smaller and simpler by splitting up, you have shown no sign of urgency and have chosen a “wait and see…for years” strategy void of decisive leadership. As a result AIG consistently trades at a substantial discount to book value.  It is a “no-brainer” that the simple act of splitting this company up will greatly enhance shareholder value.  AIG should immediately:

Pursue tax free separations of both its life and mortgage insurance subsidiaries to create three independent public companies. Each would be small enough to mitigate and avert the Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) designation.
Embark on a much needed cost control program to close the gap with peers.
We believe there is no more need for procrastination, the time to act is now. I have already heard from several large shareholders who are frustrated with the lack of clear progress and are supportive of an AIG break up. I cannot fathom how you could ignore repeated requests from shareholders to execute a plan that would release billions of dollars of capital, free the company from onerous excess regulation, and leave shareholders owning stock in three separate, market leading insurance franchises.

“AIG is frankly overdue in following in the footsteps of all other major multi-lines in breaking up Life and P&amp;C into separate companies.  By separating into three independent companies, reducing unnecessary corporate overhead, operating at average industry returns, and buying back stock, AIG can trade at over $100 per share – 66% above its current $60 price,” John Paulson, President, Paulson &amp; Co. Inc.

 

Too Big to Succeed

“We’re beginning to see discussions that these capital charges are sufficiently large it’s causing those firms to think seriously about whether or not they should spin off some of the enterprises to reduce their systemic footprint, and frankly, that’s exactly what we want to see happen.”  Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, February 2014

Despite years of dismantling and selling non-core assets, AIG is still too large. The combination of life insurance and p&amp;c insurance into a single entity offers no net benefit to shareholders (proven by industry low ROE), a fact that has driven other major multiline insurers to aggressively focus on a single line of business.  We believe you must acknowledge that the current multiline strategy is not generating competitive returns. Separate monoline companies will be more focused, more efficient, generate better returns and, as a result, command significantly higher market valuations.

Additionally, “Because of AIG’s size and interconnectedness” the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has deemed AIG a non-bank SIFI, subjecting the company to Federal Reserve oversight and increased capital requirements. We believe you must acknowledge that enhanced regulation is intended to be a tax on size, designed to approximate the cost that large companies impose on the financial system. The regulators have made clear that the best outcome is for SIFI’s to shrink and “reduce their systemic footprint.” If nothing is done, returns and AIG’s competitive position will continue to suffer as the SIFI regulation, including its costs and capital requirements, is fully implemented.

“The other way it [the FSOC Designation Process] can make the system safer is by providing an incentive for designated companies to change their structure or operations so they can reduce the risk they pose and change their designation and the amount of oversight. In many ways [this] outcome is more desirable than the first because it would allow business to find the more efficient way to reduce the risk they pose to the economy.” Senator Elizabeth Warren at Secretary Lew’s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,  March 2015

We believe you should immediately pursue, in the quickest and most efficient manner, a separation of both life and mortgage insurance from the core p&amp;c insurance business. We believe all three companies would be small enough to avert the increased capital requirements and regulations associated with non-bank SIFI status. In the face of a changing and potentially punitive regulatory framework, you must realize that insurance businesses of AIG’s caliber are more valuable to shareholders if held directly than they are as part of a SIFI conglomerate.

 

Competitive Cost Structure

AIG’s ROE is below its peers not only because of size and capital constraints, but also because of lack of cost control. You have acknowledged that returns are below peers and must be improved, even going so far as to provide a long-term ROE goal of 10%, which is still below peers. At the same time you have suggested returns would not increase by more than 0.5% per year. Amazingly you have turned the quest for a 10% ROE into a half decade journey. The one thing we do agree on is AIG’s lack of competitiveness. Do you honestly think now is not the time for the inevitable AIG transformation?  You must be proactive and commit to closing 100% of the ROE gap between AIG and its peers.

It is now incumbent upon you to explain why, despite pressure from the stock price, regulators, and shareholders, the company should not take immediate and transformative action. Achieving these two goals in combination with continued share repurchases is the only realistic path to a healthy and competitive company and, more importantly, exceed the potential of any alternative plan. AIG has taken too long already and we hope you come to the same conclusion.  Time is of the essence.  We look forward to engaging with management, the Board, and shareholders.

Sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Carl C. Icahn"

**When the cash machine is broke**

*The dangers of buying a stock whose earnings are less than its dividends*

There is no data on the future. And no “system” works consistently on the stock market. This keeps the professionals guessing and often scares the rest of us. But as Warren Buffett is at pains to repeat:

&gt; The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future.

Ignore the cash flow potential of a business at your peril. Perhaps the brightest signal on cash flows are the dividends you get.

**When dividends are higher than earnings**

Dividends can only be paid out of profit. So it’s rare to see dividends that are higher than earnings, but it does happen.

In the case where the board is giving a *special* dividend, there is rarely a case for alarm. If fact the market usually cheers the extra cash payment.

But if earnings have fallen, albeit temporarily, and the board decides not to cut the dividend, there may be cause to sell out. It’s a warning signal. Not fool proof, but it’s a flag all the same.

**A warning? Why?**

It all comes down to the word temporary. Look what the recent collapse in oil prices, has done to the earnings of the oil majors. Is this temporary or permanent?

If the hit to earnings is temporary, then a company’s board may decide to keep the dividend payment flat on the previous year. Even if forecast earnings falls below dividends, the board can dip into the company’s reserves to maintain the dividend. If they decide to live with a dividend / earnings imbalance, the signal to shareholders and the stock market is one of confidence. Confidence that the long-term cash potential of the company is intact.

Sticking with the example of the oil majors. Only one of them, Chevron, is in the dividend danger zone.
Earnings forecasts for 2015 are down 71% to $3.30 a share. But the expected dividend for 2015 is $4.31 a share, which exceeds earnings.

But with earnings forecast to expand again in 2016, to $4.45 a share, the dividend / earnings imbalance looks temporary. At least that is the forecast of the professionals on Wall Street.

**But what if the forecasts are wrong?**

If a temporary fall in earnings turns out to be permanent, then the impact is usually bad. Obvious, you might say? Yes, it is simple, the future cash flow potential has fallen.

The problem, though, is the speed the stock market reacts. It’s rare that earnings forecasts are cut, before the stock falls. Usually the stock prices falls before the professionals on Wall Street get to change their forecasts.

Similarly, by the time you realise that the dividend is going to be cut, and that the fall in earnings isn’t temporary, it’s also to late. You’d be:

&gt; Shutting the stable door, after the horse has bolted.

So what are you to do? Be vigilant. If the fundamentals of a business you’ve invested in start to get worse, reconsider your investment. It’s not a must sell, but you need to ask yourself one simple, but troubling, question:

&gt; If I didn’t own this stock today, would I buy it?

If the answer is no, then why on earth do you still own it? Don’t get emotionally attached to any investment.

**Let’s run the numbers!**

I ran the numbers for UK stocks back in March. There were 7 companies, worth over $1 billion, that were forecast to pay higher dividends than earnings. Two were giants, BP and Vodafone. Here’s what the picture looked like at the time.

Roll forward 6 months, and what’s happened to the earnings and dividend forecasts? Six of the seven companies have seen the forecast earnings decline with four of them seeing forecast dividends decline.

Did the changes in forecasts impact their prices? Yes, performance was universally negative.

Though we need to put this into the context of the stock market. In the UK, the big-cap index, FTSE 100 is off 14% over the same period. And the mid-cap index, FTSE 250 is off 4%.

**It’s just a flag, not a “system”**

So yes, the dividend / earnings imbalance was a flag, but in some cases (CWC, TalkTalk and Vodafone) the stocks have performed reasonably when compared to the market. How can that be?

Share prices are driven by two factors: the fundamentals, and; sentiment. It’s entirely possible for the fundamentals of a business to get worse, but for sentiment to not change/ even improve. Sentiment can be a powerful driver of stock prices in the short term. Booms and busts being extreme examples. To quote Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham:

&gt; In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.

So yes, it’s a flag that something bad may happen. But like any rule of thumb, there are many times it doesn’t hold. Especially in the short term.

**Forget the past, what about today?**

I hate price charts, as they tell me what I should have done 3 months ago, not what I should do today. Equally, you can accuse me of telling you about the fall of 7 major UK companies, after the fact. Your criticism is valid.

So why don’t we run the numbers today? Both US and UK.

*Dividends &gt; Earnings in the UK*

I doubt anyone’s surprised to see a mining and an oil stock on the list. Though a pharma and an insurance one is a little more mystifying.

*Dividends &gt; Earnings in the US*

The US list is oils heavy. Plus, given the size of the US stock market, I’ve only posted the 12 stocks with a value over $25 billion. To see the full list of 76 stocks over $5 billion with a dividend / earnings imbalance, please click this link for the data.

**And…what should you do?**

We don’t make recommendations or provide advice. We are highlighting a rule of thumb, a cautionary flag. So let’s roll forward 6 months, and see how the 18 companies above deal with their imbalance! I suspect it’s be a mixed bag.

And, if you are scratching your head and wondering what you should do? Well… be vigilant. To quote the economist John Maynard Keynes:

&gt; When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?

So if the fundamentals for any invest you’ve made change, it’ll be time to think again.

50,2015-11-12,ValueInvestor1981,0,State of the Market: Completely Insane,"This market is 100% crazy stupid.  Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn’t understand the history of valuations and their effect on returns and doesn’t care about protecting their capital long term.  Yes, the current P/E is not as bad as other valuation metrics, but P/E ratio is one of the least reliable valuation metrics because of how short term oriented it is.

The most reliable long term valuation metric is the stock market to GDP ratio, which Warren Buffett often refers to as the “single most reliable measure of stock market valuation at any given time.”  As of today, the future projected returns are projected to be 1% per year INCLUDING dividends. This means that taking dividends out, you would have to subtract 2% per year, roughly, from the total returns. How accurate is it?  When looking at past results, it is 92% accurate and the times it deviates is when the future returns only deviate because of massive overvaluation extremes, like now, or undervalued extremes such as 1982. 

So first off, if you don’t read above and think that the next 10 years in the stock market are going to be ugly, you need to take all of your money out of the stock market, bury it in the back yard, and remove yourself from society because you’re dense.

Look at the period around 1999/2000…if anyone remembers those times, expectations were of 15-20% returns for the rest of time.  If you don’t believe me, go look up articles from Barrons and other financial organizations and see what was said by “professional” money managers who were considered experts.  The scary part is, we aren’t that far off of that time right now! The annualized return expected over the next 10 years is around 1% per year! WITH DIVIDENDS!! Which is close to what it was back in 1999 and 2000, when expected returns were sub 0% even with dividends, and things played out exactly that way. For valuations today, that means that based on 92% correlation, we should expect the nominal market price of the S&amp;P to be LOWER in 10 years than it is today because taking out dividends takes the nominal price of the S&amp;P growth to negative territory!

Historically, the average stock market to GDP ratio has been in the 90% range and as Warren Buffett says, when you are in the 60-70% range, you will do quite well for the foreseeable future.  However, at the start of past secular bull markets, the ratio has gone as low as 42% before the big rises start, which means that prices are much lower based on history.  Why?  Well think about it…

The most important thing to future returns is how much you pay for an investment today.  Can an investment still do well even if you pay more for it today than you wanted to? Of course.  That happens all the time. I’ve successfully done it in real estate. But when you are investing in a broad base of companies, like any diversified portfolio should be, it will all average out.  So you need to pay as little as possible, as a whole. The less you pay, the more return you will get because over the long run, stocks will perform to their long term valuation levels.  In the short run, it’s a crap shoot.  As Warren Buffett always says “stocks are a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run.”  Which means that in the short run, the popular ones will do the best but in the long run, the fundamentals of cash and cash flow and revenue will be what determines success.

So in 1982, when the stock market to GDP ratio was around 42%, it would make sense that the following 18 years yielded 18% returns and when the stock market to GDP ratio was north of 1.5, as it is today, the following ten years produced very poor results.   Paying a higher price for anything will always take away future returns because returns are calculated on what you PAY for an investment.  The results will factor into your return as well, don’t get me wrong, but the income and cash flow are not at all affected by what you pay for the investment. They will be what they will be whether you pay $1 or $1MM for it.

10 Year Cyclically Adjust P/E Ratio

This was created many decades ago (earlier part of the 20th century) by the writers of Security Analysis, which is the Bible of value investing.  We all know that P/E is the price to earnings ratio and it can be applied to the market.  However, these guys understood that any given year can have massive fluctuations based on short term expenses or revenue gains that aren’t reflective of long term performance.  So what they did was even it out a bit by taking the present value of the previous 10 years of earnings and see where the market stood.  The historical average is around 16.6, and CURRENTLY we are at 27.  27! The only other time in HISTORY that it has been higher was 1999/2000.  In fact, all previous secular bear markets prior to 1999 started when the S&amp;P 10 year P/E was around 23-25! So we are even higher than what starts a 17-20 year flat stock market.

In past secular bull markets, the S&amp;P 10 Year P/E is in the single digits.  Usually around 6-9 so in this situation, for us to get to that level again, we would need the S&amp;P to go from 2100 today down to 700.  I know it sounds unfathomable but that’s where it would need to be to have the 10 year P/E at 9.  Is it a coincidence that when valuations are high, future returns are low and when valuations are low, future returns are high? Of course not.  Go back up and read my statements on paying more for an investment will always chip at your returns.  100% of the time.

I love watching CNBC and having all these pundits and experts talk about how we are in the early stages of a long term secular bull market.  Liz Ann Sonders is one person I love to pick on because she is the Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab and she should know much better.  But she doesn’t.  She doesn’t look at history just like 99.9% of the average person.  So pat yourself on the back for being just as smart as Liz Ann Sonders.

Valuations will ALWAYS mark the end and start of secular bear and bull markets.  Always. Remember, the less you pay for something, the better your return will be.  When valuations are low, you are paying less and therefore, your long term return will be higher.  So long term secular bull markets will ONLY begin when valuations are low.  How low?  Well below historical averages, that’s for sure.  And secular bear markets will begin when valuations are high.  How high? Higher than the long term average.

Remember, the average is the average but we are never at the average point.  We are always either overvalued or undervalued.  Never at fair value. (I say never but really what I mean is for a sustainable period of time…) So we talked about the historical average of 16.6 on the 10 year P/E, but how often are we actually there? 

GuruFocus.com says the current 10 year P/E is 25.5, which I won’t argue. Close enough to 27.  But if you look at the data, the average they have is the 16.6 that I mentioned above.  But how often did we actually hit that?  Very rarely! And we were never there for long.  So as you can see, stock valuations are never really at fair value for long enough to matter.  We are either over or under value at all times.  So you have to decide: are you going to be a buyer or seller at any given point?  Now, do I make my investing decisions based on this?  No. You can find good buys at high valuations and bad buys at good valuations.  But if I am buying broad based funds, then this would elicit some caution at the extreme levels.

BTW, interesting enough, look at when stocks were at their highest valuation peaks…1900, 1929, 1966, 2000, and today…what did stocks do after those levels?  See below…

In 1900, the S&amp;P was at the equivalent of 7.5 or so.  At this point, the 10 year P/E was around 22.  For the next 24 years, the S&amp;P fluctuated between 7 and 10 continuously until the late 1920s boom took things to the next peak/bubble.  Coincidence?  If you think so, you’re smarter than me.

In 1929, the S&amp;P 10 year P/E got to 27. The nominal price of the S&amp;P at that time was 25 or so.  So what happened after that?  The S&amp;P dropped down as low as 7 and didn’t recover to its previous high of 25 until 1952! It took 23 years for the market to hit the same level again. Again…coincidence?  Come on…let’s go to the next extreme…

In 1966, the S&amp;P 10 year P/E hit 24 and the S&amp;P’s nominal price was around 100.  So what happened from there? For the next 16 years, the S&amp;P went sideways and stayed at or below that level until 1982…which was the start of the biggest bull market run in history.

Now for the biggest market extreme ever…1999/2000.  The S&amp;P 10 year P/E got as high as 44 and since then, we have seen new highs…all the way up to 2100 as of late, but the S&amp;P also got as low as 666 and based on valuations, the only reason stocks are so high up right now is that they are at high valuation peaks…so this is not meant to show that paying a high premium is ok.  It is not.  We are going to have a bad stock market for the coming 10-12 years.  History has shown it going back to 1871..why would it be different now? It’s not.  It never is.  Yes, stocks can go higher and higher for a long period of time and irrationally, but it eventually stops.  The music stops.  And suddenly the chairs disappears…

Individual Stocks

Anyone who reads this has seen me short Amazon.  Well, I’ve been killed on it.  And guess what…I’m not worried.  Amazon officially is the most expensive stock, valuation based, in the stock market.  Granted, that’s based on P/E and we all know that P/E can fluctuate wildly but either way, it’s overpriced.  When other companies such as Wal-Mart and Target sell for 0.5 or 0.8 times revenue, Amazon is selling for 3 times revenue.  When other companies are selling for 3-5 times book value, Amazon is selling for 28 times book.  There is no valuation metric that shows Amazon is a good deal.  It has more than doubled in stock price this year alone.

No one cares about valuations during bull markets.  Look at private venture tech companies.  We have never had more “unicorns” (private start ups that are valued over $1Billion) ever in our history.  Including 1999/2000, the most overpriced tech market we have ever had!

The scary part, for investors, should be that Square just announced they are going public for 33% LESS than their last round of private valuation! Less! That’s not good.  They raised money at a $6Billion valuation recently but are now going public based on a $4Billion valuation.

Back in 1999/2000, the only positive of the market was that smaller companies didn’t have bad valuations.  The horrible valuations were on the higher end value of companies.  Today, we are seeing it on all levels, but also high end value companies are seeing larger than life valuations.  Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, Adobe, etc…these companies have been around for a while and are still sporting very high valuations! As I write this, some douche from Edward Jones named Aaron is saying that he has Amazon as a strong buy because of robust growth and stronger margins.  Meanwhile, he also says he values Amazon’s retail business at 2.5 times revenue….WTF?!?!

Here is why I am confused.  Amazon has worse margins on their retail portion than Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart sells for 0.5 times earnings but he decides to put 2.5 times margin on there?!?! Why?!?! Why not 3 times? Why not 4? 5? 6? Just saying a number when the average is a lot lower is insane…of the 81 consumer companies on the S&amp;P 500, the average price to sales ratio CURRENTLY in this massively overpriced market is 1.8 times earnings and the average gross margins is 40% and Amazon’s, on their retail side, is 24%.  Wait, so they are 40% lower on margins and they are worth a premium to sales?  Does that even make sense?  yes, it is growing but as it has grown it’s margins have decreased and the majority of their better margins are coming from AWS, it’s cloud computing services which is a commodity.  It will be a price war. Margins will shrink because the costs to operate are pennies. Google and Microsoft are already in it and growing their portions like crazy.

Another example: Tesla.  Tesla is a great company. Their product rocks.  They’re the new hot thing.  But what’s it worth to us?  So typically, car companies sell for the following:

Ford: 0.38 times sales

GM: 0.39 times sales

Honda: 0.48 times sales

Toyota: 0.83 times sales

Daimler: 0.54 times sales

Are we seeing a pattern yet?

Tesla: 7.1 times sales.

WTF?!?!? Why?!?! Yes, they are cool. Yes, their cars are awesome. But they make no money! Yes, they are trying to grow, but something has to give!! Yes, their gross profit margin is much better than Ford and GM, but it’s not THAT much better than Daimler, Honda, and Toyota, who all sport around 22% margin and Tesla has a bit over 24% margin! So what gives?!?! It doesn’t add up at all. But it’s a sexy and fun company and so everyone will pay whatever they can to get it.

What is the Right Price?

When I go back to my high school, the first thing I do is take my iPhone out and say “Who here has this kind of phone and loves it?”  Sure enough, over half the class raises their hand? So I then asks the students “would you pay $1 for this phone?” And of course, they say “of course we would.”  No duh.  Then I ask “Would you pay $1Million for this phone?”  And of course they say “no way.”  Again…duh.

But that’s what it seems is what happens with stocks like Amazon, FaceBook, Tesla, etc….people say the product or company is awesome so pay whatever it takes to own it.  You may say I am wrong about this, but I’m not.  Why is 7.1 times sales ok for Tesla when similar companies are getting 0.8 times sales, at best?  Why is 3 times sales ok for Amazon when similar companies are selling for 0.5 times sales?

This is a prime example of a bubbling market.  There are massive overvaluations across the board and margins are high because of lower interest costs because of the Fed reducing rates so aggressively over the past 6 years and keeping them low.  When corporate debt interest charges are down 80%, of course you earnings on the same revenue will increase but it doesn’t mean you’re a better company because of it.

If you think about investments the same way I thought about the iPhone, you will realize that there is a price for EVERYTHING.  It doesn’t matter what it is. You can buy a pile of dog shit for the right price as long as you can figure out a way to make something on it.  There is always a price for something.  When Long Term Capital Management went under and rocked the financial world in 1997, Warren Buffett made an offer to buy the very assets that took the company down.  So the same assets that took a company down had gone down in price enough that it was attractive enough for Buffett to make an offer on it. That is a prime example of how prices are what dictates the returns.

Recap

It’s hard to see the market go up and read something above. I get it.  I’m not here to argue that the market can’t go up higher because it can.  And it probably will.  Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.  Look at Japan.  Those markets have been irrational for decades.

But at the end of the day, valuations do matter. And anyone who thinks that buying today will yield good results long term has another thing coming.  It may not happen this year, but it will happen eventually.  People have to give up on stocks for stock prices to go to the point where they are a great buy again. Literally they need to be saying “if you want to retire well, do not buy stocks.” Just like in 2009 when the world fell apart and in that same year in real estate.  People have to give up.

Peter Lynch has an anecdote he has told many times.  He talks about how he knows when to buy or sell stocks.  When he goes to a cocktail party and people are telling HIM what to buy, he knows it’s time to sell.  When he goes to the cocktail party and people are feeling bad for him for being a money manager, he knows it’s a good time to buy.  People think you MUST own stocks and that’s when things get crazy.  Prices have to drop and prices only drop when people don’t want something anymore.

There will be a tipping point soon.  Just like it was mortgage backed securities in 2008.  That isn’t what caused markets to crash, it is just what caused markets to care about valuation suddenly.  The tipping point is something we don’t know or see yet, probably.  But when it happens, everyone will blame this one thing and then later say they saw it happening.  So many people now say “it was so obvious that real estate was overpriced back in 2008.”  Oh was it?  Hmm.  It’s ego on my part because I have 3 years of blog posts showing my views on the market and so far I have been “wrong.”

When this market does take a turn, for us to get to the point of starting a real secular bull market, we have to get to an ugly place.  Years and years of bad returns.  People have to give up.  We aren’t anywhere near that now.  Even 2008 and 2009 wasn’t that bad.  I think in the last 12 years, we have have 11 of them be up years.  That’s unreal.  It shows you how short and quick the last drop was. You don’t lose faith in markets when it’s a quick pop and then rebound.  We need a long term drudging.  It will eventually happen…but I just don’t know when."
51,2015-11-05,UngochNaiv,0,The case for Bitcoin,"I posted this on my blog a couple of weeks ago, and since Bitcoin has been getting a lot of press lately I thought r/investing might be interested. Also r/bitcoinmarkets pretty much hated it and told me to post it here instead. 


I won't be going in too deep of the underlying technology behind it, cause, you know..it's boring as shit. Of course the technology part is of great importance, but it's better explained by math/computer geeks - aka smart people. In short, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network containing units (bitcoins) that can be transferred in the system with zero to low costs. These units can themselves incorporate other pieces of data. Every transaction is verified by the computers running the system. The math behind it makes it impossible for any entity to mess with this process of continuous update of the ledger. The ledger being a sort of receipt which contains all previous transactions in the network. To break the system you would need to muster up more than half of the systems combined computer power. Discounting the possibility of quantum computing this would be incredibly expensive and/or impossible. Which is why banks around the world are working with this technology (not Bitcoin but the block-chain tech) to make tradingsystems where traders can buy/sell stocks. But to understand why Bitcoin is a good hedge, we need to understand money and the fragility of our current economy, and why this might lead to a lot of demand for bitcoins.


**Money**

Money is one of man’s greatest inventions. Since we left the barter system and started using mediums of exchange, different types of mediums has been used for trading. Gold, grain, salt amongst others, gold obviously being the most famous one. The right to redeem those papers you hold in your wallet for gold ended in a peculiar fashion with the death of Bretton Woods, and ever since then, we've been trading in fiat.(1). Like art, the intrinsic value of gold is definitely questionable. Yes, everyone does seem to desire gold, still it has very limited usefulness. Paper money being a lot worse, one could argue these unredeemable paper notes are worth as much as regular paper. But the fact that you need this fiat-money to pay taxes gives the market certainty of demand in the future, which I believe is the main reason why the markets are able to attribute these notes value.


**Governmental control of money**

As fiat became the predominant transmitter of wealth in our economy, governmental control over money increased. From a naive standpoint that power shift could seem unsignificant, but I would argue it has given us a profound shift in real economic activities. Money in the form of gold had a certain inflation built in to it, since people continuously dig it up from the ground. Yet the gold-economy saw price deflation as production became more efficient, thanks to the invisible hand of the market and advancements in technology. These deflationary powers were at times greater than the inflation coming from new gold findings. This might seem a little off topic but what I want to say is that price-deflation has historically been the norm, and shouldn't be viewed as dangerous. In todays fiat-world however, we hear about central banks trying to fight deflation, believing such an environment would be bad for the labour market. The main argument being that workers have a hard time accepting lower nominal wages, and that this causes overwhelming troubles for companies when they have to cut labour costs. Although fairly logical, I think this theory is disputed by our economic history and should in my opinion definitely not be taken as a fact. However, today when we hear about central banks fighting deflation, what they're really fighting is a credit crunch. Debt, also a form of money, has been growing increasingly for quite some time, driven of course by both fiscal and monetary policy actions. A deleveraging of debt would shrink the amount of debt-money, largely concentrated in stocks/bonds/real estate. This is what central banks are fighting, their job is basically to get this overly leveraged economy, more leveraged. Needless to say, we're in uncharted territory and their might be huge systemic risks involved. Bitcoin may be one way to hedge against this.


**Government deficits and unfunded liabilities**

At which rate would you be willing to loan money to Greece? This one is really a no-brainier, meaning you shouldn't have to think to come up with an answer, since Greece wouldn't pay you back either way. Greece has a enormous debt and a whole lot of unfunded liabilities. These unfunded liabilities are mostly consisting of workers pensions and healthcare obligations to the greek people. Greek politicians will always rank these payment obligations as a higher priority expenditure than to give ""greedy speculators"" back their money. That simple fact holds true for most government bonds. Therefore I think almost all government bonds are worth substantially less than they are being priced today.  Right now the market deems these bonds as low-risk assets. For example, the U.S 10-year bond yields around 2%. In other words; you'll get close to no return (if the FED manages to reach close to its inflation target) for loaning out your money to the worlds largest debtor nation for a period of ten years. This anomaly is so great and profound, it should be viewed as a major indicator on just how messed up things have become. How did we get these absurd yields? Well, demand for bonds drive the yields down, and ever since the financial crisis central banks like the FED and ECB has been on a buying spree. Speculators joined them in their buying and have been betting on the the continuing bondpurchasing from the CB's, or holding a belief that the CB's will be unable to reach inflation targets, basically taking a bet on deflation. In a real market economy (not driven by central banks) with a low savings rate like the United States, these bonds would yield a lot more. The fact is the U.S, much like Greece, can’t repay its debt, ever, it’s impossible, nope, can’t be done. The U.S national debt is around 18 trillion dollars and their unfunded liabilities sums up to another whopping 210 trillion (as testified to congress by Boston university economic professor Laurence Kotlikoff).(2) Even though a lot of these future expenditures as Kotlikoff is including in his measurment could be slashed, some of them, like pensions, are going to be extremely unpopular to cut. If you listen to austrian economists they are pretty much all agreeing, proclaiming that the writing has been on the wall for quite some time.


**Fear of haircuts**

If this whole experiment with low interest rates fails, and economic chaos indeed ensues, I expect governments around the world to act in a similar fashion as seen in Greece/Argentine. Bank depositors will most likely have to take a haircut on their deposits to refinance the banking system. I believe the threat of this bail-in approach to reach debt-equilibrium in the financial world, will drive people to assets which cannot be confiscated. And if you don't think bail-in is a high probabilty event in your country, here's Reuters reporting on the new bail-in legislation: ""Bail-in legislation is now being extended to other EU countries, regardless of whether they're in the Euro or not.""(3).We’ve already seen some correlations of the Bitcoin price with bad economic sentiment, and I expect that trend to catch on as time proceeds. The most clear cut example of this we got during the summer, with the increase in demand for bitcoins during the Greek-crisis. The day Greece reached an agreement with its creditors- Bitcoin dropped 12%. Yet, recent volatility in global stocks has not been accompanied with upward pressure on Bitcoin. When Dow Jones fell a thousand points intraday, Bitcoin fell as well. Suggestion the link between financial instability and the value of bitcoins at least for now is rather weak. But take a look at Argentine and their post collapse economy and you'll find something very interesting. After suffering a bond market collapse and soaring inflation, it is here where bitcoin is having the most impact as an actual money transmitter. As NYT notes ”Argentine has been quietly gaining renown in technology circles as the first, and almost only place where bitcoins are being regularly used by ordinary people for real commercial transactions.”(4)


**Valuation and risk**

First of all, one should obviously not invest more than what's bearable to lose, since there's a nontrivial chance of bitcoin having the value of zero in the future. I also don't want to be responsible for anyone losing a big piece of their net worth, but if you invest your money according what someone on the internet with the name ""UngNaiv"" (young and foolish) you probably have no one to blame but yourself. Anyway, today Bitcoin have a market cap of about 4.5 billion dollars. Besides a small market cap, the uncertainty of demand and the arguably lack of intrinsic value is two of its biggest weaknesses. Even if you believe in the idea of a digital currency, Bitcoin is far from the only one out there. There's competition in the form of other cryptocurrencies with similar but different properties, and only the future will tell which of these (if any) will come out on top. As for now though, Bitcoin has established itself as the clear frontrunner. There is also a high governmental risk involved. If our political leaders start seeing this digital money as a threat to its powers of taxation, or fears grow about what it might do to enable shady transactions, it will certainly go out of its way to try and stop it. Even though the Bitcoin as a system itself is resiliencent to government intervention, one could easily foresee regulation aimed to strangle Bitcoin companies operating in the real world, making mass adoption a lot less likely. So far the western world haven’t cracked down too much on Bitcoin, in some places it has even been declared as a currency, not a commodity, meaning any potential gains in one's holding in those countries would be free from taxation. I'll leave the risks of the underlying technology to be explained by someone else, but google the words Bitcoin+fork and you'll find another very good reason not to go full retard in bitcoins.
