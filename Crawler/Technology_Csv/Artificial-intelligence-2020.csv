1,2020-01-25,Anaranovski,1,Motley Fool - David's Best Buy Now,"Summary from the post to avoid copyright issues.  I can say that, as of this writing, except for AMZN, they have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 for the 1- and 5-year period.  AMZN outperformed for 5-year but underperformed for 1-year period

YMMV

&gt; **Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)** is one of the best companies in the world, one we've recommended multiple times in Stock Advisor. And it's still one of our top investing opportunities today, because it's keeping up a fast pace of innovation. Consider ongoing successes like Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud service — AWS has captured roughly half of the cloud infrastructure market, and it's still Amazon's fastest-growing segment.
 
&gt; It's been almost a year since we last named **Idexx Laboratories (NASDAQ: IDXX)** a Best Buy Now. Back then, I wrote that it had more than tripled for members who bought shares when we recommended it in July 2014. Well, Idexx has spent the last 11 months going even higher — it's now up 330% since that initial recommendation, better than a 4-bagger.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been more than two years since **McCormick (NYSE: MKC)** last appeared as a Best Buy Now in Stock Advisor. Over that period, its stock is up roughly 70% versus the market's nearly 30% — and that's just in stock gains alone. This dividend aristocrat's total returns outperform the market by a whopping 44 percentage points over that same time period.
&gt; 
&gt; In November 2018, **NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)** fell from grace, never to recover — or so the talking heads would have told you. Back then, the company was dealing with the fallout of an unexpected drop in demand for its cryptocurrency mining products. Nowadays, the chipmaker's world couldn't look brighter. Its graphics, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence chips are key to advances in gaming, cloud computing, automotive connectivity, manufacturing, and healthcare.
&gt; 
&gt; There's an unquenchable thirst for data around the world, which is triggering an intense, high-stakes race in the semiconductor industry. That's great news for **Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS)**, a kind of behind-the-scenes quality assurance specialist that can benefit no matter which chipmakers have the upper hand."
2,2020-01-02,financeoptimum,1,Venture Capital and Accredited Investors,"We can look at many companies that went public and made VCs A LOT.

A VC firm raises 'funds' from investors (called LPs).

Obviously, the return on some of these IPOs not only 'makes the fund' but can 'make the firm'.

Not only does the VC firm make a 20% performance fee on the upside, but they also collect **management fees** every year.

The reputation that this one deal can give them makes it far easier to raise more capital for future funds, therefore resulting in **more management fees**.

For a $1BN fund, that is $20MM every year, which is split between the General Partners (GPs) of the VC fund.

Of course, if one of the portfolio companies is a Unicorn, then they get some (20%) of the upside as well.

The tech boom in Silicon Valley has of course created a lot of value in society, with products being used by hundreds of millions if not billions of people. The entrepreneurs who take this risk and retain equity become, in many cases, billionaires and this is only fair - as they are providing value at scale (and have to take some form of risk to achieve it). This also creates huge amounts of wealth for these investors, **WHO ARE ALL ACCREDITED INVESTORS**.

To me, that is not meritocratic.

Anyone over the age of 18 surely should have the ability to invest their capital into startups.

After all, people are able to put themselves into $10Ks of college debt at that age and, in many areas of the world, are able to gamble without restriction.

Yet they are not able to participate in the early rounds of companies such as Facebook, Uber, etc.

Now any wave of technological innovation often leads to wealth inequality.

These waves of innovation create vast amounts of wealth, and this is not unique to Silicon Valley.

It has happened throughout modern history.

The first great wave was steam power, which eventually led to the creation of the locomotive. Steam power fed the Industrial Revolution, which created fabulous wealth.

In the early 1800s, much of this excess wealth generated by steam power and the Industrial Revolution went into locomotive stocks on the London Stock Exchange, forming a bubble - which popped in 1850. The heyday of the railroad would be the 1880s and 1890s; so the Crash of 1850 was due to speculation and the wealth created by science, but the real job of railing the world would take many more decades. So despite the bubble bursting, America was left with an infrastructure of railroads that made intercontinental travel and shipping dramatically easier and cheaper.

The second great wave was led by the electric and automotive revolutions of Edison and Ford. The electrification of the factory and household, as well as the proliferation of the Model T again created fabulous wealth. But this excess wealth had to go somewhere. In this case, it went into the U.S. Stock Exchange, in the form of a bubble in utility and automotive stocks.

People ignored the lesson of the Crash of 1850, as that was a full eighty years in the past.

From 1900 to 1925, the number of automobile start-up companies hit 3000, which the market simply could not support.

This bubble was unsustainable and for this, and other reasons, the bubble popped in 1929 creating the Great Depression.

The main paving and electrification of the United States and Europe would not fully take place until after the crash, during the 1950s and 1960s.

The third great wave was the coming of high tech - in the form of computers, lasers, space satellites, the Internet and electronics. Again, the fabulous wealth had to go somewhere. In this case, it mostly went to real estate - creating a huge bubble.

People of all incomes were over-leveraged...

Greedy bankers fuelled this bubble by giving away mortgages like water, and the Fed also played a role.

Once again, people forgot history and the lessons of the crashes of 1850 and 1929, and we had the 2008 Great Recession.

This leads us to the following question: what is the fourth wave?

Of course, no one knows for sure what is going to happen in the future (if they did they would just be betting on sports 24/7 without restriction, as long as they're over 18...)

But it seems reasonable to assume that fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, nanotechnology, telecommunications, and biotechnology will play a significant role.

Again, fabulous wealth will be created but hopefully in 2090 people will not ignore the lessons of the past and hopefully a **greater proportion of the population have the ability to invest and benefit from this wealth creation**.

7,2020-02-01,marketforecast1,1,Experiment: Investing in Future Technologies,"**Experiment: Investing in Future Technologies** 

I like to earn money on investments, and I also love modern technology.

I decided to conduct an experiment: make a list of potential technologies of the future and invest part of my capital in them. There are 14 industries on this list. Keeping track of this number and trying to guess in each one or more potential leaders is quite difficult.

As a result, I decided it was safer to contact not with specific companies, but with ETFs – funds that invest immediately in the industry or some set of companies. As a result, I opened an account with Interactive Brokers and started choosing funds.

&gt;***What kind of ETF and Interactive Brokers, let me just invest in the creation of robocopes***  
*We already wrote about what ETFs are and how they work – if you are in the know, you can skip this paragraph. In short: An ETF is a fund that includes a specific set of securities. When you buy an ETF stock, you invest immediately in all the companies in its portfolio. This is convenient because the threshold for entering the ETF is much lower than if you had to buy shares of each company in this fund. For convenience, you have to pay a commission that covers the costs of the fund.*  
*And Interactive Brokers is an American broker who opens accounts with clients from different countries. Such an account is one of the ways to buy stocks and ETFs on the American stock exchange.*

## How did I choose funds and how much did I invest

I must say right away that in each industry, I eventually allocated one ETF and invested $ 1000 in it. A total of 14 funds and $ 14,000.

When choosing a fund, I was guided by the following criteria:

1. Specialization of the fund on a specific technology, and not on a wide range.
2. Methodology for the selection of issuers.
3. Liquidity.
4. Adequate spread with which you can buy paper.
5. The size of the service fee.
6. Launch date.
7. The presence of competitors.
8. Historical quotes.

In each section, I give illustrations of quotes and geography – from them you can understand the historical profitability of the fund, the effectiveness of the stock selection methodology and how well the fund is diversified: ideally, it should track companies around the world, and not just in the United States.

Many eggs, many baskets. How exchange funds work  
At the end of the article will be an interactive table with all selected funds. It shows what is happening now with my portfolio.

## Fund 1 – Drones

Goldman Sachs predicts that [by 2020, the cost of drones in the world will exceed $ 100 billion](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/technology-driving-innovation/drones/). Drones are used everywhere:

1. Military – for reconnaissance and military operations.
2. Consumers are photographers, videographers and just lovers of toys.
3. Law enforcement agencies – for surveillance and patrolling.
4. E-Commerce – Amazon Already Delivers Drones Purchases in the UK
5. Oil and gas sector – for monitoring pipelines.
6. Construction – for maintenance, surveying, mapping.
7. Government agencies for rescue missions.
8. Agriculture – for soil analysis, crop health assessment, pesticide spraying, seed planting and field irrigation throughout the crop cycle.

Now in the drone industry you can invest with only one narrow-profile fund – ETFMG Drone Economy Strategy, [ticker IFLY](https://www.etf.com/IFLY). The fund tracks its own stock index of companies around the world – US companies account for only 58.67% of the portfolio. All index companies are associated with the unmanned aerial vehicle industry, including manufacturers and suppliers. IFLY launched in March 2016, the fund takes a commission of 0.75% for the management.

## Fund 2 – Artificial Intelligence

This sector includes developments in machine learning, neural networks, robotics, face and speech recognition. Thanks to neural networks, the on-board computer of self-driving vehicles can distinguish a pedestrian from other objects on the highway.

9,2020-03-16,tttmmmsss,1,Crisis Means a New Business Era | WSJ Op-ed,"&gt;**Crisis Means a New Business Era**

&gt;*Cheap energy, a shift from China and remote work will all shape the long-term economy.*


&gt;The junk-bond-financed $6.75 billion buyout of United Airlines collapsed on Friday, Oct. 13, 1989. The stock market immediately dropped 191 points or almost 7%, equivalent to a 1,500-point drop today. Scary.

&gt;Rod Berens, head of research at Morgan Stanley at the time, called a departmentwide meeting after the market closed. I dreaded going. I had a list of tech stocks I was recommending that got killed that day. When I showed up, I noticed several cases of champagne—a weird way to celebrate the loss of wealth. But why not? I grabbed a glass; it was Friday.

&gt;And then my boss headed toward me. Uh oh, I thought, he’s going to fire me. Instead, he smiled, gave me a high-five and said, “Congratulations, now it’s your turn,” and clinked my glass. Talk about confused—one of the worst days in my professional life and I get congratulated?

&gt;I didn’t see it at the time, but he was dead right. Eras change, sometimes overnight. Over the next decade, the stock market shifted from junk-bond-fueled buyouts, a dominant Japan and the Cold War to highly valued emerging technology companies, ending with the dot-com blowout.

&gt;The current market turmoil tells me a new era is breaking, so question everything. Will cable, energy, mobile and social media ever come back? And if not, what’s next?

&gt;Well, the knee-jerk reactions will come first. Most think the 2003 SARS epidemic in China ushered in that country’s era of e-commerce, but it was going to happen anyway—the crisis only accelerated it. So be wary about talk of robot and drone deliveries. It may come to that if the virus spreads, but the economics still seem far out.

&gt;Will energy stay cheap forever after this week’s devastation? I doubt it, but the economy can finally benefit from fracking’s cheap natural gas. I’d bet so-called clean and renewable energy was set back a decade by having to compete with lower prices. Cheap fossil fuels may also push back any new adoption of carbon-free nuclear energy.

&gt;More interesting is the emptying of countless college campuses, sending students home. Classes will be online-only until further notice. Smart. But at some point parents will surely ask, “Why again are we paying 78 grand a year?” Is the end of universities far behind?

&gt;Similarly, lots of companies are telling employees to work at home. Will an era of telecommuting and no rush-hour traffic finally arrive? Maybe not. Recall that early in Marissa Mayer’s tenure as Yahoo CEO, she banned working from home because so many people were, as they say, mailing it in.

&gt;The end of China’s dominance is certainly coming. No one will ever again concentrate manufacturing in China alone. Vietnam and other countries with low-cost labor will benefit. Maybe this is Africa’s moment. Related: A louder globalization backlash may arise again—but since consumers like cheap goods, it will flame out.

&gt;Another observation: Interest rates and the Federal Reserve may be increasingly irrelevant. The Fed’s job seems to be to ensure the availability of Treasurys—mostly, as we wrote last September, as collateral for the repo market, which finances an increasing share of global trade. The $500 billion announced Thursday is encouraging.

&gt;What about mobile and cloud computing, and even the stock market and its trillion-dollar valuations? It’s worth asking, as venture capital and private equity using cheap debt are keeping companies private longer, or forever. Others think it is value stocks’ turn to shine, but that usually requires a period of inflation that I certainly don’t see coming. Quite the opposite.

&gt;No, growth will still rule, but with a different set of leaders. In the bio world, DNA sequencing and Crispr gene editing are starting to ramp up. Health care will be transformed by new ways to detect and treat cancer and other ways to cure previously incurable diseases like sickle-cell anemia.

&gt;In the high-tech world, mobile seems tired. Apple’s hottest product is AirPods Pro, those Star Wars-inspired white sticks hanging out of everyone’s ears. That’s an accessory, not an innovation. Here’s hoping for some knock-your-socks-off new mobile products. Note also that we’re only about a third of the way into the cloudification of enterprises. And we’re only beginning to master machine learning and artificial intelligence, with their ability to find patterns that humans can’t. I think the next tech era will be driven by implementation of AI-infused systems into every business.

&gt;Finally, I asked the man himself, Rod Berens, whom he’d high-five today. He says that the past 30 year’s tech abundance means the developing world’s billions will finally see productivity improvements and attract an increasing share of investment. That’s probably right.

&gt;New eras are notoriously hard to predict. So instead of focusing on which cities are quarantined, start thinking about what’s next. Very few investors do."

The order is for a total of 1,200 logistical vehicles and fulfilled by China-based EV manufacturer [Jiangsu AOXIN New Energy Automobile](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2680758-1&amp;h=12719485&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aoxinauto.com%2Feng%2Fabout1.asp%3Fid%3D1&amp;a=Jiangsu+AOXIN%C2%A0New+Energy+Automobile) Co., Ltd. through their X30L model, with the first 500 ordered in Q4, and the remaining 700 being ordered for Q1, 2020, for a total possible order value of 167 Million RMB, or approximately $24 Million.

The initial order signed during Q4 is for 500 vehicles, with the remaining order for 700 vehicles in Q1 2020. The vehicles are city/urban delivery cargo vans intended to facilitate last-mile deliveries. MEG will derive fees from this transaction through arranging the procurement and financing, although the company has not yet completed the accounting analysis to determine whether this revenue should be recorded on a Gross or Net basis under US GAAP – meaning the revenues may reflect net fees earned and not the $24MM order value.

""We are thrilled to get our first EV logistical vehicle orders underway, as this represents our largest potential segment of MEG in terms of vehicle order numbers and is the second of our four operating segments to successfully source large-scale EV vehicle orders,"" said Alf Poor, CEO of Ideanomics. ""This helps us confidently plan for 2020, knowing that each of our four segments is going to be active and, along with our bus and heavy truck segments, are already sourcing deal flow. With our taxi activities in Chengdu and Guilin held over until Q1, due to municipal subsidies and new taxi license policies being put in place for 2020, we were able to bring this deal together quickly and efficiently, prior to our lease financing funding channels coming online. This, together with our Taxi activities in Chengdu, Guilin, and Yunnan province in Q1, will provide us with a platform that will ramp up in Q2 and beyond as our business begins to hit its stride.""

The logistical vehicle market in China is estimated at 14 million vehicles, making it a considerable growth market for the EV industry.

17,2020-05-04,SafetyDictator,1,Rate these 2 Portfolios: Actively managed vs Passively managed,"Hello all, I would appreciate any of your inputs. I've done quite a bit of research and arrived at these portfolios for long term dividend growth + yield.  I have a pretty long investment time horizon so there's essentially no bonds, and I live in Canada, which is why my portfolio is Canadian focused.

Due to recent events and quantitative easing by the Fed, I am worried about the stock market trading sideways for a long time similar to the Nikkei 225 in Japan. Therefore, I believe a dividend/yield focused portfolio provides a steady source of growth in the absence of capital appreciation.

One of these portfolios seeks higher yield using actively managed strategies (such as artificial intelligence via HAL.TO), while the other portfolio seeks to minimize MER. I will list them below and briefly explain my rationale:

# Portfolio 1 (Actively Managed):

* CI First Asset Canadian REIT ETF (RIT.TO) - 40% allocation
* Horizons Canadian Active Dividend ETF (HAL.TO) - 30% allocation
* BMO Global High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.717%

**Rationale:** 

I know the management fee is high, but if you check the annualized performance since inception of RIT.TO and HAL.TO, they are 9.20% and 7.27%. I know passive management generally beats active management, but in this case it might be different. Real estate is generally a sector where active management can provide more value than in stocks, due to more inefficiencies to exploit. HAL.TO uses artificial intelligence and big data to predict dividend yield and sustainability, which seemed to have provided superior returns so far. 

Plus, the real estate market might be in big trouble, so the active management of RIT.TO might be useful to implement proactive/defensive plays. It's also interesting HAL.TO positioned it's allocation to utilities as its top sector allocation, since utilities tend to perform the best during a market downturn.

In terms of BMO covered call ETF, I see it as a pseudo-bond that provides good yield even in economic downturns. I chose ZWG.TO because it is geographically diversified compared to the other BMO covered call ETFs. I've heard good things about ZWH.TO (USA only), because the covered call premiums are higher in the US (though ZWG.TO is almost 60% US). 

# Portfolio 2 (Passively Managed):

* Vanguard FTSE Canadian Capped REIT Index ETF (VRE.TO) - 40% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDIV.TO) - 30% allocation
* iShares Core MSCI Global Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDG.TO) - 30% allocation

Total MER: 0.258%

**Rationale:**

These are the lowest fee ETFs I could find compared to similar competition. I personally really like REITs which is why I am so heavy in real estate, and VRE.TO is the cheapest compared to other REIT etfs like XRE.TO and ZRE.TO. I also like the MSCI High Dividend Yield Indices that XDIV.TO and XDG.TO tracks, which uses smart beta methods (Tangerine's high dividend mutual fund also tracks this index). 

&amp;#x200B;

Moovit’s free mobile navigation app provides transit information to more than 750 million users in 100 countries.

Last month it launched an emergency mobilization service, which was created for transit agencies and enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic. The technology transforms vehicle fleets into an on-demand service to get essential employees safely to work and has been implemented in a number of cities by large corporations.

Intel has made significant investments already in Israel, having acquired autonomous vehicle technology provider Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017. In December it bought Israeli artificial intelligence firm Habana Labs for $2 billion."
20,2020-05-01,CD_Johanna,1,Thoughts on making a long term play on IBM with its new CEO?,"While many people are talking about Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in the cloud computing war, I think IBM could be the dark horse in the race.

Ginni Rometty ran the company into the ground, but I think Arvind Krishna could be the next Nadella.

He has a PhD in engineering and was the senior VP of cloud and cognitive software. He seems committed to artificial intelligence, cloud, quantum computing, and blockchain technology.

IBM has a strong balance sheet, moat, and dividend, it isn't going anywhere, and a P/E of 10.38.

My thought is that in 10 years, IBM can be a major again with its commitment to technology of the future. 

Anything I should consider before I start investing in it?"
