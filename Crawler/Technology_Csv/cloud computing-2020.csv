0,2020-01-25,Anaranovski,1,Motley Fool - David's Best Buy Now,"Summary from the post to avoid copyright issues.  I can say that, as of this writing, except for AMZN, they have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 for the 1- and 5-year period.  AMZN outperformed for 5-year but underperformed for 1-year period

YMMV

&gt; **Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)** is one of the best companies in the world, one we've recommended multiple times in Stock Advisor. And it's still one of our top investing opportunities today, because it's keeping up a fast pace of innovation. Consider ongoing successes like Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud service — AWS has captured roughly half of the cloud infrastructure market, and it's still Amazon's fastest-growing segment.
 
&gt; It's been almost a year since we last named **Idexx Laboratories (NASDAQ: IDXX)** a Best Buy Now. Back then, I wrote that it had more than tripled for members who bought shares when we recommended it in July 2014. Well, Idexx has spent the last 11 months going even higher — it's now up 330% since that initial recommendation, better than a 4-bagger.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been more than two years since **McCormick (NYSE: MKC)** last appeared as a Best Buy Now in Stock Advisor. Over that period, its stock is up roughly 70% versus the market's nearly 30% — and that's just in stock gains alone. This dividend aristocrat's total returns outperform the market by a whopping 44 percentage points over that same time period.
&gt; 
&gt; In November 2018, **NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)** fell from grace, never to recover — or so the talking heads would have told you. Back then, the company was dealing with the fallout of an unexpected drop in demand for its cryptocurrency mining products. Nowadays, the chipmaker's world couldn't look brighter. Its graphics, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence chips are key to advances in gaming, cloud computing, automotive connectivity, manufacturing, and healthcare.
&gt; 
&gt; There's an unquenchable thirst for data around the world, which is triggering an intense, high-stakes race in the semiconductor industry. That's great news for **Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS)**, a kind of behind-the-scenes quality assurance specialist that can benefit no matter which chipmakers have the upper hand."
1,2020-01-06,A-Pak-Of-Brownguys,1,Buy $AMD for growth/income?,"After obtaining my undergrad in Finance about 2 years ago. I long forgot my school ID and password that left me out the databases. I recently lucked out and remembered it outta the blue. I’ve been doing a lot of company research on my holdings ever since. 

The money I used from my graduation party was all invested in AMD. Only did this because of what I learned about the hardware/cloud computing industry during my senior project/internship (Help an upstart cloud analytics company). Just found out that they’re investing in the micro machine/nano tech industry. Assuming the progress we’ve seen with tech, I do think this is the future. My question is will this pay off for AMD? What do you all think? 

I have a few grand that I want to invest in AMD. My portfolio is build on growth and income that’s set for retirement. 

On another note, I took for granted these databases in my undergrad lol."

4,2020-02-18,artofgio,1,Coronavirus Will Reward the Wolves and Punish the Sheep,"TLDR: Panic selling is what stupid people do and it can be one of the costliest decisions an investor will ever make. Your short term capital gains will never, ever make up for the lost potential gains you'll suffer. 

I have a fairly forward-looking portfolio: The big boiz (T-MAGA), some other tech and AI, some midstream and renewables, some entertainment and streaming; and others, freckled with some biotech, dividend champion/aristocrat cushioning, and safe, old favorites (The Warren Buffett picks, mostly), and one thing I'm seeing is that stocks that are super strong are getting shaky (some of them are getting hammered) due to what I believe is panic-selling.

Most successful investors (those that have not lost money) know that panic-selling is the Morgoth of money already, so if at least 80% of your portfolio is long term (as in hold or buy for at least 3 years) then you don't even need to read what I'm about to write because it's old news to you.

Anyway, here's some fun, but very true facts:

* Coronavirus (COVID-19)
   * has killed \~2000 people (according to USA Today)
   * is new and interesting (dangerous)
   * will likely be under control before summer.
* Orthomyxovirus (THE FUCKING ***FLU***)
   * between 12,000 – 61,000 **deaths** annually since 2010 ([https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html))
   * is constantly mutating its hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes (remember H1N1? that's what those letters are. )
* The US economy
   * is stronger than it's EVER BEEN.
      * you heard God-Emperor Trumpiboi. 
      * is growing and isn't showing any signs of stopping.

That said, I'm seeing companies like T-MAGA weathering the storm as expected, at least for now. Apple opened low so I increased my position and - wouldn't you know - it went back up 3 bucks. Google is teetering but it's fucking google so it's not going anywhere. You get the picture: winners don't just magically start losing. They can, however, appear like they have magically started losing when people who run for cover every time some blowhard reporter blows a situation out of proportion start panic-selling. 

So what? Who cares, right? Buy low, sell high, am I right? Well, in case anyone has been under a rock for the last couple of months, short-sellers (you know who you are) have been getting their shit packed in more violently than ever before. Why might this be? Oh yeah, because the economy is stronger than it's ever been. It's somehow super easy for people to forget that when a virus that only knocks off the very young, very elderly, and the otherwise immunocompromised takes out a near-invisibly small fraction of the population. This causes them to fear for the worst, especially after seeing such unbelievable returns, and they start having visions of their portfolio drenched in red. So they figure ""fuck it I made my money, time to get out before the world ends."" 

To be clear, I am absolutely saying that you should never, ever sell a stock. There are certainly times in the history of the economy where it's been wise to sell. A popular example nowadays is sears vs amazon. But selling positions in strong, promising companies just because ""OMG GUYS LOOK AT ALL THE RED OMGOMG CORONAVIRUS MUST BE KILLING MILLIONS"" is just dumb. These people are the sheep I'm talking about.

Again, why do I care?

I care because it took me a very (very) long time to shake that mentality and come to a point where I only sold a stock under at least one of two conditions:

* It's huper high (or just overvalued) and none of my best resources have given me any reason to believe it's getting higher
* There's another stock that's super undervalued and I have very good reasons to believe it will grow.

But, before I grew up, I lost so much money in panic/short-selling that I'm embarrassed to say how much. To give you an idea, however, I will say that at one point I owned a large amount of microsoft at a cost basis of \~30 bucks a share that I sold at 32 because I didn't really like PC's and all the people who told me AI, cloud computing, and deep learning were the ""way of the future"" were, to me, the same dumbfucks I made fun of for buying Ferrari IPO. If I had listened to those whose experience far exceeded my own and just held my investments, I'd have 6-bagged it with msft, not including the dividend. I also owned Tesla at 147 and Apple at 115 but I wont say how much because it just hurts too badly. 

So now, even though it is still very hard to see my gains seemingly dissolve before my eyes, I know that if I give in to the panic someone patient and smart enough to wait will buy up the shares at a discount. Nope. Fuck that. I won't let fear cost me another dime, and neither should anyone reading this. 

Every investor i've ever talked to has admitted to panic selling in the past. What separates good investors from great investors is when they learn to stop. Even Buffett has made some bad calls. Bad investors, however, never stop giving in to their impulses. I wasn't quick to the lesson, to be sure. I have been investing for 14 years. I have a bachelor's degree in fine art, a bachelor's degree in biology with a minor in chemistry, a master's degree in biomedical science, and am currently halfway through a doctorate. That's 11 years of ""higher education"" SO FAR, and it still wasn't enough to get me smart enough to just take advice from rich people. After all, that's what I want to be: rich.

So, when the market likely tanks this week, just remember there are some people that, had they taken this advice years ago, could be living debt and mortgage free with a multi-million dollar portfolio to retire them by age 40. Hint. Fucking. Hint.

**Bottom line:** **Panic selling has cost me roughly 6x more money in lost potential gains than any other expense in my life, yes, even more than all the college. So just chew on that for a second. When your eyes widen and you go ""oh,** ***fuck*****..."" just imagine how stupid I feel.**"

6,2020-03-16,tttmmmsss,1,Crisis Means a New Business Era | WSJ Op-ed,"&gt;**Crisis Means a New Business Era**

&gt;*Cheap energy, a shift from China and remote work will all shape the long-term economy.*


&gt;The junk-bond-financed $6.75 billion buyout of United Airlines collapsed on Friday, Oct. 13, 1989. The stock market immediately dropped 191 points or almost 7%, equivalent to a 1,500-point drop today. Scary.

&gt;Rod Berens, head of research at Morgan Stanley at the time, called a departmentwide meeting after the market closed. I dreaded going. I had a list of tech stocks I was recommending that got killed that day. When I showed up, I noticed several cases of champagne—a weird way to celebrate the loss of wealth. But why not? I grabbed a glass; it was Friday.

&gt;And then my boss headed toward me. Uh oh, I thought, he’s going to fire me. Instead, he smiled, gave me a high-five and said, “Congratulations, now it’s your turn,” and clinked my glass. Talk about confused—one of the worst days in my professional life and I get congratulated?

&gt;I didn’t see it at the time, but he was dead right. Eras change, sometimes overnight. Over the next decade, the stock market shifted from junk-bond-fueled buyouts, a dominant Japan and the Cold War to highly valued emerging technology companies, ending with the dot-com blowout.

&gt;The current market turmoil tells me a new era is breaking, so question everything. Will cable, energy, mobile and social media ever come back? And if not, what’s next?

&gt;Well, the knee-jerk reactions will come first. Most think the 2003 SARS epidemic in China ushered in that country’s era of e-commerce, but it was going to happen anyway—the crisis only accelerated it. So be wary about talk of robot and drone deliveries. It may come to that if the virus spreads, but the economics still seem far out.

&gt;Will energy stay cheap forever after this week’s devastation? I doubt it, but the economy can finally benefit from fracking’s cheap natural gas. I’d bet so-called clean and renewable energy was set back a decade by having to compete with lower prices. Cheap fossil fuels may also push back any new adoption of carbon-free nuclear energy.

&gt;More interesting is the emptying of countless college campuses, sending students home. Classes will be online-only until further notice. Smart. But at some point parents will surely ask, “Why again are we paying 78 grand a year?” Is the end of universities far behind?

&gt;Similarly, lots of companies are telling employees to work at home. Will an era of telecommuting and no rush-hour traffic finally arrive? Maybe not. Recall that early in Marissa Mayer’s tenure as Yahoo CEO, she banned working from home because so many people were, as they say, mailing it in.

&gt;The end of China’s dominance is certainly coming. No one will ever again concentrate manufacturing in China alone. Vietnam and other countries with low-cost labor will benefit. Maybe this is Africa’s moment. Related: A louder globalization backlash may arise again—but since consumers like cheap goods, it will flame out.

&gt;Another observation: Interest rates and the Federal Reserve may be increasingly irrelevant. The Fed’s job seems to be to ensure the availability of Treasurys—mostly, as we wrote last September, as collateral for the repo market, which finances an increasing share of global trade. The $500 billion announced Thursday is encouraging.

&gt;What about mobile and cloud computing, and even the stock market and its trillion-dollar valuations? It’s worth asking, as venture capital and private equity using cheap debt are keeping companies private longer, or forever. Others think it is value stocks’ turn to shine, but that usually requires a period of inflation that I certainly don’t see coming. Quite the opposite.

&gt;No, growth will still rule, but with a different set of leaders. In the bio world, DNA sequencing and Crispr gene editing are starting to ramp up. Health care will be transformed by new ways to detect and treat cancer and other ways to cure previously incurable diseases like sickle-cell anemia.

&gt;In the high-tech world, mobile seems tired. Apple’s hottest product is AirPods Pro, those Star Wars-inspired white sticks hanging out of everyone’s ears. That’s an accessory, not an innovation. Here’s hoping for some knock-your-socks-off new mobile products. Note also that we’re only about a third of the way into the cloudification of enterprises. And we’re only beginning to master machine learning and artificial intelligence, with their ability to find patterns that humans can’t. I think the next tech era will be driven by implementation of AI-infused systems into every business.

&gt;Finally, I asked the man himself, Rod Berens, whom he’d high-five today. He says that the past 30 year’s tech abundance means the developing world’s billions will finally see productivity improvements and attract an increasing share of investment. That’s probably right.

&gt;New eras are notoriously hard to predict. So instead of focusing on which cities are quarantined, start thinking about what’s next. Very few investors do."
7,2020-03-13,Wild_Space,1,Quick Takes on Major Stocks," 

Legacy Positions:

AAPL - Slow growth cyclical business that goes on sale during off product cycle years. Huge net cash hoard has historically made this stock cheaper than it screens, but still trading at higher multiples than its growth can justify.

DIS - Slow growth business with major headwinds not fully priced in. ESPN —not counting ESPN2, etc— demanded $8 a month in revenue from a peak base of \~100m cable subs. ESPN+ cannot hope to compensate. Domestic parks see double-barreled growth every year, international are more mixed. Cinema is likely a golden era and a source of decline rather than growth. Shit ton of debt due to ill-advised FOX acquisition makes this company more expensive than it screens. 

BRK - A terminally slow growth company that owns Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, insurance, ie General RE &amp; GIECO, energy, a portfolio of consumer brands, ie Dairy Queen, Fruit of a Loom, Duracell, and a whole lotta misc, ie Precision Castparts, Clayton Homes and about 80 more. Major equity holdings, some $176B worth as of 3/13, include major positions in AAPL, BAC, WFC (declining stake), KO, and AXP. (Equity holdings are down comparably to the SP500 since their 2/14 filing.) Huge cash position of some $120B is likely overstated due to the company’s insurance liabilities. Also due to an accounting law change, unrealized capital gains now affects net income which should be adjusted for when figuring out normalized earnings. 

WFC - Too big to fail, but damnit if that doesn’t keep them from trying. News broke in 2016 that sales personal had been incentivized to reach unrealistic goals, and chose to create millions of fraudulent accounts. Upon receiving the news, management did their best to cover it up even as new cases were being brought to light. The company has been hit by billions in fines and shareholder lawsuits. The former CEO stepped down and the search for the new one took months longer than necessary. The new CEO raises commitment concerns as he refuses to move from New York to San Francisco. Deposit growth trails competitors some \~2% vs \~9%.Assets are capped at $1.9 trillion due to the Fed. It’s possible that the Federal regulators have no incentive to ever leave WFC. The world likely does not need WFC and the competitors will likely continue to eat up market share. 0.8 P/B appears attractive, but better run banks are also trading at cheap multiples.

New Positions

Note: These are tiny positions, each representing .5% - 1% of my total portfolio. I bought these stakes with the understanding that I did not fully understand each business yet.

AMZN, GOOGL, &amp; MSFT - Cloud computing looks like an infinite fish tank to me. All businesses will require more, not less computing going forward. Physical goods over physical channels continues to lose market share to digital channels. Digital goods over digital channels has uncapped potential (think streaming video, music, video games). All of that will need more computing. And given the cyclical nature of demand, it makes sense to have flexible, not fixed, supply. AMZN, GOOGL, and MSFT are currently the only notable players in this space (IBM’s offerings are reportedly laughable). Even if I’m wrong about cloud computing, and it’s merely a commoditized business that will attract outside competition and/or price wars, then those three companies still have wonderful core businesses.

AMZN - The most speculative holding. It’s possible that it’s priced to perfect and that retail will continue to integrate online shopping. Cost leadership is always a fleeting competitive advantage. However, they still have a network that’s impossible to replicate. Their Amazon Prime subscription model is incredibly sticky. I also believe there is untapped pricing potential since goods delivered to your doorstep are clearly more valuable than goods on a store shelf, but AMZN is forced to offer low prices to build up consumer habit. I’m speculating that eventually, once consumers are used to doorstep deliveries, they will gladly pay a premium over physical retail prices. If ten years from now, AMZN still had such tiny margins, then the investment will have likely been a failure.

GOOGL - Between GOOGL &amp; FB, the two basically own online advertising, which is to say advertising since conventional TV ads, newspapers, magazines, etc are all trending down. GOOGL’s propensity to burn money on blue sky projects is why I sold the company years ago —I apparently also had a revulsion towards money myself— but the core business is simply too good to ignore any longer. Also the company has a $115B net cash position that makes it trade at a lower multiple than it screens at.

MSFT - I know the least about this company. But I do know that my irrational hatred for this company has caused me to miss out on one of the greatest value plays of our time. Their productivity suite alone probably made it worth the price, with the cloud going for free. Now I believe I’m getting a wonderful business at a decent price, but more research is needed.

TTWO - Take Two Interactive makes Grand Theft Auto. With their latest iteration, GTAV (2013), they figured out how to smooth the product cycle with online gameplay &amp; purchases. GTAIII sold 15 million copies, GTAIV sold 25, and GTAV sold 110. GTAVI is coming out soon and I think the series sandbox style, online gameplay is perfect for the modern market.  

FB - The company we all love to hate refuses to go away. Fears of declining usage are apparently overgrown. FB is an advertising company with an immensely powerful network. A significant net cash position makes this company trade at a lower multiple than it’s growth would suggest."
8,2020-04-29,MoeKushnaw,1,$MSFT Earning Call - Azure?,"What do you guys think is going to happen tomorrow? Azure seems really promising especially now a days, and it’s a concept that I believe will eventually grow so much that people won’t have computers anymore.

10,2020-04-23,cavemantradez,1,Arista Networks (ANET),"Hi there, long time lurker in this sub and wsb, but figured I need some non-autist brains on this one.

For days, I have been thinking about throwing my entire savings at this bad boy. Here's why:

As far as I know, Arista provides the infrastructure to build software driven cloud networks, partnering with cloud giants like Microsoft.  From the website, quote - unquote,  'Arista Networks is a leader in building scalable, high-performance and ultra-low latency cloud networks with low power consumption and a small footprint for modern datacenter and campus environments. ' I am no expert on this, but for what it is worth, I am pretty certain cloud computing will get stretched as fuck during this coronavirus shitshow, and even more so in the (near) future where we will almost certainly experience a paradigm shift to more remote working, with cloud technologies at the forefront.

On top of that, just yesterday, Arista boasted a Cognitive Wifi solution amongst other things that mean absolutely fuck all to my autist brain. Read it up yourself, but my understanding is that it ""(harnesses) the power of the cloud, big data analytics, and automation"", "" enables higher data rates and increased capacity"" and ""provides customers with enhanced Wifi experience for critical video collaboration applications and the power of cloud-based AI for rapid problem resolution"". We all know what that mean don't we.

Ok, maybe not, which is why I am here. Any experts in this field, or just anyone who knows about Arista here could enlighten me on the potential of Arista technologies?

Moving on to the financials, this boy sure as hell looks juicy. Net income has consistently been in the uptick, with over 830 million last year, more than twice of its net income in 2018. It has 2 billion in cash, in case anything goes south which I doubt they will. Net debt is fucking 0, unlike many other companies which are already positioned far more shittily in this COVID fuck fest. Capital expenditure has also been on  a steady rise, beckoning more technologies that could help position itself as we become increasingly reliant on data networking and cloud computing. Its cash flow has also been nowhere but in the uptick. As of now, Arista hasn't really been a Wall Street's favourite with many anal-ysts maintaining their mediocre ratings. Generally, I don't see a problem with this company's financials, and with a P/E ratio of  18x -20x and its potential in the near/long term, I don't see a reason why this isn't a buy.

Ok now,enough said, I am tired as fuck. Now, roast the fuck out of me and tell me if it is retarded of me to throw money at this shit."

13,2020-04-14,tealing101,13,A New Age of Investing,"I have an idea (which may seem wild or not) that maybe old investing norms are wrong and that we don’t need diversification in our portfolios. 

Given that the biggest companies have such high market cap and they are now branching out into more sectors in which they hadn’t already started in. For example amazon offering television, delivery, cloud computing and amazon go stores etc. These ‘mega companies’ can only get more and more rich with the world depending more on their existence. This increases pressure on governments to keep them in the green and happy. So we could invest heavily in these companies which have good diversification within themselves (I know this isn’t the typical definition of diversification).

I plan to buy and hold, and never sell. Then as the market share %'s change, I would simply buy more of the under-weighted stock in proportion.

Is this a reasonable approach? Since I don't know who will come out ahead, but I am confident that cloud will dominate the next 10 years."

What are some firms that fly under the radar? I bought NOW on Reddit recommendation for $275. What are some others? I’m looking for a higher risk investment 
(again, avoid the obvious like AMZN, MSFT, etc)"
17,2020-05-01,CD_Johanna,1,Thoughts on making a long term play on IBM with its new CEO?,"While many people are talking about Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in the cloud computing war, I think IBM could be the dark horse in the race.

Ginni Rometty ran the company into the ground, but I think Arvind Krishna could be the next Nadella.

He has a PhD in engineering and was the senior VP of cloud and cognitive software. He seems committed to artificial intelligence, cloud, quantum computing, and blockchain technology.

IBM has a strong balance sheet, moat, and dividend, it isn't going anywhere, and a P/E of 10.38.

My thought is that in 10 years, IBM can be a major again with its commitment to technology of the future. 

Anything I should consider before I start investing in it?"
