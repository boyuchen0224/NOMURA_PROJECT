6,2019-06-08,Tony-epperoni,5,Let me tell yall about a potential billion dollar export company,"
The product. BNNT (Boron Nitride Nanotubes) Ultra light, super strong, incredibly resistant to heat. Harolded as the strongest material that can ever be. For 20 years (since its discovery) it has only ever been able to be produced in small quanities limiting its use. Resulting in an extremly high value (1 kilogram = $1 million)
Untill March 2017 when it was released to the world that proffesors of Deakin University have achieved a world first in successfully 3D printing BNNT which will allow for bulk quanities to be made. From this finding they were awarded a grant from the Australian Government to assist in the upscale production of BNNT. The applications for this material are endless whether it be in the aerospace, defence, automotive, energy or health industries (NASA have already expressed their excitement for this material - see Ted talk on BNNT). Everything is going to plan as they released an update this week stating that stage 1 of the upscale of BNNT was successful with stage 2 and lastly 3 will be updated upon in July and August respectively. This material could really revolutionize many industries. The properties of BNNT are extensive so research away im sure youll come away as excited as i am about this opportunity. 

The company in hand is listed on the ASX with the ticker PPK. PPK group limited owns 50% of BNNT technologies (the team behind the world first upscale production on BNNT) 

Thought id give yall a heads up"
7,2019-10-17,rated_R_Blissey,1,Thoughts on stratasys?,"I'm looking for a small cap that has the potential to be a multi bagger.  Stratasys has a 2 billion market cap and contracts with Ford and Boeing.  I read somewhere that they are going to be selling more 3d printers to boeing next year.

It is the #4 holding in the Ark Innovators fund with a 6% weighting.

It is near a 52 week low so it might be a good time to start buying.

It seems like 3d printing will become a bigger part of manufacturing in the future.

Are there any people with knowledge on 3d printing and the potential addressable market that can weigh in on stratasys? 

Thanks."
