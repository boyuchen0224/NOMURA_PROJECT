0,2016-01-28,aSimplerMan,1,Inherited IRA with crappy securities,"A 60 year old family member inherited an IRA worth around $100k. Per regulations, they must take RMDs until it is drawn down. This money can make a real positive impact on their life, so I want to keep it safe for them while still protecting against inflation.

Without going into too many details, this IRA was managed by, for all intents and purposes, someone who had no clue what they were doing. The IRA money is invested in high-fee funds, and high-risk (and poor choice) securities, like 3D printing stocks. I know, I know.

This Inherited IRA is at Morgan Stanley, and I want to move it into one or two conservative funds at Vanguard and just let it sit as it is drawn down over the years. I'd probably pick a low-fee bond fund, a low-fee total world stock fund, ~60/40 respectively, and rebalance once a year.

I am unfamiliar with how in-kind transfers work. Is there a way to change the securities the Inherited IRA is currently stuck with without selling all of it (and incurring a significant tax bill, since it is taxed as income for the inheritor, not gains, which would also bump them up a few tax brackets)? I want to get this ~$100k out of the portfolio it is in now, and into something that makes 1000x more sense.


Thank you in advance for your help, everybody."
1,2016-01-06,uhhhhjd,1,Need your thoughts on a couple things,"What is everyone thinking about the 3d printing industry now? I've seen companies (Ford and others) beginning to use them to produce parts since the process is becoming cheaper and more efficient, but I'm not sure if the time is right.

Also, marijuana. Back when Colorado legalized I saw a near 900% increase in what I held. Looking to capitalize on that again, too early now though right?

Finally, if you got into Volkswagen when they were low and palladium just before it went up, what ended up happening?"
2,2016-02-29,Vooshka,6,3D printing - Something to build on?,"Anyone have any background on this industry?

Was looking at investment possibilities for SSYS and DDD.

It seems they are trading at near record lows and the investment banks are very bearish on them.

SSYS has been printing 3D parts for Airbus for almost a year and I expected that such an endorsement would have sent their shares upwards, but it didn't.

3,2016-02-09,americanpegasus,0,"I called the recent market top and predicted the end of this tech bubble - after giving some of the best performing stocks of the preceding bull run. Now find out what's next, from the master himself.","Everyone knows I am one of the greatest oracles of the modern day.  How I have not been scooped up by some forward-thinking banking think-tank is a cosmic mystery.  
  
Consider I have given /r/investing such stocks as Netflix, Michael Kors, and 3D Systems before any of their monster runs back in 2012.  
  
Then, since early last year I've been warning that we have reached peak market conditions:

This subreddit scoffed and continues to scoff at my legendary prowess, but I don't mind.  In fact, last May I told you all that Bitcoin's return over the next 12 months would more than *double* the best performing Vanguard index fund, and **it certainly has**, soaring from $230 to $370.

If that's not enough, I also warned you about the continuing spread of negative interest rates, which are still getting worse by the day:

-------  
  
So, many of you (including top investment professionals at major firms) are probably wondering: ""Pegasus, *wow*!  What's next?""  
  
Well, I'll tell you again, like I always do.  2016 is going to be a crazy year folks; you better buckle up.  
  
**This market isn't going back up until it goes down a lot more!**  
  
I'm calling for a major crash to really punctuate this recent spiral, and I mean something nasty.  I'm expecting a spring time frame, probably in March (yes, as in next month!)  
  
Oil isn't going anywhere.  Expect capitulation to occur as we finally hit $17 a barrel, and possibly lower.  Only then will we go back up, and even then it will take a while to recover.  Bottom line: people trying to catch the falling knife in oil are gonna get burned.  
  
I expect talk of QE4 to begin after the crash though, and it won't be able to come soon enough!  Without QE4 we may see a bottom of 1100 in the S&amp;P by this time next year.  With Q&amp;E?  Well I can't foresee how much magical pretend money the government will print into the stock market, but the reckoning we will face will be the same.     
   
It's simple math: hard assets are going to be precious luxuries soon.  The paper gold market is in for an upheaval as we collectively discover that paper gold is currently a major sham, but the world isn't going back to precious metals... No, the way forward isn't shiny rocks but decentralized digital networks.  
  
This R3 thing the banks are working on?  Because they have so fundamentally misunderstood what a decentralized blockchain is, it will falter and fail.  The banks will use it, of course, in order to try to justify the millions they will spend making it.  But they will eventually abandon it in favor of a true decentralized alternative.  
  
Speaking of which, for a year now I've been intrigued and 'infiltrating' the world of new *private* digital financial networks.  These use protocol level cryptography for financial privacy.  Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero and Aeon are likely to become very big deals in coming years (but I am invested in them, and represent them, so don't take my word for it - check out the cutting edge Cryptonote protocol they are based off of).   
  
The stock market isn't going to implode forever, and I expect a new mega bull run to kick off before 2020, but it's not going to start without some pain first.   
  
Money itself is going to experience it's 'uber moment' and we may even begin to see regulated crypto-securities.  If R3 ever finds a real world niche, it could potentially be here, but I still wouldn't bet on it.  
  
Anyhow, I wouldn't be fucking with anyone at the moment, especially not the 50 - 200 P/E companies that boast 'lots of users'.  You thought LinkedIn's mega crash was news?  More are coming.  
  
You'll know when this tech 2.0 bubble has fully crashed back to Earth because we will be considering the long term viability of even juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon.  And here's where you buy back in.  
  
It's easier said than done now, because when the time comes to buy back in we may truly be in the throes of a major economic crisis.  People will scoff at owning Facebook, Google, or Apple stock but that is where you must go.  
  
The big winners in the next bull run?  The sci-fi tech of tomorrow: virtual reality, self-driving cars, digital money, 3D printing, and AI.  
  
Anyway, I've said enough.  I'm happy to see this crash finally get underway because I know that on the other side of every crash lies opportunity - I just would caution against trying to catch this one on the way down.  You may say to ""buy fear"" but I would argue we haven't even seen fear yet - we're just getting started here.  
  
As always, note that this is all my own opinion and I am not an investment professional.  I am not licensed to give financial advice to anyone, and have no current market positions, long or short.  I only own 100% cryptocurrency at the moment, which I plan to hold for the foreseeable future, and partially diversify from once this market is much lower.  
  
Feel free to disagree with me and be on the wrong side of history yet again.

4,2016-04-05,ProfitMonger,0,Trends for 20-35 year investment horizon,"I wanted to start a conversation and get feed back from the community about trends and stocks related to those trends, that will provide the greatest wealth expansion in the next 20-35 years.  I am 29 years old, have 26K in a 401K and 5K in a personal investment account.  Here are some of the things I see growing tremendously over that timeframe. Please add more! please add associated stocks and reasoning also:

3D printing-  A wide variety of materials have been made to be printable.  When the technology becomes quick enough for mass production... watch out.

FinTech- Financial Technology companies IMO will outperform the market.  Square, Paypal, AliPay, ApplePay, etc.  There is a lot of competition that may hurt the industry in the short run, but I have a CRAZY hypothesis that these companies may cause many regional and national banks to close.  Companies like Apple, Alibaba, and Samsung have enough free cash flow to provide credit to small business owners and individuals a like.  They take any payment method.  They provide instant access to funds and credit, they provide detailed analysis about the company, and provide excellent B2B relationships.

Green Energy- Wind and Solar especially will continue to advance.  Even with the low cost of oil, I believe that these energies are well positioned for the future.

Robotics- Robots will take over the world

Exoskeleton suits-  great technology for the handicapped, however i see the biggest growth in this segment coming from military and police outfits.

7,2016-06-01,Investorooni,4,Questions about investing in new-ish industries (i.e. 3D printing and cannabis testing).,"I am looking to put about 1000-2000 dollars in some new stocks because I've decided I want to expose myself to more risky opportunities (as well as diversify further). 

I currently hold:

VTI

Does anyone know of any 3D printing stocks or cannabis testing stocks that have promise for the future? I am predicting those industries will become much larger as time progresses; specifically  3D printing.

If you have other suggestions to me as an investor or simply have some stock picks you want to throw out there, please do by all means! All I ask is you provide reasoning to support your conclusions!

Thanks for reading!

9,2016-08-09,Derpderpwhat,6,How I view where to throw money at when it comes to tech moving forward.,"I often make very long posts, then I delete them, because I just get bored and close my browser, but its been itching me. This sensation to put a huge bet on the market, against my best judgements.

I want to throw money on hardware companies because of how software is forcing most computer functionality to become commoditized.

What does this mean?

Well cloud computing is basically we take all the data and processing out of the office and throw it at some server at god knows where and we just send commands to it to tell it to do whatever the hell we want the powerful server there to do.

Software makes all of this work. (Google enterprise services or MS enterprise services paired with ERP/CRM software.)

Then the short term demand for hardware will be hammered down. Large companies don't need to spend hundreds of millions on drives/engineers/cards. The clientel will literally just vanish overnight (it's happening). The customer base becomes smaller, but who's he one setting up all the cloud servers? Just a few companies, who'll they buy from? Only the best of the hardware industry.

NVDIA, INTEL, WESTERN DIGITAL, and CISCO. And with the way how each of these companies are behaving to lock their own shiny gardens. They'll win the giant trend shift as their respective industries literally go to hell.

Yeah I know peripherals exist, but fuck them, their industry in general is going to hell due to mobile devices.

I'm very serious in throwing half or 30% of my portfolio in these companies. I don't think they are as replaceable as software companies.

Edit: I'm following up on this post because I think I made every think I'm only looking at the application of hardware as in data centers. Nope, that's not the only place I'm thinking about where this tech can be applied.

I believe that the way how we design each and everything in society is preparing for a huge change. Manufacturing will become much more dispersed by 3D printing devices and more and more automated heavy machinery. More and more public infrastructure will apply more complex algorithms/programs that require high processing capacity. Not just for shipping, but water/electric distribution. Farming will become much more automated than it is now and will require a much higher necessity to process supply/demand data. Transportation is going to face a crisis of declining traffic and adopt tech or die.

This is all just a bet that is against my better judgement. And no, I don't care about your shitty data centers. What I do care about is how ubiquitous high speed Internet access will be in the future."
