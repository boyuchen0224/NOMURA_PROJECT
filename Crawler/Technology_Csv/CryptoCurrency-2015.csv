By MICHAEL J. CASEY April 29, 2015 11:04 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd.  
  
Goldman adds its name to a growing list of Wall Street institutions exploring digital-currency technology’s potential to provide faster and cheaper financial transactions and payments.  
  
Circle, based in Boston, uses bitcoin-based systems to allow customers to digitally store money and transfer it to and from other people and merchants.  
  
The new $50 million injection comes on top of $26 million in prior financing founds for Circle and, according to people familiar with the deal, values the startup at around $200 million.  
  
Goldman declined to comment about its investment beyond a brief statement in the news release from Tom Jessop, managing director of the investment bank’s Principal Strategic Investments Group. He said the investment bank sees “significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.”  
    
Circle said in a statement that the investment bank’s co-lead investor was China-based IDG Capital Partners, an early investor in Chinese Internet giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. The firm’s involvement reflects a new push from Circle to break into the Chinese market.  
  
The funding news coincides with Circle’s move to allow consumers to hold traditional currencies in their accounts in addition to bitcoin. Chief Executive Jeremy Allaire said Circle will start with dollar offerings but then provide Chinese yuan accounts and other currencies once it can do so practically and compliantly.  
  
Also joining the investment round were Circle’s existing investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners and Digital Currency Group. The firms’ individual contributions weren’t disclosed.  
  
Goldman’s commitment to Circle follows investments by the New York Stock Exchange, Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and USAA Bank in San Francisco startup Coinbase, which runs a bitcoin exchange and competes with Circle in the market for bitcoin wallets, with which users store and send digital currency.  
  
Also, UBS AG this month said it would establish a special research lab to explore financial uses for the core technology underlying bitcoin—its so-called “blockchain” digital ledger.  
  
The strategy to offer dollar-based services marks an important shift for Circle, which began as a purely bitcoin wallet service. Mr. Allaire says the inclusion of fiat currencies is consistent with the firm’s founding philosophy.  
  
“We’ve always preached this idea of the hybrid digital economy where fiat currencies can move frictionlessly around the world using bitcoin as the free Internet payment network,” Mr. Allaire said in an interview.  
  
Dollar account holders’ funds will reside with Circle’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured banking partner, Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, Calif. It is expected that similar setups will be established with regulated banking entities as Circle establishes access to yuan, euros, yen or other currencies.  
  
Unlike other fast, low-cost, dollar-based digital money-transfer platforms such as PayPal or the digital money-sharing app Venmo, which operate exclusively inside their own “closed-loop” networks, Circle’s inclusion of a bitcoin connection allows users to send money outside the firm’s network. It achieves what Mr. Allaire describes as the goal of interoperability.  
  
Circle is trying a similar strategy in the Chinese market, where hundreds of millions of mobile-phone-toting consumers frequently use closed-loop services such as Alibaba’s Alipay service and the payment app attached to Tencent’s messaging service WeChat. Mr. Allaire called China “an extremely attractive market in terms of consumer behavior and in terms of scale,” highlighting the Chinese government’s desire to develop an economy that is led by consumers that spend their money globally.  
  
It is a similar bet to one being played by Beijing-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin, which is launching a “Superwallet” for storing yuan and other currencies, giving users the capacity to use those funds to purchase goods offered for sale in other countries in bitcoins.  
  
“The opportunities for cross-border payment activity and for digital money are exploding as we speak,” says Jim Breyer, a partner at Breyer Capital and Accel Partners—both early investors in Circle, who in the past has collaborated in Chinese investments with IDG.

###Peganalysis

So what else do you need to see?  Blythe Masters is working in bitcoin space, the first bitcoin exchange fund will begin trading soon, and now Goldman Sachs can't even afford to ignore bitcoin any longer.  
  
Berkshire Hathaway, 2.92% owner of Goldman Sachs, just caused Mr. Buffet to make his first investment in the emerging tech universe of cryptocurrency.  Why?  *Because it's a smart move!*  
  
It might hurt to admit that I'm right on this one, but I am.  2016 is going to see bitcoin prices way, **way** higher than piddly $220 each.  
  
The financial universe can only send you so many wakeup calls.  It would be foolish not to have at least 1% of your portfolio in bitcoin or bitcoin-related tech at this point.

In my Vanguard account, I have a 4 Fund lazy portfolio that I can roll my 403B in to, so no real question there, I guess.  I also own STAR and a target retirement Roth.

My question is how to allocate my husband's 401K (130K).  He has a target retirement Roth as well, so what should I do with the 130K if I already own VBMFX, VTSMX, VGTSX and VGSIX in my own portfolio?

I want to avoid overlapping the same or similar funds.  We have an opportunity to branch out and I am looking for a 80/20 balanced approach that can achieve this, without his portfolio looking exactly like my own.

Thoughts and suggestions are welcomed.  I'm interested in REITs, emerging markets, IT, healthcare, energy and cryptocurrency."

8,2015-11-14,djleo,0,Hi r/investing! I'm investing in Monero,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero_(cryptocurrency)

I'm an early adopter of Bitcoin, a pseudo-anonymous, non political crypto currency. Monero can help people gain financial privacy and this is why I believe its value will increase.

Happy to try to answer any questions you may have. "
9,2015-11-04,MartEden,31,Bitcoin is going nuts,"Another day, another monster run for bitcoin traders. 

Bitcoin was trading around $240 in the beginning of October. Now — after a gain of 10% on Tuesday added to its earlier run — it's closer to $400.

Now, bitcoin traders are looking for answers as to why the cryptocurrency is skyrocketing in value."
10,2015-12-09,FCowperwood,38,The secret creator of bitcoin has been unmasked — again,"Police have raided the home of an Australian tech entrepreneur identified by two US publications as one of the early developers of the digital currency bitcoin.

On Wednesday afternoon, police gained entry to a home belonging to Craig Wright, who had hours earlier been identified in investigations by Gizmodo and Wired, based on leaked transcripts of legal interviews and files. Both publications have indicated that they believe Wright to have been involved in the creation of the cryptocurrency.

11,2015-12-08,americanpegasus,0,Everyone here needs to get familiar with something called Monero and Cryptonote. Even as cryptocurrency moves out of the nerd's basement - the greatest crypto-asset has yet to begin its ascent.,"If you know me, you will know that I have spent years studying and reading about money.  In my stock trading days, I made some good picks and enjoyed the support and arrogance of many members of this community.  But honestly?  I've made the most progress while learning about the *nature* of money itself.  
  
I've spent the last 2+ years reading about cryptocurrencies non-stop.  I also have been pretty dead-on as far as bitcoin adoption in the past few years.  
  
So let me take a moment and tell you that the next 'big' thing may not be bitcoin at all, but it's overlooked (and secretly more attractive sister).  
  
This is a subject that could fill a book but I'll outline several key points to pique your interest in hopes you'll do your own DD.  It's not too hard to actually own Monero, but I'm not here to pump up something I already own - I hope that you will do the research and come to the same conclusion that I have: the ascent of crypto is inevitable, as is the ascent of Monero.  
  
**Critical Point #1:**  The financial sector is rife with talks of the 'blockchain'.  But you simply cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin, as much as Goldman Sachs and Blythe Masters would like to.  This is the foolish equivalent of Russia claiming they don't like the internet so they are committing themselves to building their *own* internet.  
  
Bitcoin is an open-source network, and with any open-source and decentralized financial network things are proceeding as they should - often chaotic with many surges and crashes on the way to ultimate stability (which occur at a much higher price point than now).  
  
**Critical Point #2**: Bitcoin is remarkable in that it advanced money in a very real way beyond what was currently possible but it is *not* the holy grail of digital money that many computer scientists and economists had dreamed of.  
  
Consider the following chart:  http://postimg.org/image/aqjmkgusp/  
  
- We had decentralized and private money for thousands of years with gold.  
- The 'digital dollar' gave us digital and private money (to some degree - banks and processing institutions still had to track you to process your money).  
- Bitcoin came along gave us digital money that no entity owned for the first time but at a cost: everyone can browse every bitcoin transaction back to the beginning of time.  This is obviously unsuitable as a default behavior of a currency - privacy must be built-in, it cannot be some optional add on feature.  Imagine having to obscure every sensitive credit card transaction you make so that it wouldn't be totally public knowledge.  
- Monero (as the largest and most successful implementation of the Cryptonote protocol) emerged from anonymous sources in 2014.  It is not some stock, or some silly nerd toy.  It is no less than the *holy grail of digital money itself* combining for the first time in human history the elements of digital, decentralized, and private.  
  
How does it do this?  By way of something called ""cryptographic ring signatures"".  You can either trust the egg heads who designed it that it works like magic, or develop the ph.D level mathematical knowledge to verify it yourself.  Either way, know this is likely one of the most sophisticated computational objects our species has ever created.  
  
Not only that but it also improves many fundamental aspects of Bitcoin:  
  
- Not happy that Bitcoin is deflationary?  Monero has a small perpetual tail emission that means that miners will always have more Monero to mine.  (after the initial 18.4 million, approximately 400k per year will be minable in perpetuity)  
- Not happy with the blocksize debates raging across the Bitcoin landscape?  Monero uses a variable size blocksize and a per-kb fee so that those debates will never happen on this blockchain.  
- Worried about total privacy being banned by the law (and more likely the IRS)?  Well Monero has **two** keys.  One is a private key that lets you spend your money, and the other is a view key that lets you (or another trusted party) view your balance without actually giving them access to spend it.  
  
This is not a stock, or a commodity.  This is not some get rich scheme (although many will get rich in the coming years on it).  This is nothing less than the new dominant form of money for our entire global civilization.  
  
And you are one of the very lucky few who just learned about it first.  
  
The future will be filled with anonymous money transactions whizzing through the internet at the speed of light, instantly and with no one's permission.  The fees will be a micro-fraction of what are being paid today, and it will be just like the birth of the internet all over again.  
  
This is the 2020's staring you in the face, folks.  
  
Don't be left behind: Educate yourself.  
  
Yes, Monero are only 30 to 60 cents each at the moment, and yes if they succeed in becoming the dominant private financial network on Earth then that per-unit price will likely go to some absurd number that you wouldn't believe if I told you.  You probably wouldn't have believed that 50 cent bitcoins in 2011 would be worth over $1000 by 2014, but it still happened.  
  
That's not the point though - to create a brand new, decentralized financial network from nothing you have to make a few people rich.  There is no other way to do it.  The point is that the future of finance is in cryptography and blockchains and you need to either understand it or retain the talent that does if you hope to continue to be a relevant player over the next 20 years.  
  
If you have any serious inquiries about Monero or blockchains, I will be happy to answer them here and you are always welcome to join us over on /r/monero for more talk about Cryptonote or our project.  If you were one of the one's who scoffed at Bitcoin (like I did) in 2009 - 2012 even as it began it's meteoric ascent, this is your moment of redemption.  
  
Let's not make the same mistakes.  
  
Thanks for your time.
