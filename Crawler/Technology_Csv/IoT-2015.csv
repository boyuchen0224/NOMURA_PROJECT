The link below suggests a few companies. They're a little pricey I think, but I guess that's just the state of the market.

Anyone else have some good picks in mind? Or am I just a sucker buying into the bubble?"
1,2015-02-17,el_el,10,Internet of Things and IPv6 Stocks,"Hello everybody, I'm looking for resources or suggestions on the development and market expansion of IoT technology.  To share my meager findings and not just ask, I'm currently keeping an eye on Intel, Cisco, and ARM.

Additionally, I could use some pointers on what to read or keep track of for IPv6 implementation.  Many thanks!"
2,2015-03-29,theonly101,54,Let's talk about BBRY.,"Blackberry (BBRY) posted a surprising profit ($0.04 EPS) and larger than expected deterioration in revenues ($660mm) on Friday. Analysts expected cash burn, instead about +200mm free cash flow.

The Numbers:

- Market Cap is now ~5bn

- Cash is now 3.27bn (highest in company history) with 1.5bn in convertible debt

- Net Cash suggests core BBRY worth ~3.2bn

- Guidance for Software is 600mm through inorganic and organic growth from approx. 250mm last year

- Software revenue growth rate compared to other software companies with similar margins could value the business from $1.5-2.5bn (Conservative to Most Aggresive)

- Company will be acquisitive in software moving forward

- Company positioned well with BBM, BES12, QNX operating system and their initiatives in the IoT

- Service business continues to deteriorate, but hardware business seems promising and stabilizing

- Guidance for Hardware ASP implies increase. 90% of hardware sold was new generations. Bad inventory is gone

- AT&amp;T and Verizon stores did not contribute to full quarter of hardware sales (more like 1/3). ATM Classic sell 2 per 1 Passport

- So, market implies hardware, services, patents, and property valued ~ 0.7-1.7bn which seems very low with rising ASP and higher gross margins moving forward

- FCF guidance is positive. If company generates 500mm cash this year (conservative given past two Q), the company trades at net cash 6x forward FCF which again seems very low


Things to consider:

- Lots of cash generated this Q was through investments

- Not much details on EZ-Pass conversions to BES12. Cause for concern.

- Company may have to drop hardware business at some point and only focus on software

- Street can remain bearish, sentiment is pretty low now. Analysts argue easier to cut costs and get EPS than stabilize revenues (agreed to an extent)

tl;dr BBRY could be a great speculative buy, and it's starting to generate lots of cash with better gross margins and (hopefully) revenue stabilization and growth. Nonetheless, do your own DD.

What are your thoughts?"

7,2015-04-04,GwenythLairdPernie,8,INTC and QCOM — Internet of Things Stocks Worth Following,"The purpose of this report was to pick the best IoT stocks (from the 13 in the blue tables (http://aoiclub.com/?page_id=77) previously posted) that hold the best potential for future growth. I was looking for financially stable and efficient companies with good valued stock.

1. First I narrowed my search by selecting those companies with net profits near equal or higher than industries averages and ROEs greater than 15.  Eight made the cut.

CSCO
INTC
SAP
SWKS
ARMH
QCOM
RHT
PTC
2.  Next the search was narrowed to companies with a Debt to Capitol Ratio of Less than 80% industry average.  Four made the cut.

INTC
SWKS
ARMH
QCOM

3. Next, I looked for stocks with 5 year ESP greater than 15%-20%

INTC –  15.92
QCOM  –  26.85
SWKS   – 29.44
ARMH   31.66

4.  Then I eliminated stocks that don’t pay dividends; in this case, all do.

5. Next, I evaluated if the stock was at a good value by looking for stocks with a P/E TTM less than 10, a P/E 5 year of less than 20, a PEG TTM of less than 1 and a P/B MRQ of less than 1.5.

Because none of these 4 stocks meant these standards, I decided to determined the actual market values of the stock.

ESP TTM	ESP TTM industry average	P/E TMM industry average	Actual Market Value	Current Market Value
INTC	$2.32	$1.75	19.70	$45.70	$30.98
QCOM	$4.73	$1.87	25.64	$121.28	$67.92
SWKS	$2.90	$1.75	19.70	$57.13	$96.19
ARMH	$0.80	$1.75	19.70	$15.96	$49.11
Results show that INTC and QCOM are undervalued; and SWKS are ARMH are overvalued.

6.  Based on the above analysis, and at this time, I conclude that INTC and QCOM are potentially the best, out of the original 13 IoT stocks, to follow for future investment."
8,2015-10-29,helpmelearn20,0,Opinions on BBY (BestBuy)?,"Hi,
Any take on BBY as a short to medium term investment? I see a good few things going for them: (i) tie up with hot product manufacturers (ii) geek squad that should get more and more successful as IoT gains mainstream adoption.

What's your take? Bullish or bearish for short to medium term? Thanks."
9,2015-10-09,MartEden,0,"Cloud wars: Amazon, Alibaba make big moves","Alibaba's cloud division has opened a second data center in Silicon Valley while Amazon has announced a slew of new features for its cloud service, as tech giants jostle for the top spot in a rapidly growing market.
By having an increasing number of data centers spread worldwide, Alibaba is hoping fast-growing start-ups, especially those in Silicon Valley, will begin to use its services as they look to tap the Chinese market.

AWS announced new division to support the fast-growing Internet of Things (IoT) market. This relates to smart devices such as lightbulbs or smoke alarms that are connected to the internet. AWS's new service will allow developers to link these devices to Amazon's cloud to allow them to communicate with each other and remote servers in order to process data and carry out their tasks.

Who will be the winner?"
