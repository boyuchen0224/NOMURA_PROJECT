0,2018-01-29,SergeantROFLCopter,0,Is this a smart strategy for working with early stage startups?,"Basically I would seek companies that extremely early stage and purchase options from them and offer consulting services. I am very technical (can prototype hardware, can program in ~20 languages, etc, am familiar with IoT techniques and Machine Learning, etc) and have early stage entrepreneur experience. Then I would guide them to angel groups or Y Combinator, etc.

So maybe I buy the option to buy 10% at $1,000,000 evaluation with a $10,000 premium. I would do this knowing what the $10,000 is going to be spent on, guiding them on how to spend it to get more investable.

Y Combinator buys in at a $1.7M and then those companies average at $9M only several months later.

5,2018-02-05,InterestingNews1,2,Micron looks cheap and fears about a DRAM downturn seem to be overdone,"With a PE of 6.3 Micron is cheap as bears believe an increase in DRAM supply will collapse prices and profits while bulls believe huge increases in applications will drive demand and consolidation in the industry will control supply.

To me the bulls seem to have covered off all of the bears' issues. 

Samsung and SK Hynix have plans to increase supply which overall is expected to grow by 22% in 2018 which is pretty well balanced against expected demand growth.  https://epsnews.com/2017/11/07/samsung-end-tight-dram-supply-earlier-expected/

That suggests pricing will remain stable.

Secondly customers arent that bothered as memory makes up a fairly small percentage of costs so demand is fairly inelastic and with increasing applications in IoT, cloud, cryptocurrencies - demand is increasing.

The one exception is China which has become increasingly vocal in its protestations about DRAM prices - increasing speculation that Chinese suppliers will enter the market and increase capacity.

However the drones and satellites of Wall Street analysts have been focussing on Chinese DRAM production capabilities and pretty much universally concluded that any serious production remains years away.

With that in mind Micron does look very cheap on a PE of 6.3.  Along with the other players in the oligoly it seems very happy with maintaining the status quo and maintaining long term stability.

**Value Stocks**
Good article in Seeking Alpha this week on New York &amp; Co (NWY - New York &amp; Company Is Worth $4 Per Share).  The stock is trading on a EV/EBITDA ratio of 5.  Not bad for a company that just reported 3% comp growth and guided for 23% EBITDA growth in H1 2018.

In Fool.com on Tuesday there was a write up about the three top retail stocks.  The first company covered was The Michaels Companies (MIK).  As an arts &amp; craft retailer it faces less competition than most from Amazon and is growing rapidly with Q4 samestore sales increasing 2.5%, net sales 8% and adjusted EPS up 16%. The 5 year consensus is for EPS growth of 11% but thats done little for the stock which trades on a trailing twelve month PE of just 9.1


**Insider Buying**
On Thursday Nasdaq.com reported Whitehorse Financial (WHF) Chairman John Bolduc bought $90k of stock April 2nd in his fifth purchase in two years.  It’s a vote of confidence in Whitehorse which makes private loans to companies and has seen earnings rise 50% in three years yet trades on a PE of 7.1 and yields 11%.(Beware this is a microcap with high risk)


**Special Situations**
On Wednesday Marcello Pinto wrote in Seeking Alpha that Monsanto (MON) looks cheap whether the planned Bayer acquisition goes ahead or not. Completion of the acquisition yields a 9% return while downside appears minimal given stock is trading on 22 times trailing earnings compared to a historic average of 25. Restoring the multiple of 25 times 2018 estimates would increase the stock price by about 20%


**Dividend**
Umpqua Bank (UMPQ) believes it is the best bank in the world.  Apparently they say so when they answer the phone.  There's no doubt its a well run bank with excellent credit quality and an outstanding service level that yields a significant competitive advantage.  But best of all it has a 4% dividend. Seeking Alpha article by Herding Value on Tuesday 

**Growth Stock**
Cypress Semiconductor (CY) looks like growth at a reasonable price as market leader in IoT, SRAM memory chips, USB-C controllers, and other USB solutions.  Analysts expect 37% earnings growth this year while the trailing PE is a reasonable 20.  Fool article on Monday “3 Top Value Stocks to Buy in April”.

For the record, I have no known connection to any of these articles, the author or website. I don’t own the stock. I am not being paid to write this. I am not a bot. I just found the articles interesting.

9,2018-05-11,daynightcase,72,Betting big on GOOGLE (GOOG),"I have about ~35% exposure in Tech.
NVID - 3%
AAPL - 7%
AMAZ - 7%
GOOG - 18%

I have been holding some GOOG shares since it was at ~840 and yesterday I added 6 more. 

I am not good at evaluating companies but when I look around GOOG is slowly taking over and there is still so much potential growth. 

1). Data - Google has so much data. It is INSANE. They know about billions of humans and their behavior, business, streets, pictures (with google photos) It is absolutely nuts. which brings me to my next two point (AI and Cars)

2). AI - we know that AI is going to be a huge part of our everyday life going forward. And with the amount of data GOOGLE has, they are on the TOP spot to leverage and make their AI the best. This isn't even an opinion right? FB, Microsoft, and Amazon doesn't even have fraction of data that Google has. And AI is all about machine learning, and the more data you feed, smarter it gets. 

3). Automobile- This is uncharted territory, no one has been able to penetrate and challenge the big car giants like GM, Toyota, Audi etc. Once Elon Musk was asked a question, who does he see as his competitor and his answer was Apple. I don't know if he was being ignorant or genuinely don't see Google as a major competitor.    

Google's approach to automobile is same as their approach to Android. They do what they do the best (create software and services) and let the hardware people make the hardware. Seems like they are on the same path with cars, they are creating the best selfdriving system and infrastructure and just going to sell this to other car manufactures, who already know how to build cars. And just like Pixel line up, we might see cars made by Google at some point. But the point is, how can anyone not see Google as a serious competitor is beyond my understanding. 

I still haven't talked about their new silicon initiative and IoT stuff. Its safe to say, it all looks very promising to me

What do you guys think about Google in general? Positive, negative or neutral?"

15,2018-11-09,Crizzzuu,1,"Are all cryptocurrencies scams and useles? Is blockchain just a buzzword to atract dumb investors to throw money at the ones raising funds? well, Yes and No.","At this point, most of you must've heard something about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Good and bad, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

* *The insane ROI on coins going + 36 000% in a year with hundreds of millions in USD transacted daily*
* *The amounts of innocent people getting scammed who didn't know any better*
* *The people taking out loans and second mortages on their houses, just to lose it all in gambling on crypto currencies*
* *The illegal washtrading and blatant market manipulations going on*
* *The benefits of using the open, auditable immutable distriburtued ledger technologies that blockchain has to offer*
* *This one you must've heard, ""only criminals, scammers and terrorists use cryptocurrencies""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to summarise, you have heard alot of bad things about it, but the is alot of good aswell. Most of what you have heard is true, there is alot of criminal activity, tax evasion, scams, market manipulation etc. going on, im not going to lie about it. But that is not at all what blockchain and crypto is about. There are several bad actors going around and tarnishing the whole space. Blockchain and crypto is a legit movement which aims to better and improve existing industries such as:

* *FinTech.*
*  *IoT.*
* *supplychain management.*
* *preventing fraud and high markups by middlemen,*
*  *providing actual sound money for people in developing countries where there is always a fear of hyper inflation of the local currency due to highly uncapable leaders. (look at venezuela, argentina, turkey, zimbabwe etc.)* 
* *providing verifyable identities to people without identities, can you imagine living without being to verify who you are?*
* *financial inclusion, providing banking services to people with no access to them*
* *tracking and verifying authenticity of a product / good / collectible*

These are just a set of examples what blockchain and crypto can and probably will improve on. Now, dont get me wrong. Currently many, if not most cryptocurrencies are actual scams and money grabs from innocent people tryng to get those incredible gains of 100x ROI, chasing pumps and losing their money.

The key when looking up and investing in cryptocurrencies is extensive research and analyzing of a company and its staff, being patient and not to ""FOMO"" (Fear Of Missing OUT) and finding these companies providing a solution to a problem or an actual upgrade to what the legacy system has to offer. Don't go throwing your money at something someone else recommended to you. Do your own research, it has to be extensive and thorough, otherwise you might just go to a roulet table, put it all on red and wish for the best. Most of the  companies runnig a crypto / blockchain don't even need it. They have no use of it and only try to ride the hype which the ""blockchain buzzword"" offers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just as an example, im going to provide you info on a Canadian company called Adbank and im hoping to give you a different perspective on the crypto and blockchain industry. If you change your mind (assuming all you think about when you hear crypto is ""ponzi, scam and criminal activity"") and start allocating a samll % of your portfolio into crypto, I hope you keep in mind that it is very risky at all times and do some serious contemplating if it's actually a good idea to put some money into what ever it is you are thinking of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about adbank, i'm going to provide you with some background on the online ad-industry, which Adbank is providing its services to. 

The online ad-industry is a place where ad-fraud is running rampant. The internet is riddled with bot traffic (any wehre form 40-60% of internet traffic is bots), advertisers lose 1/3 of their moeny to bots watching their ads and it's actually the second largest source of income for criminal organizations, second to none but illegal drugs. Can you imagine that?

There is a russian group of hackers, who make 3 000 000 USD on a daily basis due to them runnig a few bots. [Adweek actually released an article about this group, which you can read here.](https://www.adweek.com/digital/russian-ring-digital-ad-crooks-reportedly-making-over-3-million-day-175194/)

There is little or close to none transparency in the industry, which industry giants such as google and facebook have been sued several times for. Both advertisers and publishers are pretty helpes in these cases and there was no improvement in sight until blockchain. here are a few articles for youto read if you want to verify:

[https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/06/google-and-facebook-sued-over-failure-to-disclose-political-ad-spending/](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/06/google-and-facebook-sued-over-failure-to-disclose-political-ad-spending/)

[https://hackernoon.com/why-adtrader-is-suing-google-and-why-most-advertisers-might-never-get-that-chance-again-2bc3ee376d0c](https://hackernoon.com/why-adtrader-is-suing-google-and-why-most-advertisers-might-never-get-that-chance-again-2bc3ee376d0c)

&amp;#x200B;

The industry also has a problem with payment times, sometimes ranging between a week or two to motnhs.

Now that we have established some sort of understanding what problems the industry has, lets open up how blockchain can provide solutions to them. I'm not going to go into detail on how blockchain and smart contracts work, due to me not being tech savvy enough and it would probably double the length of this already long post. But i will shortly and very simply tel you what can be achieved.

Through blockchain technology all the transactions become transparent and auditable. What this means basically is that every advertiser can verify that their money is going to the right place and no where else. This kind of transparency has never been seen in this space. heres a quote from the SVP of customer experience at adweek when talking about piloting Adbanks tech:

 

&gt;*“We are excited to be experiencing the way blockchain is providing a new level of accountability and transparency in ad technology. Adbank is delivering on a concept that appeals to the entire marketing ecosystem — and we look forward to seeing how the industry will evolve when it’s deployed at scale”*  
&gt;  
&gt;*David Saabye, SVP of Customer Experience @ Adweek*

&amp;#x200B;

Through smart contracts, the Adbank platform will be able to provide realtime payments for every ad watched, so that the transaction from advertiser to publisher happens in realtime when running an ad-campaign.

Adbank has developed an AI (which they have a patent pending on) which tracks every traqnsaction within their ecosystem and flags fraudulent activity so that a human can double check situation and ""follow the money"" so to say, if a transaction is deemed fraudulent, actions will be taken. Now remember, this is putting it very simplisticly, there is a set of different algorithms, code and procedures taking place in tracking the fraudulent activity. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all could just be so called ""fluff"" and have nothing backing it up. How do you verify that anything they say is true and not all just a big sham? It's not unheard of in the crypto space. 

There are articles and pressreleases by the parties involved, events that the company attends to and different statements from 3rd parties. Adbank has run pilot campaigns with the Austrian government body ANTO and RedBull, aswell as with adweek and flixxel. An article has been published on forbes about it, you can read about it [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ginaclarke/2018/09/25/the-viral-video-that-convinced-the-austrian-national-tourism-office-to-embrace-blockchain/#f9bf52c1b5ae). 

Adbank has attended the United Nations forums about blockchain and actually been awarded.

[https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-cso-kelsey-cole-receives-award-at-united-nations-on-international-peace-day-833a23417fbb](https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-cso-kelsey-cole-receives-award-at-united-nations-on-international-peace-day-833a23417fbb)

They have founded the blockchain research commitee at IAB (Interactive Advertisment Buerau), all the big players within the industry is apart of it. [https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-joins-interactive-advertising-bureau-iab-to-start-blockchain-committee-d85c51e58f96](https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-joins-interactive-advertising-bureau-iab-to-start-blockchain-committee-d85c51e58f96)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to post about all of their achievments, but you can read more about them here, [in their medium blog.](https://medium.com/@adbank)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'ts these kinds of ""gems"" the more serious crypto investors are searching for, with a real usecase and a service to provide. The ones that follow all the regulations and are actually legit companies working to provide a solution to a problem. There is so much potential in this space and in a few years time, we will see that blockchain will actually provide some game changing services to different industries. I'ts up to the savvy investors to take advantage of the current situation regarding the uncertanty surrounding the space and make some life changing investments. Adbank's marketcap is currently at 2 000 000 USD which is comparable to the lower penny stocks. The risk / reward ratio on throwing in a few hundred to thousand bucks on a promising project like this is unheard of.

&amp;#x200B;

If this post even made you look at crypto a little differently, my job here is done.

Thank you and happy ""gem"" hunting.
