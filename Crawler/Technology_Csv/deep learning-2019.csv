0,2019-01-15,Daviddaprodigy,1,Advice for someone with no bills/debt?,"I'm gonna try to make this as short as I can to get to the point faster but essentially as the title states, I need advice as someone who is pursuing Financial independence.

I'm 21 YO, live with my mom(occasionally stay with my dad)

Pay no bills whatsoever(aside from my gas and food)

Currently work at Home Depot full-time getting $12 an hour.

I live in Houston, TX and plan to settle here for good.

I spent the first half of last year working part-time and in college full-time(dropped out, wasn't my thing), then went to Full-time at my job. I made really dumb decisions and spent my money on things I like(Manga, video games, ETC.) as if I was already retired. But thanks to those decisions I came to the realization that I can't enjoy the fruits of my labor doing what I currently do so I am now GREATLY pursuing early retirement. 2 days off a week is certainly not enough time to enjoy all the activities I REALLY want to dedicate my time to. Some of the people I work with have been with the company for 15-20+ years and are still working their asses off now in their 50s-60s! I respect the work ethic but personally, I do not see myself still working a full-time job even at my 40s :( In a way, seeing them kind of motivates me to work harder towards FIRE. I also don't want to keep leeching off of my mother and plan on paying her back once I achieve stable income.

I'm currently diving deep into stock investments and learning everything I can about many different sources of income to achieve financial stability/early retirement as soon as I possibly can. I've asked many people at my job for financial advice or what they would have done differently at my age and that's where I got my stock motivation from. Everyone at my job calls me a madman because they think i'm too young to be stressing about this since most people my age are apparently just wilding out partying and living their life. Sadly, I can't live like that or I will remain in this same spot until i'm 40 and just the thought of that is TERRIFYING to me! I'm ready to start this excruciating journey and work harder than I ever have before! I'm a starving wolf for this prey we call FIRE(Financial Independence/Retire Early) and I ain't stopping this chase until I hunt it down!

To make this easier I thought i'd also describe the type of life-style i'm aiming for in the future.

MAYBE a wife(very big maybe) and NO KIDS AT ALL.

A 150K-300K house(you can get a very beautiful home here in Houston with that!)

A truck like the one I currently drive but up to date(F-150 sports)

Go back into bodybuilding.

Go to gaming/anime conventions every once in a while.

Start a consistent gaming comedy youtube channel i've always wanted to do.

And draw my manga(Japanese style comic) that i've been writing for the past 2 years. (this one is the main reason I need A LOT of time and is another big factor in my pursuit for FIRE)

and that's it. I'm a really simple guy who isn't at all into luxury goods. Not big on traveling outside the US either, maybe once or twice that's it.

So that being said, any advice out there that can help me change my world around this year?"

A couple months ago I started to dive deep into affiliate marketing, (note I have been creating online businesses for around 5+ years full time) I have been learning so much about internet marketing and I finally have been seeing some success in my recent affiliate project.

I have saved up an extra 50k in the bank and I would like to invest this money. What would be the best thing to do in our opinion?

Thanks in advance!"
4,2019-08-30,rossenow,14,Quick guide for all beginners asking the same questions,"Guys, after i spent some time on this sub i noticed that there are many people asking the same questions. Below are some points for newbies that i believe will be helpful and will help some of you. Also i'll try to answer some of the most asked questions.

○ Don't try to time the market. Nobody actually timed the market very successfully. If you try to time the market you risk to miss big opportunities if it goes up while you wait and you don't know how long you'll need to wait. Secondly there is no way for newbies and even more advanced investors to know when the deepest dip is and to buy there. Don't even try to deceive yourself that you'll time the market and will buy the dip and you'll be the most successful newbie investor. That's one of the biggest mistakes every investor is doing. Even if by sheer luck you time the market it doesn't mean it'll do what you want it do to. Bottom line is don't keep your money waiting for the dip, you don't know how deep the dip is going to be. Try to invest smart don't try to be lucky. Dollar cost averaging is one of the best strategies for retail investor everybody can do. A good quote is ""Time in the market, beats timing the market""

○ For all people that want to learn about investing/stocks etc. there are many sites with valuable information. See investopedia, read bloomberg/wsj/forbes/yahoo finance/the motley fool. Don't just ask i am a newbie where do i start? Just start somewhere, there are plenty of books on investing which are pretty easy to find on amazon and google. One of the books i am recommending is ""Intelligent Investor"" start there if you wish. With time you'll be able to find more finance news and books. The only thing all beginners can do is a simple google search.

○ As an inexperienced investor one of the best investment you can do is invest in index tracking ETF with low expense ratio. All questions related to ""I am new where do i invest?"" will have the same answer. Once you start reading more and more and get better understanding of the market/investing etc you'll begin developing own analysis on companies and you'll be able to decide where to invest.

○ In terms of stock brokers it depends on where you are legally residing. If you're in the US there are plenty of options, almost all banks will allow opening a brokerage account. For newbies try Robinhood (cheap trades). For non-US the options are a bit limited in EU we have Interactive Brokers/Saxo Bank/Degiro (in some countries) and also some country specific brokers which will work with other big brokers.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you start reading and learning more and more things will become clearer with time. Nothing comes easy with investing you'll have gains and losses but you'll learn from them. Investing is not a short-term gain. Also remember that trading and investing are quite different in their nature."
5,2019-12-23,MoonCruise,1,Boring ho-hum anecdotal hum-drum dolled out yet again,"I don’t make much money- especially if I compare my salary to those I often see on here. But I am rock-solid comfortable with where I am and where I am going, financially speaking, due to some pretty simple things. I was going to respond to someone else asking a question on here, but when the response grew out of scope of the question, I figured I’d just throw it out as its own post for whoever wants to look into the same old boring “advice” about how to build financial comfort without the compulsion to get thrills from “outperforming the market” or whatever so and such. Just sound, well-understood ideas that I’ve employed to become “financially comfortable” without being the smartest or the highest paid guy around. Here ya go:

Fight temptation towards material excess and pay yourself first. Better yet, start some “set and forget” deposits that go straight to interest-bearing accounts without you ever handling the money.

Start slow, but stay disciplined long term- growing your rate of saving/investing at at least the same rate as your income. That is to say, if you become comfortable putting away $100/month on a $50k salary, you should have at least grown to putting away $200/month if you reach a $100k salary. 
That said, assuming that you were making ends meet by stashing $100/month at a $50k salary, it should be reasonable to suggest you can afford to put away much more than $200/month if you have kept your spending/lifestyle relatively in check (given a $50k/year increase in money you apparently didn’t need before).

As stated, I really don’t have any epiphany to offer, but I can give you a little “inspiration” telling you how simplifying expenses, living within my means, and religiously (but largely HANDS-OFF) paying myself first has come along this far. The overarching idea is to simply exercise intent with your money while taking as much “will-power” out of the equation as possible (we typically have enough to do in *getting* the money in the first place without a hundred extra tasks added on to figure out how to save/invest it).

Long-term/retirement.
I started working eight and a half years ago- and I was making DOG SHIT money. But my expenses were minimal and covered, so I started out pushing 10% of my base-pay into the retirement account my job offered right away. 

Fast forward, and I’m still not making “the big bucks”. But, in that time, I’ve consistently upped my contributions to my retirement account (the “TSP”; mine is the govt version of a Roth IRA) to where I am now (have been for a little while) pushing 20% of my base-pay in there. I’ve never once “missed” that money as it is an automatic allocation that never even hits my bank account. I simply go in periodically and adjust the allocation proportionally to the additional discretionary income I get whenever I get a raise/promotion. 

This doesn’t mean I have kept my expenses beaten back to where they were when I first started working for less than $25k a year; I just mean that as my discretionary spending has grown with my salary, I’ve made sure to grow my rate of retirement contributions (and other savings/investments) along with it. (I grew up broke as hell, and I’ll be damned if I’m gonna have my kids surviving on ramen and hotdogs while I stingily horde away a more comfortable lifestyle for them so that they can fight over my will one day... Anyways... ) 
I don’t have to do anything to that account- I just keep that automatic deduction funding the same, boring “lifecycle 2050” fund month after month, and after about 8 and a half years, it is sitting at right over $50k (with no matching contribution from my employer/Uncle Sam). Seeing that sitting at nearly double the value of what I have contributed to it is motivation to keep doing it. 

I also fund CDs with my bank (credit union) to keep my “emergency fund” safe while accruing a little interest. (If you’re comfortable with it, you can seek out higher interest CDs or savings with other banks, but I’ve never gotten into that.) 
By initially throwing an extra lump-sum of cash at the CDs,  and following up by putting $100/month (that came about as discretionary spending) towards that, I’ve kept those CDs at around $8k without ever giving it any real thought or effort (automatic reallocation from my liquid savings account). They’re not gonna make me rich, but I have them on standby (gaining about $15/month) “just in case”. Fully funded at $8k, the $100/month that was going towards the CDs again becomes discretionary income (along with the ~$15/month in interest). I have been thinking about pushing the emergency CDs up to $12k, tho..

Mid-long-term/“mini-retirement”/supplemental income.
Once I was happy with how my retirement account was being funded (with money I never missed), and I had enough stashed in CDs to cover emergency expenses, I started funding an individual (non-tax-advantaged) brokerage account with TD Ameritrade with an automatic deposit of $50/month (while enjoying a little of the extra spending money that was freed up after funding the retirement and emergency funds). The allocation to the individual brokerage account has since grown to $75/week- an amount I’ve pushed up as my net income has grown, never deviating *too* far from where I started in terms of discretionary income. 
The idea behind this brokerage account is to grow a separate stream of dividend income to supplement my pension (and/or disability, whichever comes first) pay when my military career comes to an end (no matter how long and/or prestigious a military career, it is ultimately a “dead-end job” that we will all at some point either leave voluntarily or be forced out of). 

Anyways- I’m about three years into funding that brokerage account (not always hitting the mark on which stonks I chose to buy, but getting better as I learn my place), and it is sitting between $18-19k (depending on the news on the day I check it). An additional comfort of the brokerage account is I have liquidity along with a “growth” oriented investment: I am more-or-less free to withdraw the entire amount at any time, simply paying any applicable taxes (if I withdraw from my “real retirement account” before I am ~55 years old, I have to deal with some significant bureaucracy and penalties and such).

Debt management. 
Back to the “emergency fund” CDs. I am generally not in the “debt hawk” camp- I can look at the numbers and do the math on how certain debts can be managed to financial success. 
But, earlier this year, I started listening to a little too much Dave Ramsey, cashed out those CDs (my credit union cashes out CDs same-day, zero-hassle; they just deduct the taxes on the applicable interest and free up the cash for use), and used a bit of my liquid savings to pay off all my debts: about $7k towards remaining student loans (after 8 years of minimum payments), and about $12k towards paying off my (our family) vehicle (after almost 2 years of minimum payments that didn’t seem to be making a dent). Haven’t missed that money at all (I stashed it with intent by controlling spending), and due to the “extra” income that freed up (along with some travel reimbursements from work), I got those CDs right back to the $8k mark in the 6 or so months since- while building our liquid savings account higher than it’s ever been (or even really needs to be, frankly- prompting me to consider reallocating the additional amount to something with a better return- like increasing the amount in our emergency CDs).

Paying off all debts wasn’t *only* due to the hypnotic sax-solo-induced trance of Dave Ramsey. The interest on the student loans, especially, was low enough to be effectively “interest-free” when considering inflation.. 
But- I knew I was moving back to Hawaii and wanted to buy a house at the best current interest rate (they’ve been low, y’all). I knew I LOVED Hawaii based on my first tour, and I knew where the military renters were concentrated, as well as the “BAH” (Basic Allowance for Housing) we get on Oahu- so I knew exactly what to look for in a place my family and I could live for the next few years, turn into a viable rental property when/if the navy sends us elsewhere, and move back to when it’s all said and done. With all that intent in mind, I made the decisions I made. 
Back to the debt- I’ve bought and sold a home previously, so I knew a bit about the process, and I wanted the strongest “debt to income ratio” I could have when applying for credit on the ridiculous amount of money required to buy an entry-level home on Oahu. Since (as stated) I am not the highest-paid guy around, and I don’t stand to come into any significant bump in salary anytime soon, going in with zero debt was my strongest play at benefiting that debt/income ratio. That worked out well for me in getting my mortgage/property— and, having no other debts has made paying down the house much more manageable.  

More on intent.
Plan for your larger, expected, “non-emergency” expenses that you will “probably” have to go beyond your normal spending habits to pay. It can be easy to simply dismiss these sorts of things with a reserve line of credit, but I won’t *plan* to use credit on anything I can reasonably plan to pay cash for. 
Again- automatic reallocation to a separate fund for an explicit use should take all of the “will-power” out of it. Just figure up what you think you’ll need, what you know you can afford to throw at it, and do your best to make those two meet with the automatic transfer. 
For me- as a sailor, husband, and father of two- I know that about once per year, I am going to have to shell out some serious money for MY family (nuclear) to visit OUR families (extended). So, I allocate $200/month to a separate 12-month CD with the express intent of cashing it out at maturity (or before, Navy Federal doesn’t care) for travel expenses. In the time I have been doing this, the yearly trip has been a non-issue, financially. No deep-digging into a line of credit or any of that. 
This goes the same with a 529 for your kids (I have the benefit of transferring my GI Bill to them, so I haven’t started a 529 just yet), a consistent “misfire” on your withholdings you get billed with every April, or whatever else it is that you can plan to “probably” pay for.

Speaking of taxes and April 15th and all of that..
(I’m guilty of this one, and I am just this year finally going to have them adjusted- but ..) 
If you are getting a fat “tax refund” every year, do yourself the favor of adjusting your withholdings already. For simpler math, we’ll say the average tax refund last year was $2,400 (it was a little higher). That’s $200/month you (I) loaned out interest-free that could have been put to intentional use by funding an interest-bearing asset, paying down debt faster, or just enjoying an extra night out every couple weeks or so. That “bonus money” may seem like a windfall each year, but if you are managing your money with intent it is easy to realize how that additional monthly income could have been put to better use. 

Keep on learning. 
I constantly read on finance, markets, investments, savings, etc etc etc.. and in the years since I first began the habit, the role this plays in my approach to my own financial planning has changed dramatically. When I first started, I felt sure that since “nobody else was learning all this stuff” (ie, the everyday sailors I work(ed) with), I could gain a leg up and really pull in some money if I just played it right. 
Since then, I have kept on learning because it interests me and- more importantly- it keeps me humble. After learning much more than I knew before, I realize how much I do NOT (probably CAN NOT) know about this stuff. 
Suffice to say, there are countless white-collar sociopaths with Ivey League educations and 200 IQs drinking in more financial knowledge in a day than I could manage in a lifetime; even better, there’s things like [Aladdin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(BlackRock)) out there processing through more information than my puny mortal brain can even comprehend. All with the intent of “beating the market”- something that nearly NONE of them ever manage to do over any significant period of time. Simply stated, by continuing to learn about this stuff I learn that “the market” WILL beat you- not a matter of “if”, but “when”. 

As I keep reading and learning, I feel that I can stay sharp in my own little way; but more importantly, I’m reminded of how limited I am in those things like “beating the market” so can feel more comfortable and confident making the safer, more boring decisions that your average person invariably fares better with. 

Like I said, no major epiphanies; no revelations unto riches; none of that. Just safe and sound, BORING methodology drummed out yet again by another nobody- because it works."
