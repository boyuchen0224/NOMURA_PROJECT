&gt;Revenue hit $800 million in consumer spend in 110 days, and it hit $950 million by the end of 2016. Pokemon Go was No. 1 in downloads on iOS and Google Play in 2016, and it was No. 3 in revenue, behind No. 1 Monster Strike and No. 2 Clash Royale.

Quite good for AR game, which was driven on the wave of hype into the abyss of oblivion."
1,2017-03-23,AdamtoZ,0,Building a Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality portfolio,"Hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you clicked this I assume you are on the same mindset slightly about the future. Not looking for criticism on my decisions. Just looking for more businesses or side part manufacturers that I may not have thought of. There are infinite capabilities to this technology with huge potential growth. For those who have read the book ""Ready Player One"" you will know the very real capabilities this industry is aiming at. For those who don't, there is a movie coming out in 2018 I think...

I am pivoting my entire portfolio into a long term VR/AR focus. 

My portfolio so far includes: 
(keep in mind I am sticking to affordable stocks where gains could actually make a significant profit with a decent change in price)

* AMD - Very obvious leader in graphics cards next to their competitor NVDA (which is just too expensive to buy alot of)

* VUZI - To me I feel like they are going to be a top contender next to the big names for AR related to the healthcare industry.

* MSFT - Obvious but not sure how much this stock price will move long term.

* Considering FB and SONY because They currently have what I'd say is the most powerful VR advantage, even though they are expensive-ish.

* Really looking for stocks like WorldViz which isn't publicly traded. Companies involved in the virtual worlds development and education sectors development of VR/AR is going to be everything in the future. Every home will be involved and participating, just like the internet is used now.


I hope I didn't forget things I wanted to say."

I know the consensus here is overwhelmingly bearish on $SNAP but these new World Lenses are literally a gold mine for advertisers. It's one thing to have an ad pop up on your browser but what about a giant Taco Bell taco floating behind your best friend? That shit is hilarious and doesn't really bother anyone who uses Snapchat. Sure you can argue Facebook will just copy these features, but no one is posting stories on Facebook. It's actually pathetic. Instagram is a different story but I argue that cramming the app with a bunch of random features just to stay relevant with Snapchat will make it lose appeal over time. I think this company is cooking up some cool stuff in AR and wearable tech and we've only really seen the beginning of it.  "

6,2017-05-29,MartEden,0,How Microsoft Is Pursuing the Lane between VR and AR,"Mixed reality coming to challenge virtual reality
Microsoft (MSFT) has mostly kept its AR (augmented reality) headset, HoloLens, as a developer product. However, the tech giant is starting to reach out to the masses with a technology that delivers the HoloLens experience and more. However, its moves could rattle Facebook and Sony, who are trying to dominate the VR (virtual reality) market.

Microsoft is taking the MR (mixed reality) experience to the masses. MR sits somewhere between AR and VR in that it cuts you off from the physical world but allows you to interact with digital items like software."

9,2017-05-11,7506blasting,0,Snap is an awesome prospect with an inflated price,"I shorted Snap from 23.02 a couple of days ago, but I'm just waiting for a good entry point to go long. I'm seeing a lot of nonsense flying around about Snap now, and I wanted to put in my two cents.

First let me clarify a few things. The 'we may never achieve profitability' quote from their S-1 that people keep using as some warning of Snap's weakness is just a typical legal disclaimer found in all S-1. I don't know why people keep quoting it as if it's some unique insight.

Secondly, Snap's first earnings tanked - as did Facebook's, as did Twitter's, as did Tesla's, as do a lot of tech-oriented IPO's. It means virtually nothing long term. The point of an IPO is to raise cash, and a lot of companies go public with inflated prices to raise that cash, then take the hit for a few quarter's earnings.

The reason I'm investing in Snap myself (when they're at a fair price) is that they have THE best augmented reality software around. Hands down. For all that Facebook can copy stories, their filters are just stickers placed over the live camera view. Snap filters are applied to a 3d object (your head, usually) in 3d space. 

Their facial recognition is also precise and refined enough to alter features of your expression - in real time - and still look realistic. Even the most basic filters on the app widen the eyes a little, apply paling and contouring to the right spots, recognises open mouths and raised eyebrows. This is literally like live photoshopping a picture to make you attractive. If you want to know why girls in particular love this app, then this is it. 

Far bigger companies are still struggling to get instant iris recognition and facial focus right. The closest competitor to this is Microsoft's Hololens, a $1000+ product, and some inferior Chinese-market apps. While Facebook (who people keep saying are going to destroy snap) have settled on stickers.

Their augmented reality is now at a level where they can not only alter complex objects in real space, but they can even remove objects from 3d space. Here is a video of the company which Snap acquired early on, which shows how powerful a lot of this is.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjrLjS5kQ2k&amp;t=2s

I know the fact they're using this incredible technology for doggy filters and beautifying teenage girls makes it easy to dismiss them, but the tech alone makes them valuable. They're ahead of almost everyone in this regard, and if you can't see that AR is the next massive growth market then you may as well just invest in Facebook and treat it like a pension fund. The fact Zuckerberg is desperately altering the fundamental attractions of everything he owns because he's so afraid of Snap should be a warning to those skeptical of it, not those optimistic about it.

People are obsessing about the ad revenue, but I think Snap are still figuring out the best way to capitalise on their own innovations. It may not even be ads, it might be turning it into a service, or selling an actual product. I think this is smart. Google and Facebook have monopolised the ad market. It's not even worth competing.

Considering this is a company which brought a successful hardware product to market, it's not hard to imagine a future where Snap combine spectacles and their AR technology. Sure, they might use this powerful tech to do something silly, like create glasses which turn everyone you see into anime rabbit-girls in real-time, or make downtown Detroit look like the mushroom kingdom, but would you bet against those things selling like hotcakes? I'm not saying they will do that, just that the possibilities are kinda wild if you actually think about them.

Lastly, I just want to say I think a lot of people are overlooking Snap because it's a fashion brand, one that appeals to trendy teenage girls, and so must be trashy. Whereas AMD, a company which makes inferior chips to Intel and Nvidia, has a crap track record, a history of issues, crap technicals, ok-ish fundamentals, and minute market share, is somehow a great and promising investment (I love AMD, but I'm making a point). I see so many of the best stocks on the market go unnoticed simply because they involve fashion, or make-up, while stuff like graphics chips and gopros gather these absurd cult followings.

I'm hoping for a massive selloff down to sub-$17. If it hits anything like $13-14 I'm going in deep."
10,2017-06-29,shane_stockflare,9,stockAday: Is Amex Platinum? $AXP,"Yeap, Amex is coming up on 35 years in the Dow. Will the next 35 years be another 25x investment?

# Key Stats for American Express Company
|Ticker|[AXP](https://stockflare.com/stocks/axp)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Consumer Credit Cards Services
Latest price | $83.97
Value | $75,051M
Daily vol | $282M
Date | 29 June 2017
Links | [Financials](http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=axp&amp;type=10&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=include&amp;count=10), [americanexpress.com](https://www.americanexpress.com)

# 1. You know the brand, what about the company?

Amex's principal products and services are charge and credit card products, and travel-related services, which are offered to consumers and businesses around the world. 

They break the business into:

* U.S. Consumer Services, i.e. folks in the US with an Amex card
* International Consumer and Network Services = foreigners
* Global Commercial Services = businessmen
* Global Merchant Services, shops and businesses paying Amex a cut

Next let's look at the splits. 

|2016|Net Revenue|Income|Margin| No. of cards | Capital |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
US Consumers | $11.3bn | $2.5bn | 22%| 33m | $7.2bn |
International | $5.2bn | $0.7bn | 13%|  15m |$2.5bn |
Global Commercial | $9.2bn | $1.9bn | 21%|  14m |$7.0bn |
Merchant Services | $4.4bn | $1.5bn | 33%| n/a | $2.5bn |

So clearly the least exciting bit is international. What's wrong with ""American""! But maybe we shouldn't be so negative on the International unit, as to a large extent, Amex is outsourcing the international business with 150 partners do the card issuing to consumers and negotiations with shops in over 130 countries. i.e. they've only 15m Amex cards internationally but another 49m partner cards!

But overall the best margins and returns are from shops. It's no wonder lots of businesses refuse Amex.

## Bringing it all together:

The top line is flatlining at best. And although the bottom line is looking good, that's driven by buybacks, not by operational efficiency. In fact, one-off gains have boosted earnings a lot in each of the last 3 years.

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $31bn | $33bn | $34bn | $33bn | $32bn|
|EPS | $3.89 | $4.88 | $5.56 | $5.05 | $5.65|

Now, I'm all for capital coming back to shareholders, but I'd like to see some growth too. In the annual report they wrote:

&gt; In a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment, we remain focused on our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In 2016, revenue was lower year-over-year, though revenue performance sequentially improved in the fourth quarter. We made a record level of business-building investments during 2016 and continued to make progress on our plans to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base by the end of 2017. In addition, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Amex, please forgive me, but aren't you a mainly US business? Isn't the Great Recession nearly 7 years past?

# 2. Amex vs the rest

Visa and Mastercard really aren't fair comparisons, from a business model perspective, since they don't actually manage end consumers. They are more like the ""Merchant Services"" unit of Amex.. just 3 to 4 times bigger.

Maybe Paypal and Discovery ar worth a look, as they are brands in their own right, so on that front, we can probably cheer both margins and returns. 

|Operations|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
American Express Company | $32,517M | 25% | 24%
Visa Inc | $16,829M | 68% | 17%
Mastercard Inc | $11,064M | 57% | 75%
Paypal Holdings Inc | $11,273M | 21% | 10%
Discover Financial Services | $8,810M | 53% | 22%
Fiserv Inc | $5,568M | 35% | 35%
Alliance Data Systems Corporation | $7,341M | 24% | 28%
Global Payments Inc | $3,870M | 21% | 12%
Square Inc | $1,791M | 0% | -17%

But it's when we get to valuation that the difference come clear. AXP and DFS are expect to be single digit growers. And it's reflected in the price. 

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|
AXP | $75,051M | 15x | 8% | 2% |
V | $221,874M | 29x | 15% | 1% |
MA | $133,781M | 29x | 15% | 1% | 
PYPL.O | $65,336M | 31x | 17% | 0% | 
DFS | $23,526M | 10x | 9% | 2% | 
FISV.O | $26,348M | 24x | 12% | 0% | 
ADS | $14,621M | 14x | 12% | 1% | 
GPN | $14,010M | 23x | 18% | 0% | 
SQ | $9,091M | -128x | 20% | 0% | 

Perhaps the assumption is that the ""moats"" around V MA and PYPL are significantly deeper. And that Amex's brand just isn't that defensible long term. An assumption, I'd argue with!

# 3. What does Wall Street thinks?

Although Wall Street says _Buy_ it's hardly putting it's neck out with a $84 price target. i.e. no upside!

And at 15 times earnings, the stock's valuation has ramped to a two year high, all the way from just 9x earnings back in Feb 2016.

# 4. Clear your card?

When I read management transcripts, I don't get the impression that the Amex card is either in the soup or super. For example:

&gt; Step in back, over the past several years we have embarked on a serious of initiatives to reposition the company drive sustainable revenue growth. Those efforts which we covered in Investor Day, include, amongst others, focusing on further penetrating commercial payments by leveraging our small business and middle market assets on our global commercial segments, driving more organic growth through expanded engagement with existing customers, better leveraging our digital and big data capabilities for new customer acquisition and other targeting, growing our merchant network and pursuing lending expansion opportunities. These action for targeted to provide a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer-term.

It feels very ""pedestrian"". Sure, I'll get some cash back in divides and appreciation with buyback. But it's hard to get excited. 

The card may be Platinum, but not the stock.

12,2017-06-07,hfutrell,1,thoughts on recent AR/VR Apple announcements?,"1. Apple is now selling a VR development kit through their developer program. The $599 platform consists of a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) external GPU chasis, a AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU, and a $100 discount to purchase an HTC Vive VR headset.

2. MacOS High Sierra will support external GPUs, potentially making all current Macs VR capable at minimal cost. Nvidia has already released beta drivers for their GPUs that unlock this use case, and as I mentioned the development kit uses an AMD GPU.

3. Steam VR is coming to Mac

4. Apple has announced ARKit for iOS, an augmented reality framework to simplify development of augmented reality apps.

5. Apple has announced VisionKit for iOS, a computer vision framework that uses machine learning on-device. In developer sessions they demonstrated an augmented reality app that could label the dominant element in a scene in real time (""you're looking at a banana"", ""now you're looking at a microwave"", etc)

6. Apple has announced an update to its 3D graphics API, Metal, to support VR and external GPUs.

So what do we make of this? In particular I'm interested in the ramifications of external GPUs. Does the fact that Mac users will not need to buy a new machine to support VR make them a wider market than PCs? I am a Mac / iOS expert and professional developer, but I am not an expert on PCs or VR, so I'm interested in people's thoughts."
