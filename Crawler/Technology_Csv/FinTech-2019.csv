Not sure if this is against the rediquette of this sub or if it's been posted befoee, but I've started trading over the last few months and I'm getting hammered with fees (using IG), those in the UK obviously know we don't get robin hood.

I came across this fintech company which is basically replicating the benefits of robin hood for the uk and Europe markets.

Total outstanding U.S. consumer loans hit a new record last year, driven by digital-first lending options.

Financial technology, or fintech, companies now make up 38 percent of the personal loan market — up from just 5 percent five years ago, according to new data from TransUnion. Banks' market share is going the other direction.

""The rapid growth in consumer loans sits squarely on the shoulders of fintechs,"" says Jason Laky, senior vice president and leader of TransUnion's consumer lending line of business."

3,2019-02-13,hyousef333,1,"I've listened to hundreds of hours of earnings calls. Naturally, I have some thoughts on how to make them better. So here are my Thoughts on Earnings Calls","**Thoughts on Earnings Calls**

I can’t help but feel that earnings calls aren’t quite living up to their potential. I often get the sense that I am more excited for an earnings call than the management team is. I’ve talked with many earnings calls listeners and across the board what irks us all is when we sense that the CEO (or management team in general) was dragged into the conference room to talk on the earnings call. One could easily attribute this to the fact that this is just another earnings season formality and the CEO just wants to get it over with. But I don’t believe the issue is with the executives. I believe the issue is with the earnings call itself.

I love earnings calls because I get to listen to management teams talk about their company for an entire hour. As a podcast lover, I view a company’s earnings call as their quarterly podcast. I always get asked why I listen to an earnings call when I can just read the transcript and the truth is I enjoy listening to them because I get to pick up on tone and other aspects of speech. Among other things, I listen for the overall enthusiasm and confidence of the company’s executives. The same applies for the analysts and reporters on the call — I pay attention to what they have to say and how they say it.

If you’re unfamiliar with earnings calls, they start with the company’s prepared remarks. This is usually 25 minutes of the CEO and CFO reading off of a script. This is pretty straight forward — the script usually mirrors the press release that the company releases that same day. The call then transitions into the Q&amp;A section. The Q&amp;A section is what I’d like to focus on in this post.

A mix of analysts, reporters, and institutional investors join the call to ask their questions. These questions are typically technical in nature like when an analyst asks for clarification on a number they need for their financial model. These questions are usually valuable and relevant but only for the questioner. To be candid, this makes the earnings call boring for the rest of the listeners. Part of the problem I’ve identified is that there is no retail investor representation on earnings calls. Some companies, like some in the airline industry, have taken notice and are beginning to segment their Q&amp;A section into an analyst section and a media section.

I’d love for companies to take this one step further and include a Q&amp;A section for retail investors. If we’re talking about a consumer facing company, chances are the retail investor is also a loyal customer and perfectly qualified to ask quality questions. The question then is, why isn’t there retail investor representation on earnings calls?

I’ve spent many hours interviewing directors of investor relations and what I’ve learned is that companies don’t really know who owns them at any given moment. By the time the investor relations department gets the quarterly 13F report, it’s usually outdated. Ownership reports like the 13F focus on large shareholders so it makes perfect sense why investor relations departments don’t cater to retail investors. Retail investors don’t typically call the investor relations department for clarification on the company’s guidance forecast for the sake of updating their financial models. Analysts and institutional investors, however, are regularly reaching out to investor relations departments so it’s natural for the IR department to have them top of mind. The reason there is no retail investor representation on earnings calls is because investor relations departments don’t even know who they are! They know retail investors exist, obviously, but they don’t know who they are individually and don’t have a means to engage the retail investor cohort.

I believe earnings calls will be better served with retail investor representation. Questions from retail investors tend to be thoughtful, passionate, and relevant. Evidence for this can be seen looking at Tesla’s Q4 2018 earnings call where retail investors had an opportunity to submit questions that Elon Musk answered. This was made possible by fintech startup, [Say](http://say.com/). Say verifies that a person is a real shareholder then allows that person to submit a question. Submitted questions are then voted upon by other verified shareholders and the top questions get asked on the call. It’s brilliant. More investor relations departments should embrace these efforts. After Tesla’s earnings call, Elon Musk [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1090832580830785537) that the questions from retail investors were indeed thoughtful.

That brings me to another point — when executives sense that the questions being asked are thoughtful and relevant they will reciprocate that energy back with their answers. Energetic and thorough answers benefit the company because it makes the company sound engaged and it gives off a sense of confidence. Not to mention that over time, investor relations departments will learn what retail investors care about just like how they’ve learned what analysts and institutional investors care about. Retail investors would also benefit because their questions would be getting answered and they would feel more connected to the company they own a piece of.

There is a real opportunity here to make earnings calls more relevant, more exciting, and more informative for all shareholders. Small changes will go a long way here. There is a real opportunity to bridge the gap between shareholders of all kinds and investor relations departments.

I’m writing this because I care about the integrity of earnings calls. I’ve spent years working to make them easier to access and lately I’ve been thinking about the overlooked problem which is the earnings call itself. I believe that making earnings calls easier to access and more relevant will result in more people listening to them. With more people listening, companies will put more emphasis on earnings calls. I envision a world where earnings calls are a big event with large audiences and more of an impact but certain changes are needed.

With each passing week I’m learning more about the way investor relations departments work and what their challenges are because I really want to help them. I’m hoping this post can be the start of an engaging and productive discussion around this topic.

11,2019-06-02,Greyskullcountryclub,4,"GURU vs Titan, 12 month review","GURU and Titan both pick stocks based on top performing hedge funds. Which one is better? There’s only one way to find out. Last year I put $1000 into both GURU and Titan.

&amp;#x200B;

Titan is a roboadvisor app that will allocate your contributions amongst 20 stocks for you weighted equally. The 20 stocks are picked based on analysis of holdings from actual hedge funds. Analyzing public filings including 13F’s play a major role in determining what stocks are held.  They will apply a “short” position to the market depending on the results of your risk tolerance quiz. Seems like they are using Proshares Short S&amp;P500 (SH) for this.

&amp;#x200B;

All their marketing compares their services to the real hedge funds. You get the top picks, regular research digests, and inverse positions during downturns. All this makes Titan’s 1% advisory fee look like a bargain compared to the 2% fee plus 20% earnings fee that a real hedge fund would charge. Charging 1% is a lot, but it could be worth it if they can match their hypothetical 10 year returns of 12-14% annualized. If you like frequent communication on how each of the 20 corporations are performing, what moves they are making, and how the trade war is impacting business, then Titan is perfect for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Titan periodically swaps one stock for another, but keeps a cap on 20 stocks total. Here’s what my portfolio holds:

Disney (DIS), InterActive (IAC), Charter Communications (CHTR), Visa (V), Autodesk (ADSK), Mastercard (MA), Alphabet (GOOG), Credit Acceptance (CACC), PayPal (PYPL), PTC (PTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Transdigm (TDG), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Amazon (AMZN), Boeing (BA), Netflix (NFLX), Salesforce (CRM), Facebook (FB), Constellation (STZ).

&amp;#x200B;

GLB X FUNDS/GURU IX (GURU) is an ETF that runs a similar style of algorithm, analyzing the public hedge fund filings. The fee is 0.75%. It holds 60 stocks weighted equally.  The fee is less compared to Titan for a similar investment approach, but you don’t get the earnings call summaries, videos from the founder, ect. You can find what stocks are in the fund here: [https://www.globalxfunds.com/funds/guru/](https://www.globalxfunds.com/funds/guru/)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the values for the purchase date 5-22-18, the same day one year later 5-22-19, and a half way point 11-23-18. The chart compares the value of my Titan account, GURU value, GURU share price, and share price of SPY ETF.

&amp;#x200B;

||5/22/2018|11/23/2018|5/22/2019|

|GURU|$31.26|$29.59|$32.05|
|||\-5.30%|2.50%|
|SPY|$270.94|$263.25|$285.63|
|||\-2.80%|5.40%|

&amp;#x200B;

Titan earned 11% in value, GURU only gained 2.5%, while SPY gained 5.3%. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of those gains have evaporated as the market takes a giant deuce. Here are the values from the 5-22-18 to last Friday.  I’m at a rough break even with Titan, and GURU is down 1.7%. I expect the retraction to be temporary. BTFD

&amp;#x200B;

||5/22/2018|5/31/2019|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Titan|$1000|$998.53|
|||\-0.10%|
|GURU value|$1000.32|$983.36|
|GURU|$31.26|$30.73|
|||\-1.70%|
|SPY|$270.94|$275.27|
|||1.60%|

&amp;#x200B;

With the dip in the market, I’ve decided to add an additional $4k to Titan. I’m happy with the performance so far, and the interface is pretty slick. The regular digests make for good talking points that help me look like I’m on top of current events. When I first opened an account with Titan there was a promotion for zero fee on balances up to $1k, so no fee was deducted during the past year. My fee waiver is now expired, but a 1% fee will only cost me about $50 for the year. Not the end of the world. If I convince a friend to open an account, we both get our fees discounted by 0.25%. Four referrals earn me zero fee forever. I’m not going to publicly post my code here per the rules. If you have questions keep it out of the comments and DM me.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish Titan offered Turbotax integration. I almost threw my computer out the window adding the 1099 information manually. The forms were easy to download from Titan, but the interface in Turbotax to enter the numbers was utter garbage. I understand minimum viable product and everything, but I’m dumbfounded that a cutting edge fintech software company doesn’t have this. Apparently there was a way to do this with an Apex account that I didn’t learn about until after I filed.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as GURU is concerned, I’m not sold. It couldn’t keep up with SPY during the past year.  I know one year isn’t really long enough for a fair comparison. Comparing SPY to GURU since it launched June 2012, GURU gained 95% and SPY gained 99.9%. I can’t find a reason to justify owning GURU over SPY. There doesn’t seem to be a major advantage to how GURU picks its portfolio of 60 stocks. If you’re looking for something you can set and forget, there’s plenty of money to be made on index funds.

* Ideally it would give me a personal IBAN account number, so my client can pay me directly in NOK

* Being able to fund the account with a credit card without a fee would be a plus (for credit card points etc.)

Any ideas?

Some background in case you're wondering:

I'm a self-employed IT consultant and I'm currently working for a Norwegian customer via an agency in Estonia. I'm originally from Germany, but now traveling full-time.

Usually, my client (the agency) has simply paid me in EUR into my German bank account because it was easier, but now that NOK has devalued so much and I don't need the money immediately, I'd prefer to be paid in NOK. So that I can store/invest it and maybe exchange it to EUR/USD some time in the future when the exchange rate is better.

However, I don't really trust German banks because of the Euro crisis and I'd prefer to have my money elsewhere. I actually also have a Norwegian bank account from many years ago when I used to work there, but I'd prefer not to use that either as I'd like to avoid issues with the Norwegian tax office (""Why is there so much of our currency in your account when you don't live or work in Norway?!"").

I've thought about Swissquote, which seems to offer a multi-currency account, as well as the option to invest in ETFs/stocks. But they seem to have high fees.

Interactive Brokers is supposed to be very cheap, and they allegedly have even better asset protection. But their user interface is supposed to be difficult to use for beginners? And I guess they also don't have individual IBAN account numbers?

Saxo Bank looks very nice, but it seems a bit more expensive, too? On the plus side, they seem to support funding the account with European credit cards without a fee.

Revolut is great for cheap currency exchange (I use it all the time), but they have terrible support (they once froze all my money for over a week and you can only communicate with them through their app's chat feature) and I don't really trust them as they don't have a banking license yet."
18,2019-09-04,safeinvest542,1,Which are the best investment management apps,"Investments are an advantageous way to grow your wealth and secure your family's long term future. However, manually tracking these investments can be an arduous task. An [**investment tracker app**](https://www.investmentsafeguard.com/) makes things easier. 

To help you download one, we have listed a few apps that will smoothly track your investments. 

**1. Investment Safeguard**

Investment Safeguard is India's first of a kind fintech vault app, which aims to safeguard the investment details of its customers. This app also ensures the availability of a person's investment details to their loved ones, in case of an unforeseen mishap.

Let's look at some of the advantages of downloading the Investment Safeguard app - 

**a. Store all types of investment details**

You can store details from multiple investments on this app. If you buy the premium version of this app, you can store up to 18 investments. Thus, you will never fall short of space. 

Also, uploading details on this app is a hassle-free experience. You can either fill requisite rows or upload PDF/image file of your investments. Hence, you can produce these documents whenever and wherever needed. 

**b. Keeps your family in the loop**

One of the primary USPs of this app is that it keeps your family in the know. Let's take an example of your mediclaim. In case you meet with an accident, your family can pay or reimburse your hospital bills if they know about your mediclaim. However, the app also understands the privacy surrounding your investments, given the sensitivity of the information. 

Therefore, Investment Safeguard lets you give preference to the added family members. The app will verify their contact details, and you can customize the type of notifications your family receives. Thus, you will only share details that you are comfortable sharing. 

**c. Provides timely reminders**

After adding your investment details and family preferences, you will receive reminders from the app to make sure everything is fine on your end. You can also configure the type of reminders and the frequency at which you want to receive notifications. 

**d. Secured platform**

With modern security features encrypting investment apps, a third party can't access it. Therefore, it eliminates the risk of data hacking or data leak. Thus, your investment details in the app are safe and sound. 

**2. Moneycontrol** 

By downloading the Moneycontrol app, you can create a portfolio that will summarise all your stock market and mutual fund investments. The app will also update you with the latest value of your investments. 

The portfolio also lets you track your investments on the app. It will also suggest whether you should buy or sell your investments. The app also has an active forum wherein you discuss with fellow investors about investment ideas, the best time to buy or sell a share and other investment-related queries. 

**3. Tax Calculator India**

With the constant changes in taxation policies and increment in the number of taxes, computing your taxes has become a difficult task. Hence, you need an app that provides you with constant updates and helps you with tax planning. In that case, Tax Calculator India is the app for you. It gives you a better understanding of income tax and helps you in computing your taxes.

These are the various [**investment management apps**](https://www.investmentsafeguard.com/howitworks) you can download from the play store. Happy investing!"
