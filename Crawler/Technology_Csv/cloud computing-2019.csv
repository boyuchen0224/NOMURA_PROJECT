1,2019-01-04,vipnasty,1,A discussion on Berkshire Hathaway and Apple,"With AAPL taking a beating recently, I've been reading a lot of comments about how much money Berkshire Hathaway lost (unrealized losses) and whether Buffet made a mistake again investing outside of his area of expertise (tech stocks). 

Here are my thoughts on the matter that I hope will help existing/potential shareholders of AAPL and BRK.B (If you can afford BRK.A, you're ahead of the game than the rest of us).

* Generally speaking, don't do as Berkshire Hathaway does.
   * Even Buffet makes mistakes. 
   * Buffet might not be the one who made the stock purchase. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are former hedge fund managers who don't hesitate to make short term investments ([https://247wallst.com/energy-business/2016/02/29/warren-buffett-comes-clean-on-kinder-morgan-purchase-it-was-not-me/](https://247wallst.com/energy-business/2016/02/29/warren-buffett-comes-clean-on-kinder-morgan-purchase-it-was-not-me/)). If you buy and sell stock in companies based on what Berkshire Hathaway does, you'll likely buy at a higher price  and liquidate at a lower price than they did. 
   * Berkshire Hathaway has access to deals the average investor doesn't have access to ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/22/warren-buffett-bailed-out-a-bank-then-the-bank-bai.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/22/warren-buffett-bailed-out-a-bank-then-the-bank-bai.aspx)).
   * Berkshire Hathaway can afford to make mistakes or wait longer for their investment to generate returns because they are not heavily leveraged, don't pay dividends and have massive cash flows ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/brk.a/financials/cash-flow](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/brk.a/financials/cash-flow)). 

&amp;#x200B;

* Berkshire Hathaway will probably buy more shares of Apple at these depressed valuations. 
   * They wouldn't have invested over 50 billion in AAPL unless they are extremely confident in their investment thesis and have calculated the downside. Between Munger, Buffett, Combs and Weschler, you have decades of investment experience. I'll trust the billionaires who have generated market beating returns than random analysts.
   * Berkshire Hathaway places large bets on companies that they believe  is undervalued and they believe can continue generating cash in the long run.  
   * *In the first detailed explanation of Berkshire's investment thesis for Apple, Weschler says that the smartphone business had been transformed by the app economy and cloud computing. ""As network speed has gotten faster and faster, and with it the information that people can absorb on the network, things like photo applications, and apps, they create a stickier ecosystem"". Statistics showed that there was a high likelihood iPhone or iPad buyers would also purchase their next device from Apple, he added: ""****Once you are fully invested in the App ecosystem and you have got your thousands of photographs up in the cloud and you are used to the keystrokes and functionality and where everything is, you become a sticky consumer****.""* 

&amp;#x200B;

* For the individual AAPL shares are starting to look attractive. Now would be a good point to initialize a small position and dollar cost average as it goes lower. 
   * EV/EBITDA and forward PE are approximately 9.5 i.e shares are pretty cheap compared to other tech stocks.
   * Net Debt/EBITDA \~ 0.5 and interest coverage ratio \~23.5 i.e the company has a solid balance sheet and can easily cover interest payments. 
   * Operating margin \~ 26% and ROIC \~ 25% (almost twice that of the s&amp;p500) i.e AAPL is way more profitable than your average publicly traded large cap company.
   * The payout ratio is \~23%. i.e There is ample room for dividend growth because it is well covered by earnings. 
   * Over 64 billion in free cash flow last year, only 13 billion of which was paid in dividends. Seeing how the company doesn't have ton of debt, the rest will go into dividends and share buybacks.

All that being said, there's always a possibility that AAPL might turn out to be another IBM.  But having a strong balance sheet and generating massive cash flows minimizes downside risk and gives AAPL time to rethink its growth strategy. There's always risk in the stock market, but a key to generating long term returns is to minimize your downside risk. Also very important to keep in mind that you only invest money that you DO NOT have an immediate need for. 

Expect other stocks to take a beating at some point in the future when people realize there will be periods a company cannot keep growing revenues indefinitely. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I believe BRK.B is a more compelling buy than AAPL though. I get exposure to AAPL and a plethora of other stocks and businesses well entrenched in the American economy. Here is a slightly dated but still relevant slideshow of the true value of Berkshire [https://www.tilsonfunds.com/BRK.pdf](https://www.tilsonfunds.com/BRK.pdf)

BRK generally trades at a price to book value around 1.45. It is currently trading at a price to book value of 1.26. Add to that a conservative 5% growth in book value (Though Buffet has said they can manage higher than that) and share buybacks (they recently bought back shares at higher prices because they believed it to be undervalued), I expect annual returns of close to 20% for shares bought today when the shares trade at fair value again. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Buy Berkshire for a conservative portfolio. Consider buying AAPL if you're a more aggressive investor. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am long BRK.B"

Kraft is at an all-time low and Coke is struggling and hasn't beaten the market is a long time.  Then there's IBM, which keeps on posting declining revenue..  And also AAPL which is 22% off it's record high while the S&amp;P500 is only 2% off it's all-time high.

I heard he doesn't use a cell-phone, so he doesn't understand social media.  And I heard he doesn't use a computer, so he doesn't understand cloud computing.  Maybe this is a lesson in keeping up with the times?  Does anyone drink soda anymore with all that sugar?

What are your thoughts?"

A number of industry experts say Amazon is prepping to take on FedEx and UPS.

Amazon says its network is used only to move goods in-house to manage its quickly rising shipping costs.

But its network of ocean freight containers, trailers, fulfillment centers, cargo planes, and more is so large that not even Amazon could fill it, analysts say.

Amazon's moves in logistics lines up with how it launched Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud-computing solution, now the leader in a $176 billion market."

The argument from the street seems to be Microsoft is in overbought territory and is posed for a 10% or even 20% downturn in a years time because of its 28 forward multiple and the competitive landscape of the cloud. 

With Microsoft’s earnings coming up do any of you feel similar that Microsoft is currently premium and subject to a downtrend given how quickly and competitive cloud computing can be? I just don’t see any other cloud providers being able to bundle a service like office with azure and all the rest of Microsoft’s services and solutions.

&gt; Not since the dot-com boom have so many richly valued tech companies gone public in such short succession: Lyft and Pinterest are now trading shares, and soon Slack, WeWork and Palantir are expected to follow.
&gt;
&gt; But this crop of tech companies is markedly different from those that came up during the late 1990s.
&gt;
&gt; Many rode the rise of mobile connectivity and cloud computing in the last decade to multibillion-dollar valuations. They are more mature, having spent years as private companies building their businesses. But a number remain deeply unprofitable, and the time they spent in the private markets, increasing in size and value, has ultimately raised questions about where they go from here."
9,2019-05-09,EmmaWatsonsThirdHair,0,The case against Apple (yay!),"First off let's remember the last tech company Buffett bought up was IBM, and look how that turned out. So just because the Oracle of Omaha does something doesn't mean it's de facto correct.

Apple is not a tech company, Apple is a brand, and Tim Cook has said such when asked about Buffett and his investment in Apple. And to me the Apple brand sucks. AirPods are a $160 accessory which have a 1 to 2 year battery life. HomePod is an overpriced speaker with Siri, the worst AI out there. MacBooks don't have touch screens, let alone glitches in the new butterfly keyboards. iPads are severely limited in capabilities, even though they cost as much as a netbook. Apple Watch is as bulky as it is useless. iPhone is fine, but proportionate to the price there are better and more useful Android phones out there with the same if not better quality.

Apple's new services are a joke. Regardless of the fact that the actual services are underwhelming at best and useless at worst, why won't they come with an Apple product? Why do I have to pay Apple for their product so I can have the privilege of paying them even more for a service? It's ridiculous.

Speaking of ridiculous, Apple credit card. This product is so un innovative, so cash grabby, even the most ardent sheeple pause for a second before saying ""it has no fees and looks cool"" as if Apple is the only credit card with no fees /s

Tim Cook, and by extension Apple, are only concerned about their bottom line, and in tech that's the first sign of a company destined for mediocrity. Look at the latest innovations: Amazon Alexa, Uber, Doordash, Airbnb, Twitter, cloud computing, Oculus. Apple doesn't take risks, nor get involved in any meaningful way with the next big things. Let's remember Siri started out as an app on iPhone, caught Steve Jobs' attention, and was bought out and subsequently integrated in iPhone.

Market cap isn't really that meaningful, but for what it's worth Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are all closely tied and nearing a trillion dollar market cap. And regardless of Apple's supply chain in China and the current trade war and tariffs, I see Apple as a company unable to innovate on anything unless it strengthens their brand, Amazon as a company that's overextended and wildly overvalued, and Microsoft a company poised to become the cool brand to Apple. Google is an absolute mess of a company, and while they make great apps and software, they don't make the best hardware and don't seem interested in creating their own brick and mortar stores to go all in with regard to all their hardware devices, however they have a strong and consistent business model in creating Internet apps subsidized by advertising revenue in their core search product. And to me even that has more future potential than a status symbol and expendable wealth brand like Apple and Apple's products."
10,2019-05-04,EmmaWatsonsButt,29,Microsoft.,"Microsoft, imo, is still an undervalued stock, and I genuinely believe Buffett would be buying it had his relationship with Gates not be so close to create a conflict of interest. Microsoft is the fastest growing company in cloud computing, and they have the distinct advantage of not being Amazon, the player competing with everyone. 

Microsoft HoloLens, GitHub, LinkedIn, Surface lineup, Xbox, Minecraft, Office 360 subscriptions, even Windows, all of these are solid brands with real growth and impressive revenue streams. 

Satya Nadella is to Microsoft what Bob Iger is to Disney: a CEO so impressive, people are saying he has done as much if not more for the company than the founder. Nadella pivoted Microsoft into cloud computing years ago, later than Amazon but sooner than Google, and to me that shows a real vision for the company, ditching the name Microsoft Windows Azure for Microsoft Azure, not banking on the previous success of the Windows software. Satya Nadella also wrote off Nokia, which cost billions in the short term but would've been a wasteful quagmire trying to compete with Android and iOS.

Personally, I love my Surface Go, and my iPad felt like an iPhone with a bloated screen size. I think that while Apple goes mainstream, Microsoft will become the cool brand, especially with lines like Surface Studio. Office 365 has 155 million active users, and apps like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel continue to blow away the competition.

Microsoft is the best in b2b, and really good in b2c. My motivation to put my amateur analysis out there is because I find it disingenous for the second largest cloud computing company to be called a lacking innovator, as Scott Galloway claims as to why he doesn't include the company in his ""Big 4"" of disruptive tech companies. I also don't find it genuine that Microsoft is not lumped together with FAANG considering Microsoft has consistently outperformed every single company on there and is nearing a $1 trillion market cap. Plus that acronym was supposed to be about good tech companies to work for, and Amazon doesn't lavish their coders like Google and Facebook do, so that doesn't even make sense to begin with. 

Microsoft is legit, and with rapidly increasing business in cloud computing, virtual technology with HoloLens, as well as a legacy of staying in the top 10 most valuable companies for the past 30 years, I honestly predict Microsoft's best days are ahead of it. Not to mention the long term political implications of people voting with their wallets, and Microsoft fostering a brand of long term sustainability with a positive relationship in Seattle as well as not getting into the news for exploiting workers, data breaches, and other nefarious behavior."
11,2019-07-22,mateoverano,0,Amazon Price,"Just wondering what the view is of people buying Amazon stock.  I'm not saying they're wrong -- I'm no expert and haven't looked at the details of the company, and apparently real experts at Berkshire have been buying it.  It seems everyone knows Amazon now and they're nearing saturation of their market for ordering retail products online.  Analogously for their streaming services (so many competitors there too that could eat away at their share there).  I will concede that the market for cloud computing services could seemingly grow a lot in the coming years, and that Amazon may be poised to get a large chunk of that.  All together, I can fully see Amazon having a well above average P/E ratio, maybe nothing near 82.  What am I missing?"

""Oct 28 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 index was set to open at a record high on Monday as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal and rising bets on a rate cut by the Federal Reserve brightened investor sentiment.

The three main indexes could get a boost from Microsoft Corp , whose shares were up 2.6% in premarket trading after the technology giant won the Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud computing contract, beating Amazon.com Inc. Amazon shares slipped 0.7%.

At 8:49 a.m. ET, the S&amp;P 500 e-minis rose 0.36% to hit a record high of 3,031.25.

The benchmark index had come within striking distance of its all-time high on Friday after the United States said it was “close to finalizing” some parts of a trade agreement with China. The other two major indexes are more than 1% below their record levels.

Beijing confirmed on Saturday that “technical consultations” on some parts of the agreement were basically completed.

“Markets seem convinced the first deal will get done and that negotiations are progressing on the next deal,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

The news comes as a relief to investors who have been grappling with the fallout from the trade war and its impact on the global economy.

Dismal domestic economic indicators since the beginning of October have raised the odds for a quarter percentage point cut in U.S. borrowing costs to 94% from 49% last month.

13,2019-10-27,ChocolateTsar,2,"Trump told Mattis to 'screw Amazon' out of $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract, insider account claims","&gt;An upcoming book on James Mattis' tenure as secretary of Defense claims President Donald Trump told Mattis to ""screw Amazon"" out of a $10 billion cloud contract for the Pentagon.

&gt;The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, contract was awarded to Microsoft late Friday evening, sending shares of Microsoft stock up more than 3%.

&gt;Early in the process market leader Amazon was seen as the favorite, then President Trump said in July that he was looking into the contract after companies protested the bidding process.

&gt;In the summer of 2018, President Trump called Mattis and directed him to ""screw Amazon"" out of a chance to bid on the JEDI contract, according to the forthcoming book ""Holding The Line: Inside Trump's Pentagon with Secretary Mattis."" The account was written by Guy Snodgrass, who served as a speechwriter for Mattis.

&gt;""Relaying the story to us during Small Group, Mattis said, 'We're not going to do that. This will be done by the book, both legally and ethically,'"" Snodgrass writes. CNBC has reviewed the relevant passages of the book.

&gt;The Department of Defense and the White House could not be immediately reached for comment. Neither Amazon nor Microsoft were immediately available for comment on the president's alleged order.

&gt;The contract is capped at $10 billion over the next ten years. If it ends up being worth that much, it would likely be a bigger deal to Microsoft than it would have been to Amazon. Microsoft does not disclose Azure revenue in dollar figures but it's widely believed to have a smaller share of the market than Amazon, which received $9 billion in revenue from AWS in the third quarter.

&gt;""We're surprised about this conclusion,"" an AWS spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Friday, after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. ""AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion. We remain deeply committed to continuing to innovate for the new digital battlefield where security, efficiency, resiliency, and scalability of resources can be the difference between success and failure.""

&gt;Wedbush analyst Dan Ives called the deal a ""game changer"" for Microsoft, writing in a note to clients that the deal ""will have a ripple effect for the company's cloud business for years to come."" He also said that he expects Amazon to challenge the outcome in court, but for Microsoft to prevail.

&gt;Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been a constant source of frustration for the president. Bezos owns The Washington Post, which Trump regularly criticizes for its coverage of his administration. Trump also has gone after Amazon repeatedly on other fronts, such as claiming it does not pay its fair share of taxes and rips off the U.S. Post Office.

In the biggest-ever takeover in the luxury-goods industry, lvmh, a French global conglomerate, announced its acquisition of **Tiffany**, an American jeweller founded in 1837 and known for its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. lvmh is paying $16.9bn, more than the roughly $14.5bn that was suggested when the transaction was first mooted in late October. The deal represents a success for Bernard Arnault, lvmh’s boss and controlling shareholder, who had courted Tiffany for some time. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/lvmh-tests-the-limits-of-luxury).

## The magic trick

The flotation of **Alibaba’s** shares on the Hong Kong stockmarket raised $11.2bn, making it the most valuable share offering this year, ahead of the $8.1bn that Uber raked in at its ipo in May. The stock rose by 6.6% on the first day of trading in what is a secondary listing in Alibaba. Its shares are also listed in New York. See [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21775688).

**Uber** lost its licence to operate in London, again. The ride-hailing company has 45,000 drivers in the city, one of its biggest markets. London’s transport regulator raised more concerns about safety, including 14,000 fraudulent trips by unauthorised drivers. Uber is appealing against the decision and can continue to operate while it does so. See [article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/11/27/london-hits-uber-hard-and-hails-a-fleet-of-new-cheaper-apps).

The chief executive of **Westpac** resigned and the chairman said he would step down next year, as Australia’s second-largest bank faced mounting criticism about its response to a money-laundering scandal. A regulator has accused Westpac of failing to monitor more than 23m suspect transactions, some of which enabled child exploitation in the Philippines. The bank has found itself in politicians’ cross-hairs. Australia’s treasurer said it had been indifferent to the scandal; the attorney-general noted that it was an “unbelievably serious” matter. Westpac has reportedly cancelled its Christmas party.

**Charles Schwab**, America’s biggest discount broker, struck a $26bn deal to acquire **td** **Ameritrade**, a rival. The pair had recently been engaged in a price war, both ditching the transaction fees they charged customers. The combined group will have around $5trn in client assets. See [article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/11/30/charles-schwab-agrees-to-buy-td-ameritrade-for-26bn).

The **Brazilian real** fell to a new low against the dollar, after Brazil’s finance minister said he was “not worried” about a strong greenback. The slide prompted a brief intervention by the central bank to prop up the currency. The country’s current-account deficit has risen sharply this year, and interest rates have tumbled.

**Google** reportedly fired four employees who had been active in organising protests at the company and had apparently tried to gain access to private internal documents. The tech giant pioneered an office culture that mixes politics with work, which it may now regret. Vociferous staff have pressed management to drop an ai contract for the Pentagon and have walked out over sexual harassment and a search-engine project for the Chinese government. Their latest gripe is Google’s work for immigration enforcement. Google has told employees to tone it down and reduced staff meetings to one a month.

In an effort to boost profits and its feeble share price, **Telefónica** announced a plan to hive off its operations in Spanish-speaking Latin America and focus on its core markets in Spain, Brazil, Germany and Britain, where it brands itself as O2. The telecoms group also wants to expand its business in the internet of things and cloud computing.

On the lookout for new superdrugs that will replenish its portfolio, **Novartis** offered to buy **The Medicines Company** for $9.7bn. tmc’s crown jewel is inclisiran, a treatment that has been found to be highly effective in drug trials at reducing “bad” cholesterol, and which a patient needs to inject only twice a year. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/the-reinvention-of-novartis).

America’s Federal Aviation Administration said it alone would inspect the **737** max before it is returned to service, relieving Boeing of the exercise and signalling that it will sign off each jet individually. That could potentially extend the time frame that Boeing has in mind for resuming deliveries of the grounded aircraft to airlines.

**Tesla’s** share price struggled to recover from the drubbing it took after an unforeseen event at the launch of its new Cybertruck, which has been described as a cross between a futuristic car from “Blade Runner” and a SpongeBob SquarePants character. The vehicle’s supposedly armoured-glass windows shattered when a steel ball was hurled at them during a demonstration. “Maybe that was a little too hard,” said a startled Elon Musk, Tesla’s boss.
