You'll have to scroll down a bit for the video and it's a solid 90 minutes, but I really believe it's worth your time whether or not you want to be an investor. I don't personally invest in any crypto stuff, but I think the capabilities are fascinating and worth learning about. "
18,2017-08-22,101trajectory,1,Let's get a few things clear about cryptocurrencies.,"This is what you really need to know, juxtaposing BTC against USD. While they function differently, they are actually quite similar in their most significant requirement to succeed, value anchoring.

**Transactional Ease**

BTC is fundamentally a digital currency, whereas USD is a hybrid that allows physical cash exchanges. USD is easier to hold and transfer small amounts in person. Both BTC and USD can be transferred digitally, but BTC is faster for large international transfers.

**Unique Certification**

Unique certification is how a currency defends against duplication to avoid currency fraud. BTC has the blockchain, whereas USD has pattern minting for physical cash and rigorous laws/procedures for banks' digital accounts. BTC is weak against 51% attacks and vulnerable code. USD is weak against counterfeiting and bank fraud. 

**Supply Control**

BTC can be mined by solving progressively harder computational problems (capped at pre-defined limit, 21M). USD is printed and loaned out (generally unlimited). Money supply presents an interesting problem for BTC. If it gains mass non-speculative adoption, it faces the same challenge that USD underwent around economic growth and the need for a larger supply to maintain a healthy velocity of money. Though credit accounts help, we may see some novel indirect exchange technologies in the future. 

**Value Anchoring**

This is the most important principle behind how fiat-like currencies work. Like how US restaurants charge a fixed price for their food, US stores have an entrenched price system that ignores currency exchange rates. No matter what, $10 USD will get you a decent meal in many US areas. USD also has absolute demand in the form of government taxes and fees.

Bitcoin has no such value anchors. This is its most fundamental challenge. There is nothing to suggest a burger should cost 1 BTC or 0.1 BTC due to the vast majority of BTC acceptors using exchange-derived prices. There is no fundamental institution that demands BTC. Volatility is left unrestrained.

This marks the importance of backing a currency to establish entrenched-price value anchors before withdrawing the backing. Even those who adopt BTC solely to transfer money want stability. Hypothetically, consider what happens if the US government introduces a Cryptocurrency Stability Program that offers to buy any batches of 1K BTC for 1M USD. That's a unit price of $1000 per BTC. This program may cause BTC to plummet, but it will produce some stability and the insurgence of fixed BTC prices. This is one of the roads toward a successful cryptocurrency, though to the stable chagrin of wild speculators.

29,2017-10-18,sana128,0,"TOP STRATEGIST: Bitcoin will soar to $25,000 in 5 years","Tom Lee: I'm here with Sara to talk about why we believe bitcoin could reach $25,000 in 5 years.

Sara Silverstein: So you actually have a few research notes about this.

Lee: Yes.

Silverstein: And you’re — can you talk about your short-term model first. Where do you see bitcoin going and what valuation method are you using?

Lee: Yeah, in the short-term we think bitcoin has really followed very closely the idea of acting like a social network. Meaning the more engagement there is, the greater the value rises. And in the short-term, we think bitcoin will reach at least $6,000 by mid-2018.

Silverstein: And you’re using Metcalfe’s Law, can you explain that?

Lee: Yeah, so Metcalfe’s a professor. He actually came up with a theorem based on George Gilder, which is the value of a network is the square of the number of users. And so if you build a very simple model valuing bitcoin as the square function number of users times the average transaction value. 94% of the bitcoin moved over the past four years is explained by that equation.

Silverstein: Wow. Just to use an example, so this explains the network effect. Like one fax machine is worthless because there's nobody you can fax. But once all of your friends have fax machines, it becomes very valuable. So has this been effective in valuing things, in the past, that have a strong network but weren't producing any money?

Lee: Yeah, so three use cases — or businesses — where Metcalfe’s Law really explain the growth of the market value, is Facebook, Alibaba, and Google. And these are all examples where the number of users — like if you double the number of users, you're more than doubling the utility value. It's a little bit like the commercial in the 70s, you know, Prell. When you tell your friends, and they tell their friends, and so on.

Silverstein: And so your long-term valuation model — you’re looking at it — bitcoin, as a substitute for gold, as an alternative currency?

Lee: Yes, that’s right, and it's really — what we were trying to do is recognize that the creation of value in the future is in the digital world. I mean, all future great business are going to be digital. And with that concept, bitcoin represents a store of value because it's an encrypted — personal encrypted database, that for seven years hasn't been hacked. I mean, that is a way to store value. And if personal information is our gold, bitcoin is our digital gold. So we think that the gold market, which is 9 trillion, and for a generation of investors gold was their store of value. I think this next generation of young people view bitcoin as their store of value. And if it captures 5% of the gold market, it's worth at least $25,000 per unit.

Silverstein: And that’s the big number, that your — the $25,000 per unit hinges on the 5% of the money going into gold, going into bitcoin. So how do you come up with the 5%?

Lee: We explain this in our research. It's a very —  it's actually the most conservative collection of elements to get to the 5%. Because number one, we assume that gold only appreciates essentially a nominal GDP. So there's no inflation. And we assume that money supply grows at slower rates than it has historically. And then the 5% number, really reflects the assumption that investors will allocate in their blended portfolio only 5% to alternative currencies. Today, that allocation is much greater, it's closer to 10% or 15% in some portfolios. So, but at a 5% allocation that would value bitcoin at $25,000. You could easily get to $100,000, $200,000 numbers.

Silverstein: Is bitcoin special or is this just about all cryptocurrencies?

Lee: It's both. I mean, I think what’s unique is bitcoin is the dominant coin, or token, in a growing universe. I mean, there are 630 tokens out there now. But what we found in our research is that the more coins that are being issued, the more are using bitcoin as their master ledger, which means bitcoin's value is actually growing as there's more coins.

Silverstein: And you mentioned to me earlier that if some big investors get interested in bitcoin that the price could skyrocket really quickly?

Lee: Yeah, that’s right. It's — what's interesting is bitcoin is uncorrelated to other asset classes right now, and I think it really speaks to the fact that it's not institutionally held. It's really held by miners, and enthusiasts. Most of them are what they call hodlers. You know, they're not sellers of the coin. So the liquidity of bitcoin is deceptively small. So if you can imagine, you know, there was recently of a very well-known portfolio manager starting at a $500M hedge fund. If he employs typical leverage, he's buying $2.5B of bitcoin. There isn't $2.5B of bitcoin available to purchase. So I think you can easily see a liquidity-based move in bitcoin that's much beyond our target prices.

Silverstein: How much beyond?

Lee: Well that's getting into the realm of — nothing I would officially endorse — but, you know, when you think about liquidity spikes. Look what happened to oil. Remember oil went to $300 on a liquidity spike. So it probably would be easy to imagine that bitcoin could be $75,000 or something like that.

Silverstein: And can you help me understand what bitcoin is? Is it a currency? Is it an asset? Why do we compare it to gold? Like, why is that a fair comparison? And what is gold? Is it a commodity or a currency?

Lee: Yeah, it's a great question, because I think, as a primer someone has to finally accept what bitcoin represents. And what it is, is at the core, it is just a very well designed database. One that because of the way the encryption is built into it, is very hard to crack. So, unlike typical databases where the encryption key is held by central entity, bitcoin has this thing called miners and nodes. That each of the nodes keeps a copy of the database, and therefore you need 51% of the nodes to agree on a transaction to say it's valid, otherwise it'll say it's a spoof transaction. Which means that bigger the database grows, and the more miners there are, the harder it is to crack. So bitcoin is encryption, but the encryption strength grows as there's more miners. And today, it’s estimated that it would cost about $31B to create one fake coin.

Silverstein: Wow.

Lee: So it's easier to break into a central bank, like Swift in Nigeria, and steal $50M from there, than it is to try to get one fake bitcoin.

Silverstein: And do you think it's fair —  I know that it’s very hard to understand the valuation of something like a bitcoin. Do you think it's fair to look at the blockchain, that it represents, and say let's look at the value of this, and the bitcoin is what keeps us going, and keeps it secure, and so that's where the value comes from?

Lee: Yeah, actually, that’s a really important point. That by design —  bitcoin was designed to be what they call a fat protocol. Which means the protocol error, which is the encryption, is trying to reward users of it. And it's rewarded through paying miner fees. It's a little bit like — imagine if — remember Facebook's value is its users, but all of the upside in owning Facebook was the investors. Bitcoin said okay look let's reward Facebook users. That the more there are, the more money you get. That's how bitcoin’s designed.

Silverstein: And the more externalities you create by participating in Facebook, the more you'll get paid, basically?

Lee:  That's right and also, because of the nature of bitcoin, it means the applications that you build on top of it aren't as valuable. Because if you try to build a banking system on bitcoin — well it has better encryption than an application. So bitcoin itself will always have more value than the applications built for it.

Silverstein: So, this is 100 grams of gold, which at the time that I got it was worth about the same as a bitcoin. Which you think is a better store of value? Do you think that I should switch my bitcoins for gold or my gold for bitcoins?

Lee: There's a whole generation of young people — including my daughter who’s a CS major — that would say they don't understand why gold at all represents a store of value. And it's important to keep in mind, you know, for many years, gold’s price never even moved when it was – when the dollar was on the gold standard. So I would say I would easily change that for a bitcoin.

Silverstein: Great, and when gold started trading freely — you point out in one of your notes — that the volatility looked just like bitcoin, and then eventually it settled down?

Lee: That's right. You know, when people talk about bitcoin’s volatility today, they're forgetting that when we went off the dollar — the gold standard on the dollar, gold’s volatility for 4 years was about the same as bitcoin’s volatility today.

Silverstein: Great, thank you so much.

Lee: Yeah, thanks for having me.

34,2017-11-25,CzarNicholasThe2nd,3,Big Week for Marathon Patent Group ($MARA),"So I first stumbled across Marathon Patent Group ($MARA) in August when I was browsing a list of nanocap stocks looking for some prospects. At the time that I first saw it, it was trading at $0.26 (they have since done a 4-1 reverse split) for a market cap of about $8m - pretty much straight down from when it IPO'd in 2014.

I was interested in it because they seemed to have a decent portfolio of patents in various industries (automotive, batteries, biomedical, electronics, etc.). Looking back in their history I saw that they had won a case before against Oracle that paid them $35m so I figured there was some chance they could have a similar pay day again and, at the very least, $8m seemed to be modest price for their patent portfolio.

So I put it on my watch list and checked in on it a couple times a week. The earnings are always poor because they haven't won a case in quite a while. Fast forward to this month when they announced that they would be purchasing some type of blockchain company called Global Bit Ventures (11/02/17). 

This acquisition news initially didn't affect the stock price too much. Then this Wednesday (11/22/17) the stock popped a bit to over $2.00 which is about 100% increase in market cap since I started watching it. Then yesterday (11/24/17) it REALLY POPPED, closing at $5.95 - up 172% for the day. Plus after hours trading brought it all the way up to $7.00.

So at this point, $MARA has a market cap of about $54m which is up around 675% since I started watching it. I know this is a nanocap that most people have never heard of but I actually did see it go across the ticker on CNBC yesterday.

Basically, I just think this is an interesting company and that the giant pop was big name analysts - volume was 28x the 65 day average - trying to use it as a bitcoin/blockchain play considering the coming acquisition of Global Bit Ventures.

What do you think about it? Oh and I never bought it, still just watching trying to learn about micro/nano cap stocks."

Hive is still the first publicly traded cryptocurrency miner in Canada and has set records for trading volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). They are also a cash flow positive company, which is quite a rare thing considering how new they are. We must also consider the fact that they are poised for expansion in Sweden with a new state of the art data mining facility which is scheduled to be completed in March 2018. The new center will utilize custom-designed mining rigs built by Genesis. It should be noted that the center will be completed in 2 separate phases, of which phase 1 will be completed in December 2017. Each phase is expected to represent approximately 6.8 MW of electricity consumption for a total of 13.6 MW in Sweden. This dwarfs Hive’s current operating facilities which only represent 3.8 MW in electricity consumption. 

Hive itself has also not sold any of its mined crypto currency coins, and currently holds large quantities of Ethereum and ZCash. Why haven’t they sold any of mined cryptos? This is because according to Hive’s co-founder Oliver Roussy Newton, Hive has the adequate capital and doesn’t need to trade its crypto portfolio to finance itself. 


Thoughts on the future of the company?

EDIT : I was wrong that Hive has not sold any of its mined crypto, in order for it to be cash flow positive they must have sold just enough to cover expenses while saving the rest as investments. "

&gt;The original intended use of the blockchain was to power currencies like bitcoin — a way to store and exchange value much like any other currency. Visa and MasterCard were dinosaurs, everyone proclaimed, because there was now a costless, instant way to exchange value without the middleman taking a cut. A revolution in banking was just the start… governments, unable to issue currency by fiat anymore, would take a back seat as individual citizens transacted freely outside any national system.

&gt;The killer feature: knowing you can get your money back
It didn’t take long for that dream to fall apart. For one thing, there’s already a costless, instant way to exchange value without a middleman: cash.

&gt;...

&gt;Plus, it’s not actually that good a payment system — Visa can handle sixty thousand transactions per second, while Bitcoin historically taps out at seven. There are technical modifications going on to improve Bitcoin’s efficiency, but as a starting point, you have something that’s about 0.01% as good at clearing transactions. (And, worth noting, for those seven transactions a second Bitcoin is already estimated to use 35 times as much energy as Visa. If you brought Bitcoin’s transaction volume up to Visa’s it would be using as much electricity as the rest of the world put together.)

&gt;...

&gt;In terms of interbank payments, many people mention Ripple as a promising way to transfer money between banks. Over the last 30 days it processed two billion dollars (as of this writing) worth of interbank and interpersonal transactions — about 40 seconds’ worth of volume on the SWIFT interbank network — after three years of being available to banks to trade 90% of the world’s high-volume currencies.

""I think what viewers have to appreciate is, this is a millennial story,"" Fundstrat's Lee said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""The average millennial is 25 today. The boomers were 25 in 1982, so what did the boomers drive from 1982 to the peak population of the boomers, which was '99? The S&amp;P 500.""

""Millennials have great interest in digital businesses, social media and bitcoin,"" Lee said, adding that ""the millennial population is not going to peak until 2040.""

Lee was chief equity strategist at JPMorgan before co-founding Fundstrat in 2014. He is the only major strategist on Wall Street to issue price targets for bitcoin and expects the digital currency to hit $11,500 by the middle of next year and $25,000 by year 2022.

The S&amp;P 500 has climbed more than 18 percent this year to record highs, while bitcoin has surged 1,700 percent to above $17,000. Major exchanges such as Cboe and CME are vying to launch bitcoin derivatives products, which could allow institutional investors to buy into the cryptocurrency trend and pave the way for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

An October survey found 27 percent of millennials would prefer to invest in $1,000 of bitcoin versus the same amount of stocks. Harris Poll conducted the online survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults on behalf of cryptocurrency venture capital firm Blockchain Capital.

However, CNBC also reported in October that Vlad Tenev, the co-founder of stock trading app Robinhood, expects stocks to stay in favor. At the time, about 78 percent of Robinhood's more than 2 million customers fall into the so-called millennial category, those ages 18 to 35."

I'm kind of confused though. Who does the mining in a distributed ledger without coins? What is the incentive for someone to verify buys/sells? Who is trusted to verify buy/sells?"
