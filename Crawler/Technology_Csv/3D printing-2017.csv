1,2017-02-28,TheRealArcher,0,"Looking for ETF's specialised in new upcoming players for automation, robotics and AI. Important factor is that they are not filled with all the obvious choices that i can easily invest in myself.","Preferably not filled too much with TSLA AAPL GOOGL ...
I'm very interested in everything aquaponics, robotics such as boston dynamics, 3D printing, etc etc. But I lack the time to keep up."
2,2017-03-16,PM_ME_BOOBPIX,4,Any love for $ONVO?,"$ONVO I love their business:

&gt; Organovo is an early-stage medical laboratory and research company which designs and develops functional, three dimensional human tissue (also known as 3D bioprinting technology) for medical research and therapeutic applications. 

3D printing of organs? Who can't see how this is *HUGE*?  Really.
They have a product out there, they have sales, of course limited because they are dealing with distribution, regulation, and perfecting the tech.  A bog part of their business now is to sell to research facilities so that companies can do experiment with these 3D printed organs.

But the stock is not doing too well, it's a stock that I want to love, but there's no love there from Wall Street.

Anyone can make a strong case pro or con this one?"
3,2017-05-24,username_conformists,7,Long-term disruptive technology,"I spend a lot of time thinking about what could have been. What if I had invested in Amazon, Microsoft or Netflix when they IPO'd? 

I realized that I am thinking about this wrong and shouldn't be thinking about what could have been but what could be in the future. There is a lot of up and coming technology that people are talking about like self-driving cars, 3D printing, robotics, etc. 

What are your pie in the sky dream stocks that you are long-long term holding now to get in?

I've been looking a lot at 3D printing. It has the potential to completely disrupt a lot of industries and make a lot of money. There is an etf $PRNT as well as a few good players in the industry $PRLB and $DDD.

5,2017-06-18,mowza,3,Index Vs ETF,"I was just looking at a 3D printing ETF and it had a link to a 3D printing index fund.  I know that the ETF will be just represent some of the companies listed in the index where as all the index tries to track every company involved in 3D Printing.  What are the pros and cons of going index over ETF?  Thanks!

6,2017-06-17,butterflytutu,10,Star Trek Investing for the future,"So everyone knows that the tech shown in pretty much all the star trek series has already come to pass. The only things that haven't happened large scale are food replication, teleportation, individual space crafts, and holodecks. What we do have today that's close is 3D printing of food, and virtual reality. 

But from an investment standpoint, what companies would you be willing to invest in now that would be likely to make these possible to the average consumer in the future? I'm going to say the most likely things to invest in would be 3D printing and...what for virtual reality? Which companies are really on this right now and have the ability to sustain with public interest?

I want to get on something sooner rather than later before the prices shoot up like Google. "
7,2017-07-25,skipeaks,1,Stocks that Deal with AI/3D Printing,"I was wondering if anyone has stocks/companies that they follow that are investing in AI or solely AI based. Also looking into companies/stocks that deal with 3-D printing. 

Looking to create a watch to follow some of these. "
8,2017-12-26,bruzco,11,3d Printing,I recently read the piece Forbes did on a few 3d printing companies and was wondering what others thought about investment opportunities in these companies. It's an industry that could still revolutionize manufacturing and stock prices seem pretty low right now. 
9,2017-12-09,HarbourAce,0,Did a job for a friend and he wouldn't take no for an answer giving me $20. I don't want to spend it what are investment options.,"My friends is a super nice guy, I'm pretty in to 3d printing and he mentioned a phone stand. I designed and made him one with his name on it and all that fun stuff. He gave me 20 dollars for it, which I didn't want to take. I enjoy the work, design work is my passion of mine and he has as much right to that printer as I do (our school owns the printer). I don't need 20 dollars I just want to do something with the money, we have over a year and a half left until we graduate I was wondering if there was something I could do with it so on the day of graduation I could give him back something?

Thanks in advance."
