1. The world’s biggest privacy regulation GDPR goes into affect May 25 2018. 

If there is one thing that people know about the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) it’s that GDPR fines (administrative fines) can go up to 20 million Euros or 4 percent of annual global (note global!) turnover, whichever of both is highest. 
https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdpr/gdpr-fines-guidelines-application-penalties/ 

Figure this one out: Just shy of 100 percent of U.S.-based privacy professionals believe the importance and complexity of managing privacy in their organizations is increasing. 

Similar numbers (97 percent!) acknowledge they will increase their investment in managing privacy. Yet fully 61 percent of these same professionals acknowledge they have done little to prepare for the coming of the world’s biggest privacy regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. What’s more, 99 percent admit to needing additional help in preparing for the GDPR.

2. DATA443 (OTCPK: LDSR) ClassiDocs Wins Numerous Industry Awards – GDPR 100 days awayPress Release | 02/13/2018 

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. is pleased to announce that its recent acquisition – ClassiDocs - has won prestigious industry awards for GDPR Compliance, Data Classification and Governance in the 2018 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards. 

Gold Winner 

“This is validation for the whole team. The volume of support we received from the community surprised us but does match the feedback we get from clients and partners – that the ClassiDocs product set is an on-point technology that facilitates many requirements of the upcoming GDPR legislation and provides for a unique and feature-rich Data Classification and Governance solution,” stated Mr. Remillard, CEO of DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. today. 

“Congratulations to DATA443’s product team for being recognized as the gold winner in three categories: Data Classification and Data Governance. The GDPR category – a new one this year – had the ClassiDocs GDPREngine product place first also as a gold winner,” said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the 400,000-member Information Security Community on LinkedIn that organizes the awards program. ""With over 400 entries in more than 70 categories, the 2018 awards are highly competitive and all winners truly reflect the very best in today's cybersecurity industry."" 

“We have worked very hard on our GDPR functions – adding capabilities that are grounded in true use cases and deliver immediate value to the client. Our forthcoming GDPREngine technology delivered in a SaaS model delivers GDPR compliance capabilities faster and with much less total cost of ownership for clients,” added Mr. Remillard. “We will be making this officially available for beta clients in the coming month – the GDPR Deadline is fast approaching – 100 days exactly today. We are seeing increased demand worldwide for capabilities – matching our initial analysis that GDPR applies more broadly than just the European Union.” 

About Cybersecurity Insiders 
The Cybersecurity Excellence Awards are organized and managed by the team at Cybersecurity Insiders – the same group that manages the 400,000+ member information security technology professional LinkedIn group. The organization also produces numerous webinars and deep industry research for all facets of information security. It is headquartered in Maryland, US. 

About DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. 
DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (OTCPK:LDSR) (https://www.data443.com) is a technology company that is actively developing and acquiring cyber-security products &amp; service offerings that are central to blockchain, cyber data security, GDPR, compliance and governance capabilities. The Company develops its own technologies and has an active acquisitions program in place. 



3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR’s requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies – those with greater than $500 million in revenues – say they will hire a consulting firm. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html






4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe’s New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

“Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. “G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.” 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR – new rules, wider reach – the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the “most ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era” – and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

3,2018-03-05,lebronkahn,15,"Help: I am trying to evaluate companies from the angle of Cloud Computing. Can anyone from within the industry tell me which one out of AWS, Azure and GCP has a more promising future.","Thanks for your time in advance.

From what I read, it seems like a lot of companies are moving their network to the cloud. Apparently AWS has a huge leg up in the game, which is kind of surprising for me as I thought the IT companies should have begun doing this way before Amazon. And AWS is so important to Amazon that a lot of people here say that it's the number one reason to justify the utterly rich valuation of Amazon.

Apparently Microsoft and Google are playing catch-up hard. And it seems like Azure is closing in the distance from AWS. Is there any chance for Azure or GCP to challenge its dominance in the clouding market? I don't know about cloud enough to know if AWS has any immovable technological or pricing advantages. So if any of you who work with cloud can share some thoughts or information, I am all ears.

And if a company already set up their cloud network with one of these companies, is it easy for them to transfer to another company?

What bothers me is that I couldn't seem to find the exact revenue and earnings number of AWS and GCP on the 10K reports of Amazon and Google. Is it because they didn't specify it on their 10-K or am I just not looking hard enough? If the former one, where can I find their cloud revenue numbers?

Thanks guys."
4,2018-04-24,KingGinger,2,Thoughts/opinions on the cloud ETF $SKYY?,"Just curious if anyone has any opinion on this specific ETF, not the market/sector in general. 

I have been searching for an ETF that is not just Tech but more granular for the increase in cloud storage and computing coming to to the industry. This is the only ETF I have found in my search that fits my parameters, open to hear if there are any others you have found.  

I’ve never had experience with a First Trust ETF; has an expense ratio of 0.60% and a yield of 0.27% (so in my mind I am thinking of this as a 0.33% cost to own) 

Full profile here: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/skyy?p=skyy

Netflix being the largest holding is slightly confusing to me since that’s not who I thought would be in a cloud computing etf. Also can’t seem to find the 100% of holdings, only top 10/50%

Any insight or research material much appreciated.

5,2018-04-17,ElectronicGold,34,"Microsoft ($725.09 B) just surpassed Alphabet/Google ($724.96 B) and Amazon ($697.84 B) in market cap, and with augmented reality, cloud computing, and the Surface lineup, MSFT is a BUY","Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon are neck and neck these days when it comes to technology and market cap. Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&amp;J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel)."
6,2018-04-16,GloBoy54,83,WSJ: U.S. Is Examining Ways to Retaliate Against Chinese Restrictions on U.S. Tech Companies,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-is-examining-ways-to-retaliate-against-chinese-restrictions-on-u-s-tech-companies-1523910784

&gt; The U.S. is examining ways to retaliate against Beijing’s restrictions on U.S. providers of cloud computing and other high-tech services, effectively opening a new front on its trade offensive against China.

&gt; According to individuals familiar with the administration’s thinking, the U.S. trade representative’s office is putting together a fresh trade complaint, probably under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, arguing that the Beijing unfairly restricts U.S. trade in these high-tech services.

&gt; The trade representative has yet to decide whether to go ahead with the complaint, the individuals said, which would be in addition to recent moves to ratchet up pressure on China, including the imposition of tariffs on a total of $150 billion in Chinese imports. But USTR, which has taken the lead in the China trade fight, views China’s restrictions on cloud computing as providing a clear-cut example that might garner public support.

&gt; Beijing requires U.S. cloud-computing firms, such as  Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. to form joint operations with Chinese companies and license their technology to the Chinese partners. The USTR has said in reports on Chinese trade practices that Beijing withholds licenses that would allow U.S. firms to operate independently in China.

&gt; As a result, U.S. companies can’t market their cloud-computing services in China or sign up customers directly. Chinese firms, such as Alibaba Group Holding , by comparison, are allowed to operate in the U.S. without restriction.

&gt; “Some non-Chinese companies are reluctant to participate in China’s cloud market due to the number of restrictions,” said K.C. Swanson, director of global policy for the Telecommunications Industry Association. “Meanwhile the U.S. has no restrictions on foreign participation in our markets, it’s a clear-cut reciprocity issue.”

10,2018-06-07,pleg910,9,What’s your take on the current state of chips? Here’s mine.,"I’m just going to focus on popular reddit chip stocks because I think as a group they paint a pretty good picture of the landscape. Obviously between Micron, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel there’s been a huge rally in the past month, but the outlook since the beginning of June seems to have shifted. Here’s what I’ve gathered from reports:

**Intel** has by far the highest market cap and is the most established, but, especially after the AMD showing of 7nm chips yesterday, it’s facing serious competition and looks to be falling behind. That said, they’ve been “falling behind” for a while now and they still consistently blowout earnings. Like Apple, even when they aren’t executing perfectly, they’re such a mainstay that it doesn’t usually show much in quarterly results.

**Micron** suffered a hit from a couple analyst downgrades last week, and is under investigation. Any sign of a slowdown in dram prices will send it back to the 40s and I’m worried it’s just gonna keep bouncing off 60 and then dump with people taking profits before the earnings report in a couple weeks. Still, the majority of analysts like it a lot. Like...a lot a lot. 

**Nvidia** announced that it will be a while before new gaming chips are produced, but also they’re best positioned to benefit from AI and cloud computing. The stock is very expensive. 

**AMD** is undervalued, but their stock price is historically fickle and they just had a huge run-up. I wish I had some and feel that it’s too late to buy after today since I’m thinking short term (6 months-year). 

**All chip companies** are at risk of being used as a bartering tool in the USA/China tariff negotiations, which puts them in a potentially precarious position. This could be the reason Micron and others are under investigation by China (leverage). 

All in all, I’m scared and am considering decreasing my large position in Micron. If I had AMD I’d keep that one. I’m keeping Nvidia. I dumped Intel in favor of micron and Nvidia a couple weeks ago (a little late to the party) because they have more room to grow and I suspect intel’s technology falling behind will catch up with them soon.

What’s your take? I obsessively read reports, but I’m not in the industry or anything. I’d appreciate any info/opinions/advice you’d be willing to pass on. "
11,2018-07-24,zg311,2,FB vs MSFT,Whats a better value for the long term. I see FB driving up ad prices and I see a positive for MSFT with gaming and cloud computing. Whats a better buy long term 10+ years? Do you guys see any other good growth companies for the next 10 years with solid growth??
12,2018-07-22,EdTjhan15,0,Amazon taking over the world?,"Not really interested in investing, just wanted to ask some questions. I recently talked to my uncle and he made some claims that I want to verify.

He says that Amazon gets most of its profits from their cloud computing, AWS. He claims that AWS makes 44 percent profit from the entire cloud computing market (claims they are the most reliable and secure and most companies use AWS). He also claims that the US government will make a deal with them to store defense? data. Amazon will use this money to go into various markets such as banking, traveling, space, pharmacy, health insurance, etc and they will wipe out the competition. He says that they have already wiped out Zappos and Diaper.com or something by lowering their prices when Zappos matches them. 

Are all these claims he's making true or exaggerated? I can tell that he really likes Jeff Bezos talking about his background and ruthlessness in business."
13,2018-08-23,wirsteve,390,What's reddit's opinion of the next big thing in tech?,"Pretty obvious what it is now, ""Cloud Computing"". Companies have to ""move to the cloud"". Some companies don't even have directors of IT on staff, they just hire a consulting firm to move them to the ""cloud"" but they don't know what it is.

Let's say 5 years ago

* Everything was hosted locally or with an IT provider. Citrix for example was popular
* The number of apps in iOS app store and Play store have tripled - mobile is king
* Businesses slowly started to look at technology as a need and not as a luxury

Now 

* SaaS is king, hosting data in Azure, AWS or Google's data centers is popular
* Citrix is still used but in a different capacity
* You need a mobile app to pair with your website / company to be looked at seriously
* eCommerce has been changed dramatically with Square &amp; competitors

So what's next?

* Edge networking?
* A boom in security spending?
* Machine learning?
* Blockchain?
* VR &amp; AR?
* Internet of Things?
* Smart kitchens?
* 3D Printing?

We all know deep down, whatever the infrastructure is now, and whatever is popular now won't be in 2023. I'd love to hear what you guys think. Obviously my list isn't what you have to pick from. It's just some things that I think could potentially take off."
14,2018-08-09,etfrisk,6,Cloud Computing ETF,"Think Social Networks, Internet of Things, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, YouTube and Smartphone, and you realize that everyone of these enormous trends rely heavily on the ""cloud"".

Well there's a way to invest in the ""cloud"" and it probably a smart move. The $SKYY - First Trust Cloud Computing ETF has an incredible track record. This is probably the only pure play etf on cloud computing, and it has a seven year track record unlike any other.

The providers note that this fund offer exposures to the cloud computing space via a mix of pure-play, non pure play and Technology conglomerate cloud computing entities.

Presently the fund has AUM of $1.8 billion, and it's Expense Ratio is at 0.60%, and they've definitely earned their fees. Because since it inception, investors have had nothing short of a tremendous experience in this ETF. 

Here's a look at its performance to the end of July:

Year to date: 20.1%
1 Year:  34.71%
3 Years:  22.36% 
5 Years: 18.70%

Of course when you think of cloud computing, the first thing that comes to mind is Amazon Web Services (aws), and although the SKYY has 4.85% exposure to Amazon, they had managed to find other names that are active in the cloud computing space. The ETF currently has about 30 holdings, here are the top 10:

NETAPP INC 5.09%
AMAZON INC 4.85%
ALPHABET CL A 4.84%
EQUINIX INC 4.78%
SALESFORCE INC 4.73%
VMWARE INC 4.72%
OPEN TEXT CORP  4.70%
ORACLE CORP 4.40%
SAP SE 4.34%
F5 NETWORKS INC 4.33%

The cloud computing space had seen some serious growth over the last 5 years, currently estimated to be around  $180 billion worldwide, and expected to triple by 2021 to a market worth $554 billion worldwide.  

Definitely a space worth getting to know.

15,2018-09-14,yeetonem,9,Micron (MU) undervalued?,"I've been watching this rise of AMD. Reminds me a lot of the bitcoin run. With a PE of 110 and an EPS of 0.29, this AMD run seems purely speculation and momentum. Not necessarily negative, could be a lot of money to be made there... but I was late to the party so I'm staying away.

&amp;#x200B;

Micron on the other hand seems to have better financials. PE of 4.4 and EPS of 10. Compare to Intel (PE 16, EPS 2; NVDA PE 40, EPS 8)... Qualcomm losing money... I realize looking at PE and EPS is reducing financial fundamentals quite a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

But for their earnings, compared to earnings and stock price of competitors, micron seems wildly undervalued. The DRAM chips don't seem to be going anywhere... Especially with increasing demand for cloud computing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that potential oversupply of DRAM chips in the first half of 2019 is one of the major drivers of the price decline... But as a long term play, micron seems like a good buy to me. What do you all think?

&gt; Ad-renaline rush  
&gt; **Amazon’s ambitious drive into digital-advertising**  
&gt; *Building a big ad business will help the firm to keep expandin*g  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Print edition | Business
&gt; Oct 27th 2018 | SAN FRANCISCO
&gt; 
&gt; An award-winning series, “The Marvellous Mrs Maisel”, follows the fortunes of a woman in the 1950s who undergoes an unlikely transformation from a typical housewife of the day into a talented standup comedian. It is produced by Amazon and can be viewed on Prime Video, the e-commerce giant’s on-demand service. Since its birth in 1994, Amazon has starred in several dramatic metamorphoses of its own. It has pushed beyond retailing into fields as varied as electronic books, private-label goods and cloud computing, as well as online video. Now it is intent on becoming a force in digital advertising.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazon has a long way to go before it catches up with the giants of the industry. It has 4% of an American market worth $111bn, compared with Google’s 37% and Facebook’s 21% (see chart). But Amazon started experimenting with ads only six years ago, and its young business is growing fast in a rapidly expanding market. By the end of the year it will overtake Microsoft, a software giant, and Verizon, a big telecoms firm, to rank third in America, according to eMarketer, a research firm.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite trailing far behind the leaders, Amazon’s ads are having an outsize effect on the company itself. Its revenues from ad sales worldwide in 2018 could hit $8bn, contributing perhaps $3bn in operating profit—over a quarter of the total. Michael Olson of Piper Jaffray, a brokerage, says that by 2021, it is “highly likely” that profits from Amazon’s ad business will exceed those from its lucrative cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services. Amazon loses money on its core e-commerce business, but can use the fat profits from advertising in the same way as it has used the cash from cloud computing—to push into new businesses and countries, says Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20181027_WBC623.png  
&gt;
&gt; Closing the gap between Facebook and Google will be difficult but not impossible. Like those two, Amazon has a rich pool of data about users which it can use to aim its ads, including information about past purchases, which product reviews consumers have read, where they are and their online browsing behaviour. Amazon has a unique advantage, because consumers who are using the site usually intend to buy things right away. Some 56% of Americans start the search for any product on Amazon.
&gt; 
&gt; That will help it to grow as brands shift marketing dollars away from physical retailers. “Trade spending”—payments to retailers by makers of soap, mouthwash, canned food and other household basics for prime shelf space and promotional offers—adds up to around $200bn in America alone. Amazon is especially attractive to makers of such consumer packaged goods. Brand loyalty is weak and buyers are more likely to be swayed by prominent ads.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazon’s ads will not appeal to all businesses. Firms that do not sell goods through the site, such as fashion brands, carmakers and travel companies, will not advertise there. But online video is one potential opportunity to attract more business. Amazon allows video ads on Twitch, its online-gaming site, but it could also put adverts onto Amazon Prime to win some of the advertising spending aimed at conventional television channels.
&gt; 
&gt; Allowing advertising on Alexa, its voice-assistant, and Echo, its smart speakers, is another possibility. In the future, when people ask questions of Alexa or order something by voice, Amazon could incorporate advertising. Earlier this year it was reported that Amazon was in discussions with Procter &amp; Gamble and Clorox about voice ads for their wares.
&gt; 
&gt; As it chases growth, Amazon will face three obstacles. First, it must consider whether its advertising will put off customers. Voice ads butting in to conversations, even ones with inanimate objects such as smart speakers, are potentially irritating. And subscribers who have paid to watch online videos are unlikely to enjoy sitting through commercial breaks. Amazon must take care to avoid alienating the people it spends so much trying to please.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, Amazon will have to balance its relationship with vendors and address potential conflicts of interest. Advertisers can buy space at the top of product searches or pay to sponsor products. In addition, some search results are labelled “Amazon’s choice”, which favour important vendors and advertisers, says Matti Littunen of Enders Analysis, a research firm. (Amazon does not disclose how products get this designation.) And as Amazon becomes a manufacturer and seller of more of its own private-label items, it will have to decide how much prominence to give paying advertisers and how much to its own goods.
&gt; 
&gt; According to research by rbc Capital, an investment bank, of 100 product searches on Amazon’s app, in only three instances was the top ranking result not a sponsored ad. Those were for three Amazon devices: two smart speakers and a Kindle e-reader. Makers of competing products will be unhappy if it appears that Amazon is favouring its own products on its site or discouraging competition by driving up the cost of ad space on products that directly challenge its private-label goods.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazon will also have to contend with a more active regulatory environment. In September the European Commission announced a probe into its use of data and whether it could use information about third-party retailers on its site, which are also competitors, to boost its profits. As the inquiry progresses, advertising practices could become an area of interest.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazon has so far avoided a privacy backlash from customers. “Facebook uses your personal life and friend graph to target ads. Amazon has a more clearly commercial relationship” with users, says Jonathan Nelson, the head of digital at Omnicom, a large advertising agency. But as its ad business grows, so will scrutiny. Amazon gives users little control over how much information they share for advertising purposes, which could violate new data-collection and privacy rules in Europe, says Mr Littunen.
&gt; 
&gt; As it gathers more information about people in the physical world, including their spending habits at Whole Foods, the grocer it bought last year for $13.7bn, its dossier of data on consumers will become larger and more personal. That will propel Amazon’s rise. Just as Mrs Maisel discovers she has a new talent for cracking jokes, Amazon has a chance to thrive in a new venture. Before long it could make the digital-ad duopoly a three-way affair.

17,2018-10-28,NEO-ETH-Domination,1,IBM to acquire software company Red Hat for $34 billion,"Here is the link to the article: https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKCN1N20N3

Bumped into this post on r/InvestmentClub


Below is a quick copy/paste of the article:


(Reuters) - IBM Corp said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire U.S. software company Red Hat Inc for $34 billion, including debt, as it seeks to diversify its technology hardware and consulting business into higher-margin products and services.

The transaction is by far IBM's biggest acquisition. It underscores IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty's efforts to expand the company's subscription-based software offerings, as it faces slowing software sales and waning demand for mainframe servers.

IBM, which has a market capitalization of $114 billion, will pay $190 per share in cash for Red Hat, a 63 percent premium to Friday's closing share price.

Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software, which was developed as an alternative to proprietary software made by Microsoft Corp.

Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Red Hat charges fees to its corporate customers for custom features, maintenance and technical support, offering IBM a lucrative source of subscription revenue.

Red Hat is one of the very few companies in the cloud computing sector that has both revenue growth and free cash flow, Rometty, who has been IBM's CEO since 2012, said in an interview with Reuters.

""This acquisition we are clearly doing for growth synergies. This is not about cost synergies at all,"" Rometty said in the interview.

The acquisition illustrates how older technology companies are turning to dealmaking to gain scale and fend off competition, especially in cloud computing, where customers using enterprise software are seeking to save money by consolidating their vendor relationships.


IBM is hoping the deal will help it catch up with Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and Microsoft in the rapidly growing cloud business. IBM shares have lost almost a third of their value in the past five years, while Red Hat shares are up 170 percent over the same period.


BIG BLUE

IBM was founded in 1911 and is known in the technology industry as Big Blue, a reference to its once ubiquitous blue computers. It has faced years of revenue declines, as it transitions its legacy computer maker business into new technology products and services. Its recent initiatives have included artificial intelligence and business lines around Watson, named after the supercomputer it developed.

To be sure, IBM is no stranger to acquisitions. It acquired cloud infrastructure provider Softlayer in 2013 for $2 billion, and the Weather Channel's data assets for more than $2 billion in 2015. It also acquired Canadian business software maker Cognos in 2008 for $5 billion.

Other big technology companies have also recently sought to reinvent themselves through acquisitions. Microsoft this year acquired open source software platform GitHub for $7.5 billion; chip maker Broadcom Inc agreed to acquire software maker CA Inc for nearly $19 billion; and Adobe Inc agreed to acquire marketing software maker Marketo for $5 billion.

One of IBM's main competitors, Dell Technologies Inc, made a big bet on software and cloud computing two years ago, when it acquired data storage company EMC for $67 billion. As part of that deal, Dell inherited an 82 percent stake in virtualization software company VMware Inc.

The deal between IBM and Red Hat is expected to close in the second half of 2019. IBM said it planned to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021 to help pay for the deal.


IBM said Red Hat would continue to be led by Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst and Red Hat's current management team. It intends to maintain Red Hat's headquarters, facilities, brands and practices.

Lazard Ltd offered financial advice to IBM, alongside Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, which also provided financing for the deal. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP provided legal advice to IBM.

Guggenheim Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley were financial advisers to Red Hat, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP offered legal advice to the company on the deal.

""Knowing first-hand how important open, hybrid cloud technologies are to helping businesses unlock value, we see the power of bringing these two companies together, and are honored to advise IBM and commit financing for this transaction,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.

18,2018-10-02,ButMyNips,1,"Mark my words: Amazon will crash, and it’ll crash hard","“Amazon is a miracle, and we don’t invest in miracles.” -Warren Buffett

&amp;#x200B;

For those who need a refresher, the P/E ratio is short for “price over earnings ratio” and it is effectively how much of a premium an investor is willing to pay to buy stock in said company. Therefore, the lower the P/E ratio the better it is for the investor as you are paying less of a premium. Here’s a list of current P/E ratios for tech companies:

&amp;#x200B;

Apple: 19.9

&amp;#x200B;

Microsoft: 29.62

&amp;#x200B;

Alphabet (Google): 32.47

&amp;#x200B;

And here’s a list of other competitors P/E ratios:

&amp;#x200B;

Wal-Mart (retail competition): 57.07

&amp;#x200B;

Netflix (content producer competes with Prime Video): 158.87

&amp;#x200B;

Trader Joe’s (competes with Whole Foods): privately held, unknown

&amp;#x200B;

Target: 17.49

&amp;#x200B;

And now we have Amazon’s P/E ratio. The indicator of how much of a premium investors are willing to pay. As was shown above, most P/E ratios are between Apple’s 19.9 and Google’s 32.47, with Wal-Mart’s being higher at 57.07 and Netflix’s being off the charts as an outlier at 158.87.

&amp;#x200B;

But what about Amazon’s P/E ratio. Well now that we’ve established the norm, here’s Amazon’s P/E ratio:

&amp;#x200B;

180.02

&amp;#x200B;

This is a company that never makes a profit or makes a minimal profit at best, a company that has public opinion swaying against them, a company that dethroned Tesla as the #1 most shorted stock, a company whose CEO is becoming the symbol of greed when he’s the richest man in modern history because his workers are forced to pee in bottles in order to make production times or they’re fired. I’m not trying to make a political point here, I’m trying to make the point that Amazon‘s fundamentals are weak, it’s brand is suffering, and they are not innovating enough to justify such a cartoonishly absurd P/E ratio. Like if you had a trillion dollars, would you rather own the entirety of Apple, or the entirety of Amazon. I think we’d all rather have Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

Amazon is making enemies in every direction and setting itself up for long term failure. Amazon alienated Wal-Mart so they signed a 5 year cloud computing agreement with Microsoft. Amazon alienated Google when they pulled Nest which competed with Amazon’s own Ring, so Google blocked YouTube access to Fire TV. Amazon alienated Whole Foods workers who are aggressively pushing to unionize. Amazon alienated the citizens of Seattle by pressuring the city council to overturn a head tax which would have cost Amazon but would’ve addressed the issue of homelessness in the city. On an on and on the list goes of Amazon alienating everyone in order to increase its bottom line.

&amp;#x200B;

And let’s not forget Amazon has failed before. Amazon Fire Phone was a total flop. 

&amp;#x200B;

So while Amazon may be making the headlines today with their $15/hr minimum wage, the fact of the matter is Amazon hired these creepy Ambassadors to astroturf on Twitter, they constantly monitor Reddit with shills commenting “well other companies are doing it too“ and forcing stupid memes like “this is so sad alexa play despacito” and creating these band-aid solutions which don’t address the real issues and concerns at play.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not an investor in any company above and I’m not shorting Amazon. But if something’s bound to fail it will, and Amazon is certainly bound to fail."
19,2018-11-12,AmazonAmbassador,1,"As it is nearing the end of 2018, let's look at how big name tech stocks did this year","If you bought these tech stocks on Tuesday Jan 2 2018 and sold them today Monday Nov 12 2018, here'd be your outcome:

Amazon: 1,189.01 to 1712.43, up 523.42 USD

Microsoft: 85.95 to 109.57, up 23.62 USD (326.75 USD if bought 1,189.01 USD of MSFT at 85.95 USD)

Apple: 172.26 to 204.47, up 32.21 USD (222.32 USD if bought 1,189.01 USD of AAPL at 172.26 USD)

Alphabet A: 1,073.21 to 1,077.02, up 3.891 USD

Facebook: 181.42 to 144.96, down 36.46 USD

While the year still has about 6 weeks left, the clear winners are Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, in that order. Google flatlined for the year and Facebook lost value. While I do not have a stake in any of these stocks, I'd watch out for April 2019 when the Pentagon announces who will receive the JEDI contract, a long term deal to shift the Pentagon to cloud computing, and it's between Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's Web Services. Critics say Bezos declaring the DC area as the area where Amazon is going to expand with 25,000 new jobs was his ""boss move"". The JEDI contract is huge, because not is it only a $10 billion government contract, it also gives a huge advantage to that company for future government contracts. Google is not in the bidding if you're wondering because of an internal politics with their coders not wanting to build technology for military.

While everyone focuses on Amazon, and rightly so because they definitely were the clear winner of 2018, Microsoft made huge gains and rapid growth, and personally, I feel that Microsoft has once again proven that they can continue to be the 800 lb gorilla in the tech industry. Apple also gained significantly, but the fact that they will no longer publish total number of units sold for iPhones and other Apple items, as well as tech reviewers turning on Apple for charging more year after year while providing less, means Apple's time in the sun may be limited. 

Google needs to get its internal politics together, they flatlined for the entire year and flatlining is bad. I think that they're at a severe disadvantage selling their own hardware without their own flagship stores where they can control the shopping experience and gain user data, and clearly setting up their own brick and mortar stores has worked for Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. 

Facebook is one of those companies I'd throw in the towel. Zuckerberg was able to buy the future for $1 billion to acquire Instagram and $19 billion to acquire WhatsApp, but Facebook's reputation has been dragged through the mud so hard, the next generation of cool and hip social media will most likely not sell to Zuckerberg for any price because they don't want to be associated. Facebook is a social network where Baby Boomers have it as their default, Millenials have either left it or cling on for the nostalgia back when it was cool in 2010, and Generation Z hasn't even joined it once, opting for Facebook-owned Instagram and Google-owned YouTube.

In summary, Amazon under Bezos will most likely do fine in the future, Microsoft will continue to flourish, Google is a tossup because it's totally up to them whether or not they get their internal affairs in order and take retail seriously if they're going to sell their own hardware, Apple's strategy for short term profit at the cost of alienating people will mean it'll do well in the next few years but after that people will either mitigate how much Apple products they buy, or straight up buy their tech from some other company, and Facebook is a total sell."

US stock markets fell on Friday, as [more new jobs](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=9c9b604ede&amp;e=48f47ffceb) were added than predicted in October and the US said it [wasn’t as close](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=f06027c141&amp;e=48f47ffceb) to a trade deal with China as was [previously suggested](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=45ea2d02b2&amp;e=48f47ffceb).

**What Does This Mean?**

Better-than-expected job figures and [rising wages](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=52ee93e958&amp;e=48f47ffceb) point to an economy going from strength to strength, following third-quarter growth that was [surprisingly high](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=b20360d7f3&amp;e=48f47ffceb) – but could also mean higher [interest rates](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=5969c9655e&amp;e=48f47ffceb) to come, slowing down future economic growth ([tweet this](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=b01f3a80cf&amp;e=48f47ffceb)).   


Trade negotiations between the US and China have been long and [largely fruitless](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=09983c35a9&amp;e=48f47ffceb). The US introduced [import](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=a48acd18c5&amp;e=48f47ffceb) taxes (a.k.a. [tariffs](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=8c9356e92c&amp;e=48f47ffceb)) on Chinese goods earlier this year in an attempt to even out its “trade deficit” – last year, the US spent [$376 billion](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=20e956d76f&amp;e=48f47ffceb) more on Chinese products than China did on American stuff – and [several rounds](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=159ca149e9&amp;e=48f47ffceb) of counter-tariffs followed. In what might be a show of good faith, China appeared [happy to acquiesce](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=0ccb5c8a2c&amp;e=48f47ffceb) to new US sanctions on Iran – but the US [hasn’t done much](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=6cd76ab88f&amp;e=48f47ffceb) in response.

**Why Should I Care?**

For you personally: Hold onto your cash – you may need it.   
In the absence of a deal, the US is planning to raise existing tariffs on [$200 billion](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=5a8ad5fd7b&amp;e=48f47ffceb) of products from 10% to 25% – and is sizing up new tariffs on the rest of the country’s Chinese imports, worth [$257 billion](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=bae41a3d94&amp;e=48f47ffceb). Products bought directly by consumers have – for the most part – [been protected](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=c18965bbbe&amp;e=48f47ffceb) from previous rounds of tariffs. But that may now change, and the prices of some of America’s favorite Chinese-origin products, from playing cards to [kids’ tricycles](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=4131ee89d9&amp;e=48f47ffceb), will probably rise.   


***For markets:*** *Cool heads may prevail.*   
When it’s more expensive to import items, companies face lower [profits](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=7abe6feda8&amp;e=48f47ffceb) – or fewer [sales](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=7154c2e021&amp;e=48f47ffceb) if they raise prices and put off customers. Last quarter, [Caterpillar](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=8fce7a496e&amp;e=48f47ffceb) and [UPS](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=253d05cc46&amp;e=48f47ffceb) – bellwethers of the US economy – complained tariffs were pushing up their costs and [disrupting their customers](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=81216b8059&amp;e=48f47ffceb), making sales harder to come by. Any trade deal should, therefore, be positive for stocks.

# 2) Alibaba’s Arabian Night

**What’s Going On Here?**

On Friday, [Alibaba](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=171b53c5a7&amp;e=48f47ffceb) – China’s $400 billion answer to [Amazon](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=b6392a6e22&amp;e=48f47ffceb) – copycatted [some other](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=ef4965a939&amp;e=48f47ffceb) tech giants: it delivered a [higher-than-expected](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=52f5b5143d&amp;e=48f47ffceb) quarterly profit but a lower-than-expected sales forecast.

**What Does This Mean?**

Alibaba grew its [revenue](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=d6b611dde3&amp;e=48f47ffceb) by [54% more](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=fd2eff3a62&amp;e=48f47ffceb) than the same time last year, which was below forecasts, but [profit](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=4aa8924e77&amp;e=48f47ffceb) growth of 13% was higher than investors’ predictions. Cloud computing was a big deal – quarterly revenue from up there [almost doubled](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=dd057ab8ba&amp;e=48f47ffceb) compared to last year.   


But [forty thieves](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=1877872203&amp;e=48f47ffceb) stole from Alibaba’s annual sales forecast: the company lowered its expectations for the year by 5%, blaming China’s [uncertain economy](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=ec44ccb5d5&amp;e=48f47ffceb) (brought on by its US trade tussles) making it harder for the company to [charge the fees](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=303ff18e7c&amp;e=48f47ffceb) it wants.

**Why Should I Care?**

For markets: With great potential comes great competition.   
Alibaba’s got over [600 million](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=8516df27a5&amp;e=48f47ffceb) customers and believes that’s just the beginning. The Chinese [middle class](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=689ab66a29&amp;e=48f47ffceb) is expected to grow to [850 million](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=e3af9cc0c6&amp;e=48f47ffceb) people by 2030 (from 300 million today) – so Alibaba’s hoping to pick up much more yuan in services ranging from e-commerce to food delivery. But a growing population attracts competition: from [Meituan Dianping](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=506e95c6e1&amp;e=48f47ffceb) in food to the Chinese [government’s banks](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=8b80177e83&amp;e=48f47ffceb) (up against Alibaba’s aptly named [Alipay](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=fa1903e3d1&amp;e=48f47ffceb)). Investors might worry that any slowdown ahead on Alibaba’s front might benefit its rivals, perhaps leading them to sell off the company’s shares – they fell by 2%.   


***The bigger picture:*** *Meet the Chinese tech company,* [*same as*](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=2e6eb2956a&amp;e=48f47ffceb) *the American tech company.*   
Amazon and [Apple](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=05c01f0e67&amp;e=48f47ffceb), for example, have gotten used to bumper revenues from [Black Friday](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=e5d534b373&amp;e=48f47ffceb) and [Cyber Monday](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=7b8d1fa1d2&amp;e=48f47ffceb) (discounted sales periods in the US that have [gone global](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=2a7574a4d9&amp;e=48f47ffceb)). In China, November’s sales festival is [Singles’ Day](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=04139f754e&amp;e=48f47ffceb) – which, last year, pulled in [$25 billion](https://finimize.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=fd92d4d6912bf051aceebbc27&amp;id=6110e816ea&amp;e=48f47ffceb) for Alibaba. Given its lower sales forecast, the day could make or break Alibaba’s year – so its stock price might move markedly on any news related to the US-China trade war/negotiations (take your pick 😉) since it might have an effect on customers’ willingness to splurge.
