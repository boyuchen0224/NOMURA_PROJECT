1,2018-03-03,InterestingNews1,0,HP Inc looks like a bargain with 30% upside,"HP Enterprises was meant to be the star of the HP split

But it is HP Inc (HPQ) that has shone brightest as revenues and profits  increased strongly

Recently reported Q1 results saw revenues up 15% driven by strong demand for ultrapremium notebooks.  But the deskbook is also performing strongly and opportunities in 3D printing growing.

The stock is trading on a forward PE of 12.2 times 2018 forecasts and 10.9 time 2020 forecasts.  A more reasonable multiple of 14 would see the SP rise 30%.

2,2018-05-20,InAFakeBritishAccent,1,DDD vs SSYS vs others?,"First up. [This is me](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/342/ihave.jpg) regarding investing. Sorry if I sound a little dumb. My background is 3D printing. This is me trying to learn a bit else.

I bought 3D Systems at ~$9 around the time they tanked in 2014-15. I figured yes, they were overblown prior to that, but they'd make a comeback given their machines are pretty deeply entrenched in a commercial setting. DDD is now at 12.67. I kind of want to re-evaluate whether or not that company is going in a good direction and thought it would be fun to get some opinions.

Stratasys and DDD are the most entrenched in the commercial printer landscape last I checked with HP and GE trying to play catchup.  Oh, and Carbon3D, but they're a bit of a wildcard to me and not publicly traded.

I don't see 3D printing evolving very fast in a consumer setting, unlike the way I saw it starting to take root right next to CNC machines in prototype shops as a standard tool.

Investing-wise, is it bad to gauge a company based on how they're doing on the ground?"

4,2018-08-23,wirsteve,390,What's reddit's opinion of the next big thing in tech?,"Pretty obvious what it is now, ""Cloud Computing"". Companies have to ""move to the cloud"". Some companies don't even have directors of IT on staff, they just hire a consulting firm to move them to the ""cloud"" but they don't know what it is.

Let's say 5 years ago

* Everything was hosted locally or with an IT provider. Citrix for example was popular
* The number of apps in iOS app store and Play store have tripled - mobile is king
* Businesses slowly started to look at technology as a need and not as a luxury

Now 

* SaaS is king, hosting data in Azure, AWS or Google's data centers is popular
* Citrix is still used but in a different capacity
* You need a mobile app to pair with your website / company to be looked at seriously
* eCommerce has been changed dramatically with Square &amp; competitors

So what's next?

* Edge networking?
* A boom in security spending?
* Machine learning?
* Blockchain?
* VR &amp; AR?
* Internet of Things?
* Smart kitchens?
* 3D Printing?

We all know deep down, whatever the infrastructure is now, and whatever is popular now won't be in 2023. I'd love to hear what you guys think. Obviously my list isn't what you have to pick from. It's just some things that I think could potentially take off."
5,2018-09-20,pinkipopo,1,"Got 50k, where would you invest?","So, currently, I'm thinking about investing 50k. I'm starting a small translation business and a 3D printing outsource outfit. 50k isn't much; I can't buy real estate in terms of houses or apartments in my country, farming land would be an option (with an investment in facilities and renting, after a period of time maybe personal use), but I'm not sure. I thought about jumping on the AI train and investing into NVIDIA, Microtech and other perspective AI development companies, plus some into Coca Cola and Amazon, then again, I'm not sure how to go about it, I don't know where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

In essence, I thought about investing 10-15k into a stock portfolio, 10-15k into land and plots, 2-3k for starting up my business and the rest as an absorption sum. I also read a bit on betterment, but I'd like to hear your thoughts about it.

Thanks!"
