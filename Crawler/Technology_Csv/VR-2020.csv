0,2020-01-08,rambysids,1,Need help with buying and selling stock in the one place.,"I am still in the midst of doing more research in regards to investing in stock, following up and coming companies, etc.

I have invested money in different types of Crypto using the app CoinBase. This time I want to start expanding my investments.

I was wondering, is there an app or website where I can sign up and have my own wallet with all my Crypto in the one place as well as other stock I want to invest in. I mainly want to buy and/or sell fractional stock as some stocks are out of my price range to buy 'whole'.

If there is an app, can I buy any stock from companies such as Facebook or a VR company for example or even gold or silver? and can i transfer all my Crypto to my new wallet? Costs to sign up? Subscription cost? Any for free or little cost? or is it worth paying for a well known and safe trading company.

I reside in Australia if that helps.

If I am misinformed about anything, please inform me, don't give me hate :) and not too much jargon :P"

What other companies should I consider besides AMD? Are there any VR headset companies that are ahead?"

3,2020-03-28,MBlaizze,1,Could this pandemic lead to an explosion in Virtual Reality technology?,"Last night I played a virtual poker game with a few buddies on an app where we could see each other at a poker table, similar to Zoom. We were all drinking and laughing together, and had a great time. Nobody had to worry about drinking and driving, and our beds were a few feet away. At the same time, my wife had a cocktail making party with her friends on Zoom. They all followed my wife’s recipe instructions for making the same drink, and they had a blast. Before we both were going to login to our hangouts, we were worried that it would be awkward and uncomfortable, but it wasn’t at all. It became normalized within seconds. Then there are the millions of office workers and school students who are adding to the normalization of it all. However, one thing was missing compared to actually being in the presence of the people - their bodies. That’s where technology like this: https://youtu.be/6HS-ojdATmg can make a difference. If combined with people’s actual faces, like in Zoom/Skype, and once VR goggles are made into more of a sunglasses form factor, could we see an economic paradigm shift away from the old world brick and mortar economy, and into an internet based VR economy?"
4,2020-05-10,Scatchell,1,Suggestions on gaining AR/VR exposure through an existing fund,"Hey all - I know there are a few posts about this already, but I was struggling when searching the sub to find assets that represent an already balanced collection of assets, something like an ETF, that would gain me AR/VR exposure without too much trouble (i.e. not having to build a portfolio of specific stocks) - wondered if any investors on this sub had suggestions?

I realize companies like Facebook, Nvidia, HTC, etc. are making some of the big headsets, but I wondered if there were any funds people knew about that could help me gain exposure to those big players but also other related companies, like manufacturers of specific parts for this tech, companies that are building software for AR/VR, etc.

Any thoughts are much appreciated!"
5,2020-05-05,Bickl3s,3,Pandemic’s Long Term Impact on the US Economy?,"With unemployment surging, earnings reports missing expectations, dropping consumer spending and decreasing US economic output, seems like a good time to share ideas on the below. 

1. Industries most at risk and those that stand to benefit?
2. Effects on cash/crypto/securities/real estate? 

My brief thoughts:
- Market drops significantly in mid/late July when Q2 earnings disappoint. Followed by tough year/years ahead.
- At risk: Oil, Retail, QSRs
-To benefit: Big Tech, VR/AR, Logistics/Supply Chain, Vices (Weed/Alcohol/Tobacco)
- Cash devalued from stimulus, increased adoption of crypto (although not sure how much), drop in overall equities market with a few unicorns and safe bets, and a 6-8 month lag before sharp decline in RE prices due to lack of demand, sentiment and lowered consumer cash reserves."

\- FB ecosystem

This is the stock that i believe is invested in the right places and has a path forward in the global market. I work as a React developer in fintech and I greatly enjoy their technology. The reason I stopped using snapchat was because I couldn't use it on low connection in Mexico, but Instagram worked marvelously. I use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my family in mexico and Facebook to stay in touch with my mom. There's something extremely powerful about that in my opinion. 

They're conservative with their push and development of camera  and VR technology which is wise in my opinion give the many opportunities that exist in that space. They're pushing along with fintech in India, again with small business through Whatsapp. And they provide a suite of customer services for small business and entrepeneurs.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Microsoft

I think they will have a great run during the cloud era of software development. Their acquiring of Github AND NPM goes to show how in touch they are with developer servicing.

\- Cisco

Same as Microsoft but for IT.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Paypal

Paypal has a marvelous history and is a battle tested pioneer in the fintech space. I see them repeating their previous successes by acquiring Honey. I work with Honey in the fintech space and now I'm understanding that Paypal has an auto coupon scraper on my Amazon purchases while my Visa ones don't. This is the forward thinking I love from Paypal despite not being as flashy as Square.

\- Visa

They make a FUCKTON of money on transactions. Jesus christ.

\- Disney

Disney is quintessential american entertainment. I believe their deep roots in American culture and the entertainment industry will provide a solid bedrock for them for the generations to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Waste Management

Sanitation and environmental, like internet connection technology, are about the same when it comes to market penetration. It is a scarcity. Sanitation is a critical part of any society's development and wellbeing. I think WM will be there to benefit from increased urbanization and industriousness from technology and wealth growth.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kansas City Southern

I'm Mexican and my family are avocado farmers. I believe in the future prospects of Mexico and its relationship with its neighbors. Mexico is a bustling nation and many youth are international students that carry degrees. This is a far cry from having military policing streets in rural neighborhoods decades ago. Kansas city southern is part of the supply chain that connects Mexico to main industrious Mexican states like Monterrey, Jalisco, and Michaocan. I like rail in this regard because it's a lot of weight in one operation of heavy materials. So Canadians that use Mexican mining will also benefit from this railroad.

\- Nintendo

I believe in the future of gaming as a market and if I were to take a shot at who would be the most stable, I would vote for Nintendo. Like Facebook, they approach the family unit and grow generationally. I love their curveball approach to gaming and I think that creativity, along with it's customers trust, will be something I can hold onto for a long time versus companies that have a history of developing games like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Nintendo can take different forms: in the living room, at sweaty tournaments, online, mobile, on your phone, on a TV, in the movies, etc.

\- Impossible Foods IPO

I've been vegetarian for 10 years and Impossible Burgers has been one of the most mindblowing experiences of my life. The product is phenomenal and on a league of its owned compared to Beyond Meat. IMHO Beyond taste like cheap school lunchroom burgers and Impossible tastes like something I would be excited to feed my family. If their pork products are great then I am ALL in because Chicken products are by far the easiest thing to replicate. I'm extremely excited about this product

\- United Health or Cigna

This is only going to grow and wont change due to American politics for 8 years at a minimum.

**Closely watching**

\- Square

I work in the fintech space and I like their modest approach to financial services. Their acquiring of a bank charter is actually incredibly important due to all the procurement and legal processes that go behind being a fintech company (abiding by federal security laws, etc). The one reason I like Chase banking is because I enjoy their app. I see Square as a competitor to Chase, surprisingly.

\- Apple

Apple designs its products with customer service in mind. I think the future of education technology will likely go to Apple because of this. Their screens and cameras are wonderful and I can see them pioneering computer vision products because of this. They are THE American Tech company.

\- TMobile

Aggressive as hell and grew to be a large player through savvy moves across time. Their customer service is a highlight for me.

\- JPM

Customer service for banking is unmatched IMO. If any legacy banker will make it across changes, I believe Chase is doing what it takes to adapt and think forward.

\- Planet Fitness

$10 gyms, clean, and casual enough for the general population. You can't beat $10 gym membership when you're broke as fuck. I've been a heavy lifter before and still used Planet fitness in my transitions across states and whatnot. I need to look at their numbers more closely.

\- Volkwagen

I trust Europe and Japan to take EVs more seriously. I don't know who will seriously come close to competing with Tesla in the long run but they'll have to.

\- Panasonic

Panasonic, much like AMD, did not immediately reflect the value of what they have produced. AMD did not explode inline with bitcoin or cheaper GPU consumption, in the same way Panasonic did not reflect a massive spike in price after speculation in Tesla grew. They're an important arm to the EV market that spreads across many players ranging from Tesla to Toyota to big tech.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think Lyft's focus on customer service and regional clientele will pay off against Uber, who is growing too quickly and spreading thin. Lyft will benefit from the development of computer vision and Big tech's interest in automanufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crypto (Bitcoin or XRP)

I like crypto as a technology as a software engineer. I see the value in a faster process for procuring and exchanging legal tender that does not have to go through the bottleneck of the ACH process or through legal issues like the PATRIOT ACT or the Bank Secrecy Act. It still fundamentally respects those laws without the frustrations of banking service bottlenecks.  I think the halvening protocol has an interesting affect on Bitcoin and supply and the market that it's trying to generate.
