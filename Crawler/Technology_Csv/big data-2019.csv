# Apple stock rises despite revenue decline, downbeat outlook (MarketWatch)

**Article Link:** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-stock-rises-despite-revenue-decline-downbeat-outlook-2019-01-29](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-stock-rises-despite-revenue-decline-downbeat-outlook-2019-01-29)

**Summary:**

The key metric in Apple's AAPL, -1.04% fiscal first-quarter release was itsMarch-quarter revenue outlook, which came in at $55 billion to $59 billion.

Apple had preannounced the top-line number, calling for $84 billion in a letter to investors that it issued in early January.

Chief Executive Tim Cook said in Apple's release that while he was disappointed the company fell short of its initial revenue forecast for the holiday period, ""This quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide."" He said Apple has an installed base of 1.4 billion devices, ""An all-time high.""

Greater China accounted for $13.2 billion of the company's revenue in the period, compared with nearly $18 billion a year earlier.

Revenue from the company's iPhone business fell sharply as well, to $52 billion from $61.1 billion in the prior December period.

Apple's services revenue exceeded expectations by a hair, coming it at $10.9billion, compared with estimates for $10.8 billion.

Apple shares have fallen 27% over the past three months, while the Dow JonesIndustrial Average DJIA, +0.21% of which Apple is a component, has gained 0.6%

# EBay stock rises after earnings beat, initiates dividend (MarketWatch)

**Article Link:** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebay-stock-rises-after-earnings-beat-initiates-dividend-2019-01-29](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebay-stock-rises-after-earnings-beat-initiates-dividend-2019-01-29)

**Summary:**

EBay Inc. EBAY, -0.97% shares rose roughly 3% in the extended session Tuesday after the online retailer beat Wall Street earnings and sales expectations.

Adjusted for items such as changes to the U.S. tax code, among other things, earnings were 71 cents a share, compared with 59 cents a share in the year-ago period.

""We are confident in the strength of our business and future growth prospects, as demonstrated by our decision to institute eBay's first-ever dividend and increase our share repurchase program."" The company said that it is initiating a dividend of 14 cents a share, with the first quarterly payment to be paid aroundMarch 20 to shareholders of record on March 1.

EBay also said it expects to buy back $5 billion worth of stock in 2019.

For the first quarter, analysts model earnings of 61 cents on sales of $2.66billion.

For the full year, analysts estimate earnings of $2.59 a share and sales of$11.17 billion.

EBay said it expects first-quarter adjusted earnings of 62 cents to 64 cents a share and sales of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion; the company projects full-year adjusted earnings of $2.62 to $2.68 a share and sales of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion.

# A few of the secret portfolios Goldman gives clients are doubling the market's return this year (CNBC)

**Article Link**: [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/a-few-secret-goldman-portfolios-for-clients-are-doubling-the-return-of-the-market-so-far-this-year.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/29/a-few-secret-goldman-portfolios-for-clients-are-doubling-the-return-of-the-market-so-far-this-year.html)

**Summary:**

Goldman Sachs apparently knows the key to beating the market, but the bank is only telling its elite club.

The bank has created 39 portfolios exclusively for its clients, and 34 of them are outperforming the market this year while three are posting an 11 percent gain, more than doubling the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date return.

The three winning baskets are ""High revenue growth,"" ""High Sharpe ratio,"" and""Dual beta,"" according to a broad note to clients on Monday explaining the portfolios' constructions and growth outlooks.

Goldman has been handpicking stocks based on various proprietary themes and sectors for a decade, but these portfolios are only made available for its clients to trade on the Bloomberg terminal.

The bank treats the members of the baskets carefully and doesn't always disclose all the member stocks, even in its daily and weekly notes.

Along with good track records this month, the baskets also have solid long term track records.

The bank doesn't suggest buying and holding the various baskets all at the same time.

They recommend certain baskets at certain times based on the type of market environment.

Goldman warned clients at the end of last week about companies with big revenues from China, and specifically, Nvidia, days before the chipmaker released surprise disclosure on China slowdown and blew up its stock.

In the note, Goldman told clients to avoid its international sales basket and recommended its domestic sales basket instead for investors wanting to hedge against international risks.

# Indian home loan provider Dewan's shares slump over media report (Reuters)

**Article Link:** [https://in.reuters.com/article/dhfl-india/indian-home-loan-provider-dewans-shares-slump-over-media-report-idINKCN1PN1U0](https://in.reuters.com/article/dhfl-india/indian-home-loan-provider-dewans-shares-slump-over-media-report-idINKCN1PN1U0)

**Summary:**

NEW DELHI - Shares of home loan provider Dewan Housing Finance Corp fell 8percent on Tuesday following a media report that alleged financial misappropriation by the controlling shareholders of the company.

Dewan Housing, one of India's largest housing finance companies, said theCobrapost website's report ""Appears to have been done with a mala fide intent to cause damage to the goodwill and reputation"" and ""Resulting in erosion in shareholder value.""

In its online report, Cobrapost said publicly available data showed funds, including a large amount secured from Indian state banks, was diverted to shell companies in India and abroad to buy assets.

The website, which is best known for sting operations on businessmen, politicians and media houses, also said that the Wadhawans broke several laws governing companies.

India's Bank of Baroda said on Tuesday it had an exposure of 40 billion rupees to Dewan Housing and said it would have to look into the veracity of the allegations against the company.

Shares of Dewan Housing fell by as much as 12.3 percent to hit a low of 162.20rupees before recovering somewhat to close at 169.70 rupees, their lowest level in almost three years.

The shadow banking sector comprises around 11,400 firms with a combined balance-sheet worth more than 22 trillion Indian rupees.

3,2019-01-24,HFanalyst12,1,Titan (titanvest.com); Neither Fish Nor Fowl; Convenient Changes To Website After Disastrous Q4,"&amp;#x200B;

**Background – New Wave Of Investing**

I think both active and passive investing make sense for certain types of investors. What is most important is that they understand the nuances of the investment they choose. 

'Robo-advisors' like Wealthfront and Betterment have made the portfolio balancing process easier. These are kind of like the Casper of investing. Direct to consumer, nice website, but basically the same shit you’ve seen before. Most of what they offer is passive in nature and curates a portfolio based on age and risk tolerance, almost like a target retirement date fund. Passivity itself is not a new concept, but maybe these companies make the shopping experience better. All the power to them. Similarly, active investing is not a new concept but there have been attempts to bring Robo-management to the active space – this is where Titan comes in. There has always been and I personally believe there will always be a market for beating the market. However, *automation* is not the same thing as *active* management. This is why I think Titan ( [www.Titanvest.com](http://www.titanvest.com/) )  has a major problem and that’s what this post is about.

**Titan: Fish, Fowl, Or Neither?**

What Titan ([titanvest.com](https://titanvest.com/)) does is clearly not passive investing, which is probably what makes it stand out from other app-based investment products, or if you prefer to paint with a broad brush stroke, 'Robo-Advisors'. Simply by virtue of the portfolio concentration, re-balancing, and hedging, it looks a lot like a hedge fund but its not, technically. This is due mainly to issues of legal structure (managing separate accounts instead of being a pooled vehicle). They also don’t require accreditation, which is characteristic of a hedge fund. No less, the pitch is simple:

\- Mine 13F filings which show hedge fund positions

\- From a select list of hedge funds, Titan figures out which stocks are the 'most held' and thus labels them the best ideas

\- Construct a concentrated portfolio of 20 stocks based on these filings

\- Short the market as a hedge, 0 - 20% short exposure

On the surface, I’m sure this seems reasonable enough to the average investor. For full disclosure, I invested in the product to give it a try, about $1,000 which is a small portion of my overall investable assets. I was emotionally prepared to lose it all, and I viewed this as an experiment. I am neither sour about the experience nor do I have it out for this company, but I want others to understand the shortcomings of the product. I first came across this app last year when i saw an article about it online. I also saw a reddit post where some ebullient users touted the strategy - it's supposed to be a democratized version of a hedge fund with low fees and 'the best ideas'. (see: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8bd3pr/anybody\_every\_heard\_of\_or\_used\_titan\_titanvestcom/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/8bd3pr/anybody_every_heard_of_or_used_titan_titanvestcom/))

After putting some money to work, I had a moment of clarity where I thought it might make sense to critically analyze the thing I just threw $1,000 bucks at. The more I think about it, or ‘pull at the thread’ the more the concept unravels. I summarize these existential issues that Titan faces in a short list of 8 glaring issues. Let’s go one by one and discuss.

**Problem #1: Weak Concentration, Weak Diligence**

This is perhaps the biggest issue with Titan. The portfolio is made up of 20 stocks that are deemed good ideas simply because they are owned by many hedge funds. If you were a cynic, you would say ‘hedge funds in the aggregate haven’t lived up to their hype, and rarely outperform, so why is this a good thing at all?’. If you were generous you’d say, ‘so, we’re investing in all the crowded ideas…. Why would we do that if we wanted to beat the market’? it almost seems like by definition, investing in crowded longs is a sure-fire way to mimic the index at best with more volatility due to concentration. These stocks have massive technical unwinds. When selling starts, its fast and ugly. There is very little single stock research applied to these positions, if any. The team has not disclosed any such criteria. Bear in mind that these stocks are owned by *very sophisticated funds* for specific reasons and with teams of people monitoring them daily for news, data points or just about anything that will give them an edge. 

**Problem #2: No Dynamic Position Management**

An extension of problem #1 is that these positions in hedge funds are usually, you guessed it, hedged. Titan has no single stock hedges. So, if the best hedge fund in the world has a massive position showing up on their 13F, Titan has no fucking clue what hedges against this position exist. Maybe it’s a pair trade (ie. Maybe they are short a similar company). Maybe the position itself is a net short because the company owns a ton of puts (bearish options). Regardless of what the case may be, the problem remains that Titan simply doesn’t know and even if they do, their investment policy doesn’t capture the view. To be generous, you could assume they are applying some equity research or human curation to the process… which is fine, but then its really just another fund using 13Fs as a screen, but ultimately buying and selling stocks based on human decision making. 

**Problem #3: Stale Data**

13F filings come out well past the end of a quarter. The hedge funds that own these positions may be liquidating them the day after the quarter ends, or over a period of time, and it’s not abundantly clear that the team understands that the data is stale. 

**Problem #4: Titan Needs Speed**

Hedge funds trade. A lot. Titan does not. The re-balancing of the portfolio at the position level, if it truly depends on 13F data, cannot possibly be fast enough to be managing these positions in the way hedge funds do. An extension of the previous issue is that if you assume the biggest day of news for the average company, is its earnings day, not the day of the 13F filings, not only are you acting on stale 13F data, you aren’t even getting that data before earnings. Earnings are usually 3 – 5 weeks after each quarter ends. 13Fs don’t come out until mid-quarter. Clearly, there is a mismatch here in terms of data mining.

**Problem #5: Too Democratic**

The problem here is that the aspects of the fund Titan describes as benefits to investors are actually shortcomings. Lock ups in hedge funds exist for a reason. Ask Michael Burry , the big short guy whose investors tried to withdraw money a month before his credit default swaps on Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns made the fund a billion dollars. Accreditation and lock ups are built into hedge funds to protect people from themselves. Im not saying all hedge funds are great, I know they’re not. But some of these portfolios are constructed to play out over a period of time that retail investors may not have the stomach for. 

**Problem #6: No Clear Tax Policy**

The sample investor letter illustrates this issue well. It seems like NFLX was sold in Q1 after just 6 weeks of being held, perhaps because it was up 39%. But hedge funds are frequently looking for longer term gains of 100%+ in each position they hold and regardless, would be likely to at least try to benefit from holding the position to long term (one year or more) at which point the tax bill is basically cut in half. It’s not clear how Titan deals with this, but similar to a shitty mutual fund, I would not be surprised if investors that lost money in 2018 still get hit with a tax bill from harvesting of short term gains which is ass backward.

**Problem #7: Absurd Expectations, Backtesting**

The fund, which had no track record prior to early 2018, relied extensively on backtesting to pitch the model. On their website, they said “Since 2004, Titan has returned 14% annualized vs. the S&amp;P 500’s 9%. $5,000 invested back then would have yielded $29,000 from Titan and $16,000 from the S&amp;P.” This language is possibly illegal but is definitely mis-leading; it bills back-testing as actual performance (see “has returned”). The ‘Recent performance’ said that 2017, a year they were non existent as a fund, was a +33% year vs the S&amp;P500 at +21.8%. amazing! Titan had a collapsible button that said ‘disclosures’ that explains this hypothetical performance, but it was not obvious to an average investor that the performance was not actual – bear I mind, every investment product in existence has fine print, usually that says something boiler plate like ‘not indicative of future results’ – but the assumption is that billing of ‘performance’ is not hypothetical. I *hypothetically* bought Jeff Bezos out of Amazon in 1998 and now I am *hypothetically* banging Lauren Sanchez too. 

Similarly, the table with performance showed it as actual, not backtested data. The annualized return of 14% was from 2004 and the all time performance of +477% vs. the SP500’s 229% was staggering. Here, the fine print made no allusion to backtesting, or hypothetical results. You can see this page using the wayback machine or by clicking this link: [https://web.archive.org/web/20180821222316/titanvest.com/performance](https://web.archive.org/web/20180821222316/titanvest.com/performance)

**Problem #8: No market view**

To wrap up, Titan has no market view. After reading the annual letter ([https://cdn.titanvest.com/library/Titan\_Annual\_Letter\_2018.pdf](https://cdn.titanvest.com/library/Titan_Annual_Letter_2018.pdf)), it’s clear that these guys, while generally intelligent and well intentioned, have no nuanced market view. The summary points show that in fact, the fund underperformed the market by 150 bps. Next, that the global economy was strong (more like US strong, everyone else f’ed), that “no obvious macroeconomic risks” – ahem, global corporate credit, tradewars, interest rates and oh yeah peak employment (good short term, but kind of hard to go from fucking amazing to fucking amazing-er, so fears of a slowdown shouldn’t be dismissed) , not to mention psycho president and schizophrenic fed chair.  

**Changes To Marketing Message Reflect Turmoil**

I suspect the team doesn’t want to be sued so after a fucking nosedive 4th quarter they took a lot of backtesting data off the website. Interestingly, there is still a lot there that’s objectionable and I would advise them to take it down. For example, they don’t talk about compounding at 14% since 2004 anymore, but they still say 12.4% since 2006 on the performance page. They added the word backtesting (good call lawyer!) and “HYP” in parenthesis in the table. Not sure why they changed the base year here but it seems questionable. They took down the label of Titan’s performance vs. the S&amp;P500 on the green and blue chart on their home page, probably because 2018 sucked shit.

The coup de grace in the investor letter was the revelation that actually most accounts weren’t hedged in the 4th quarter, because Titan uses some sort of momentum trigger before they hedge the portfolio….  I would advise others looking at this product to know what you’re buying. You’re probably better off in a mutual fund, and if you are accredited, a real hedge fund. This seems like a recipe for disaster and I will predict that this fund does not withstand more than another 18 months. Should have had a lock up."
4,2019-01-22,BroadGolf,1,"Titan Invest - nothing but propaganda, losses, and general sketchiness","I first discovered Titanvest on reddit last year, and after reading a bit I put a few thousand dollars into it. After reading their annual letter this year, \*\*\*I'm definitely out\*\*\*.

&amp;#x200B;

I was taken in by their promise of bring ""hedge fund investing"" to everyone, and to making you a better investor. All of this marketing BS is on their website. But let's go through a few key points...

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Performance this year was pretty bad, :\*\*\*

* 2018 Q2:       3.6%    (versus S&amp;P500     3.4%)
* 2018 Q3:       7.1%    (versus S&amp;P500     7.7%)
* 2018 Q4:    -15.1%    (versus S&amp;P500 -13.5%)
* \*\*\*2018 total:   -7.5%    (versus S&amp;P500   -6.1%)\*\*\*

\*\*\*So they barely outperformed in Q2, trailed the market in Q3 and Q4, and significantly underperformed for the whole year. And we're paying fees for this?\*\*\*

\*\*\*And of course, the performance figures you can see on their site (where they say they had All-Time performance of 12.4% versus the S&amp;P500 of 9.1%) are HYPOTHETICAL. That is, completely made up.\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*The strategy is bullshit\*\*\*

* \*\*\*Bad data\*\*\*: They seem to be copying major hedge fund holdings from 13F filings. The problem is that those filings are delayed by months, and only tell a partial picture of a fund's strategy. So if you see that some great fund owns Facebook... well, all you know is that they owned shares a few months ago... they may have sold them off already, and also may have been completely hedged against a fall in Facebook stock through derivatives, a short position, or other internet stocks.
* \*\*\*ETFs are better\*\*\*: By the way, if this is a strategy you actually want, you can get the exact same thing from ETFs (\[more here\]([http://fortune.com/2017/11/17/hedge-fund-etfs/](http://fortune.com/2017/11/17/hedge-fund-etfs/))) but with LOWER FEES, MORE TRANSPARENCY, and support from any major brokerage from Schwab to Robinhood.
* \*\*\*Their ""Hedge"" doesn't make sense\*\*\*: They ""activate a hedge"" when the market has fallen a lot. I could write paragraphs about how stupid this is. Only after the market falls do they activate this, so you're mostly likely to loss money, then have a short position when the market starts to recover. But who knows - Titan is basically saying they can time the market with this, something almost no experienced investor tries to do. A hedge fund has an exposure target... they may play with it depending on conditions, but they don't try to ""activate"" a hedge after the market has fallen. This is stupid for a million reasons.
* \*\*\*Limited understanding\*\*\*: Finally, I don't think they understand basic principles. They seem shocked when a stock falls despite a ""good"" quarter - they don't understand (or pretend to not understand) that the investors might have had higher expectations than just ""good"". If revenue grows 10% but investors were expecting 15%, then the stock will likely fall. Investors (particularly hedge fund investors) understand this.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Other sketchiness\*\*\*

* \*\*\*Pure propaganda\*\*\*: Every time the market is up, they send out a self-congratulatory email (""Big Gains, Not That You Should Care"" was a subject line from a few days ago). Well of course, there are up days and down days, you can't just boast about the up days, unless you're also going to email us when the market falls.
* \*\*\*Videos are bullshit\*\*\*: They make a big deal of the education videos they put out on the app, which dumb down finance to a high-school level. It seems like all those condescending videos are just designed to distract you from the losses in the market. 
* \*\*\*They bury performance information\*\*\*: You would think based on these emails, that they're killing it. But you have to dig hard (e.g. page 9 of the annual report) to find the actual performance data. ""Hedge fund letters"" (not that Titan is a hedge fund) typically put this data at the top of page 1. 
* \*\*\*Spamming subreddits\*\*\*: They're all over some subreddits with a lot of bullshit commentary, as well as a lot of comments with seemingly-insightful-but-really-derivative commentary. Reddit is not a good place to shill a product like this.
* \*\*\*Hard to withdraw money?\*\*\*: There's a lot of comments in other threads about this. Hopefully I won't have trouble when I try to get my money back (what's left of my money, that is).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I wish them the best, but also I think some of these things needed to be discussed, and I didn't see any honest reviews out there. Best of luck to all of you, including the Titan team (which I think is going to learn a lot from this experience)."
5,2019-01-22,lagerbaer,1,"An analogy regarding ""TA"" versus Algo trading","Inspired by yesterday's XKCD cartoon post, there were lots of comments discussing how real quant / algo funds use TA to great success, and a lot of other comments ridiculing the idea of drawing lines over a price chart and trying to divine future price movements from it.

In a book (Advances in Financial Machine Learning) I read a nice analogy to this. Paraphrased:

If, today, you think you can grab a shovel, pickaxe and pan, move to the Yukon and strike it rich by looking for gold, you are severely mistaken. Gold just doesn't lie around on the surface any more. You won't stumble ass-backwards into a motherlode. On the other hand, the big mining corporations extract a shitton (metric) of gold. Way more gold than was mined in the entire 16th century by the famous Spanish treasure fleets. But it's microscopic amounts that you have to extract in complicated chemical process out of an even greater shitton of worthless earth and ore.

If you have to do the tools and knowledge, there's lots of gold around. If you're just one guy with some scrappy tools, there's just no way. Same with technical analysis. You need a whole research team of analysts to sift through raw data, process it, search for significant features, develop a trading strategy and actually successfully turn insight into money. Squinting at squiggly lines won't get you there. So basically, there's loads of alpha to be extracted, but it's microscopic and needs loads of know-how."
6,2019-01-18,g0ro,1,Why Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) should acquire Portola Pharmaceuticals (PTLA) - POTENTIAL BIOTECH M&amp;A,"**5 January 2019 (reposting)**

JNJ has $16 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Q318 and an additional $3.3 billion in marketable securities with net cash flows from operations of about $4 billion a quarter. Their total debt is $31 billion.

Under Janssen, they co-promote IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) with AbbVie (Pharmacyclics) which is turning out to be one of the best selling drugs in oncology. It represents the largest drug in JNJ’s oncology portfolio. Sales are growing and over a dozen clinical trials are in JNJ’s pipeline for additional indications. Within the ibrutinib pipeline on JNJ’s side are around 10 combination therapy trials, including those with rituximab and venetoclax. JNJ recorded over $700 M in worldwide sales of ibrutinib last quarter and its partner, AbbVie, recorded $972 M.

Xarelto (rivaroxaban) represents the largest drug in JNJ's cardiovascular/metabolism portfolio, with sales over $600 M last quarter in the US. Xarelto was developed in partnership and is marketed ex-USA by Bayer, and ex-USA revenues were around $1 billion last quarter. The number of lawsuits in regards to Xarelto continues to increase over claims in relation to bleeding. JNJ and Bayer recently said on the matter “…Plaintiffs continue to file 400-600 cases per month when they have no viable liability theory. It’s a never-ending cycle that needs to be stopped.” (reproduced from Forbes article “Unbeaten At Trial, Bayer and Janssen Say Cycle Of Xarelto Lawsuits 'Needs To Be Stopped’”, John O’Brien, June 2018). Supporting this additionally, from JNJ’s Q318 10-Q filing, “…The number of pending product liability lawsuits continues to increase…”

Over the last few years, Xarelto has lost extensive market share to Eliquis (apixaban), likely due to its perceived higher bleeding rates. While there have been no head to head clinical trials against apixaban, in-trial comparisons to warfarin have favored Eliquis with lower bleeding rates, and it nonetheless continues to gain share over Xarelto. Last month, JNJ filed an sNDA for Xarelto based on the MARINER and MAGELLAN trials, for extended prophylaxis of VTE in acute medically ill patients, an area with high discussion in the medical community. When asked about this in a Q&amp;A (Credit Suisse), John Curnutte, Executive VP of R&amp;D at Portola, said, “JNJ is taking a shot”, that they have invested a lot into the program between MARINER and MAGELLAN “so they may as well try…but we are not so sure they will succeed.” The outcome of the sNDA should be known in the second half of this year and will be critical to determine JNJ’s path forward.

Portola has three drugs in the clinic, and no other company can extract better value from all three of these than JNJ.

1. **BEVYXXA** JNJ has a big hand in the NOAC space, and Bevyxxa (betrixaban) has the label JNJ is looking for. With JNJ's leadership in this space, I believe their expertise would be highly favorable in commercialising Bevyxxa. More science and more education is key to change the treatment paradigm, as would be essential to penetrate this market.   
 
2. **ANDEXXA** Andexxa (andexanet alfa) can treat life-threatening bleeds associated with Xarelto (as well as Eliquis). Once again, their expertise in the field would be exceptionally useful in distributing the drug to hospitals all over the US. I am sure they have analytics of substantial value from Xarelto's commercialisation and their presence in the space is significant to succeed in commercialising Andexxa. Acquiring Andexxa would also present JNJ with a valuable opportunity to further advance their partnership with Bayer by licensing ex-USA rights to them, where Bayer will have significant advantage in commercialising Andexxa there. They will also mitigate their risk in this way and reduce the internal cost of the buyout if for some reason Andexxa is rejected by the medical community and has poor uptake. While Bayer could also acquire PTLA and cut a partnership deal with JNJ on Andexxa, the total value that can be created from PTLA's assets as a whole would not be as optimal as by a JNJ buyout.   
 
3. **CERDULATINIB** There is a large interest in dealing with ibrutinib-resistant CLL or CLL that has become refractory to ibrutinib. Preclinical work has shown cerdulatinib to induce apoptosis in CLL cells that are ibrutinib-resistant. It inhibits IL-4 signalling in vitro, which may protect CLL cells from ibrutinib-mediated apoptosis. For the science-minded, read published papers: *""Dual SYK/JAK inhibition overcomes ibrutinib resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Cerdulatinib, but not ibrutinib, induces apoptosis of tumor cells protected by the microenvironment.""* and *""The Dual Syk/JAK inhibitor Cerdulatinib Antagonizes B-cell Receptor and Microenvironmental Signaling in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.""* While cerdulatinib was most recently highlighted with impressive responses rates in r/r PTCL and CTCL (ASH 2018), there remains great potential in treating B cell cancers. Partial responses have been seen in an ibrutinib-relapsed FL patient, and a venetoclax-relapsed SLL patient in the recent Phase 2 trial. Portola is seeking to develop an accelerated approval pathway in certain kinds of tumour subtypes. The company has also expressed interest in finding a partner for cerdulatinib. I believe ibrutinib, venetoclax and cerdulatinib triple/dual combinations could be paradigm shifting and may produce unprecedented results in certain types of B cell cancers. Each drug counteracts a dysregulated pathway essential to cancer cell survival/proliferation. These possible combinations can be done most efficiently in the framework of the existing JNJ/AbbVie partnership. If cerdulatinib is successful in these combinations, it would boost both companies' top line revenues. Hence, acquiring cerdulatinib can be beneficial to the IMBRUVICA franchise and would allow JNJ to extend its partnership with AbbVie. The JNJ/AbbVie partnership will also mitigate JNJ's risk if for some reason cerdulatinib or a cerdulatinib-consisting combination fails to get approval. Regardless, the choice to take cerdulatinib into combinations with ibrutinib or venetoclax, or both, would be at the order of the owner/s. If JNJ does not acquire PTLA, an AbbVie acquisition is the only other option to get this done efficiently. However, AbbVie has no presence in the cardiovascular space, and whether the company can create added value from Andexxa and Bevyxxa is uncertain. It is certainly not as optimal in synergy as a JNJ acquisition. It should also be noted that JNJ is in charge of Imbruvica in FL (which cerdulatinib has had great data in so far), while AbbVie is in charge of Imbruvica in CLL and DLBCL.   
 

In the JNJ Q2 conference call, CEO Alex Gorsky said in response (albeit in relation to medical device acquisitions), ""...I won't comment specifically on exactly what size or obviously what companies, but when we think that the strategy is right, that it fits with our portfolio, that we feel that ultimately we can actually create value, based upon the asset and operationalize it and execute, we are ready to do so."" I believe Portola's assets fit perfectly into JNJ's pharmaceutical portfolio. No other company can create as much value from these assets as JNJ can. 

PTLA has an EV of \~$1.1 billion as of 5th January 2019. I predict PTLA's stock price will generally rise for the next several months on outperforming Andexxa sales from the current price of $19.38 to potentially around $35-40. Upside includes Andexxa (Ondexxa) approval by the EMA (Q219) and favorable discussions with the FDA on cerdulatinib (Q119). When the FDA answers to the Xarelto sNDA (\~Q319), PTLA's MC could be around $2.5-3.2 billion ($38-49 a share). A buyout premium of 50%, which may be more favorable to JNJ than PTLA at that time, gives a buyout price per share of $57-74 (or a MC of $3.7-5 billion). Obviously, a lot of things could go wrong over the next few months to rule this out. There are obviously a lot of risks here and I do not recommend purchasing or holding shares solely on the basis of a potential buyout, but I believe these two companies need to talk M&amp;A, if they are not already. Besides this, I believe there are many other positive drivers for PTLA and I have omitted detailed valuation of the company's assets - do your own due diligence.

&amp;#x200B;

***Aw fuck, not this guy again.***

&amp;#x200B;

That's right, you dildonic buttfuck. You better sit your ravaged buttcheeks down for this one, because I'm about to save your sorry ass from this pathetic bear market.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, the stock price has collapsed. Volume has collapsed. The company damn near ran out of cash and...

[*...it's about to make biotech executives explode fucking diarrhea all over themselves.*](https://i.imgur.com/nmYoq7R.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

***Yeah, right.***

&amp;#x200B;

[Remember this scene from the Big Short?](https://youtu.be/SQTbbUASPLQ)

In this scene, we see how our protagonists holding swaps should technically have huge profits due to all the collapsing CDOs, but since the big banks refuse to correctly value their swaps, they're still left with nothing.

If you take a look at Neurotrope, it's in a similar seat. The last trial (especially the ad-hoc analysis) showed results that have **never** been seen before in the history of Alzheimer's, and yet Big Pharma &amp; media keep sweeping it under the rug and are instead focusing on literally every other biopharma out there.

The market doesn't give a single shit about this company, and yet it's about to announce results in a couple of months that could cause several major players in the industry to shit their pants in collective terror as they realize that they dumped (and are still dumping) billions of dollars into the wrong Alzheimer's theory.

And not only is the biotech industry in denial, [but there are also researchers out there being denied research funds for simply wanting to try a different approach to AD](https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/29/alzheimers-research-outsider-bucked-prevailing-theory/), rather than the same old horseshit that the industry has been beating to death for decades.

Then again, why wouldn't they wanna keep this quiet?

Imagine how many researchers are going to lose their jobs once their boss finds out they're working on a drug that does jack shit (Just watch as Biogen's aducanumab trial drops dead in 2020 and their stock fucking tanks).

[That's why this is such a huge opportunity.](https://i.lensdump.com/i/Av10Do.png)

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you that aren't completely braindead and want to read the papers that prove this shit works, here's the link:

[https://justpaste.it/4frnd](https://justpaste.it/4frnd)

If you are too stupid to read research articles you should at least read the abstracts, or even just the titles, and if you can't even do that you should honestly just kill yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, treating AD is big news on its own, but that's not what makes this the greatest opportunity I have ever seen.

If you read the research papers, you can see that the drug works by repairing the wiring in the brain using a pathway that's **already inside the brain.**

In other words, this isn't some miracle cure that fixes everything through magic. It just activates the repair system we already have inside our brains.

&amp;#x200B;

***And why is this relevant?***

&amp;#x200B;

It's relevant because it possibly means that this isn't just an AD drug, but a drug for repairing brain damage in general.

The company isn't officially talking about all these indications yet, but if you take a look at their [massive fucking patent portfolio](https://patents.justia.com/inventor/daniel-l-alkon), you can see that they eventually want to use this thing to treat:

*- Alzheimer's Disease*

*- Fragile X*

*- Niemann-Pick C*

*- Synaptic damage/Synaptic loss*

*- Stroke*

*- Mental retardation*

*- Autism*

*- Parkinson's Disease*

*- Dementia*

*- Parkinson's dementia*

*- Frontotemporal dementia*

*- Vascular dementia*

*- Depression*

*- Bipolar disorder*

*- Schizophrenia*

*- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder*

*- Brain injury*

*- Traumatic brain injury*

*- Brain injury induced by irradiation*

*- Rett Syndrome*

*- Lewy body dementia*

*- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy*

*- Multiple Sclerosis*

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and did I mention that they have an exclusive license with the only entity in the world that can synthesize this drug? Meaning that no one else can treat neurological disorders with it?

&amp;#x200B;

***That's impossible. You're stupid. Fuck this scam. Fuck you.***

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, the FDA has already granted the company an Orphan Drug Designation for treating Fragile X.

Second of all, [Dr. Alkon invented an AD test so accurate, it was given a Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/neurodiagnostics-llc-new-alzheimers-assay-granted-breakthrough-device-designation-by-us-food-and-drug-administration-300731304.html)

And if you still don't believe me, **read the goddamn papers** and see the proof for yourself. They are all peer reviewed and published in highly respected scientific journals. This isn't some kiddie land bullshit we're talking about.

Fuck, just read the abstract of this paper about multiple sclerosis: [https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis](https://www.scribd.com/document/386853846/Bryostatin-1-alleviates-experimental-multiple-sclerosis)

Even some random scientists that have nothing to do with the company independently proved that this thing works for MS too.

&amp;#x200B;

***Alright, so if this thing really works, why are you posting this now when the current trial won't finish until July?***

&amp;#x200B;

Because once you hear about it in the news, it's already too late.

&amp;#x200B;

I was too slow with [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/627c8w/dd_alkon_the_falcon_a_tale_of_big_brainz_50000/), but since people misunderstood the results and ran away like a bunch of pussies I can now be early enough with a second post.  That means you now have plenty of time to pick your nose and slap your nuts while you decide if this is worth your time or not.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, this time around there won't be any patients on Memantine to fuck up the results like they did last time.

&amp;#x200B;

***What's the deal with Memantine?***

&amp;#x200B;

To keep it simple, Memantine blocks the NMDA receptor in your brain. Don't worry about what that is. The important part is that by doing so it blocks the effects of Bryostatin.

&amp;#x200B;

To show what an impact it had on patients, here's the results that were presented in 2017 with all patients included:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg](https://i.lensdump.com/i/AnbOrP.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Kinda lame, right? Well here's what those same results look like when you separate the different patient groups:

[https://i.lensdump.com/i/ABRMJD.png](https://i.lensdump.com/i/ABRMJD.png)

&amp;#x200B;

If you don't like charts, here's the raw clinical trial data (Read the part that says ""Post-hoc Outcome""):

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?view=results](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02431468?view=results)

&amp;#x200B;

Look at how much the SIB scores improve once you remove patients on Memantine.

&amp;#x200B;

***Wait, what the fuck is an SIB?***

&amp;#x200B;

The SIB scale is a scale for moderate-severe AD patients that basically measures how retarded you are. The higher your score, the less retarded you are. The scale goes to 100 and once you hit max, you're no longer considered to have moderate-severe AD (I never studied neuroscience though so don't quote me on this).

Mild AD patients use the MMSE scale, but that's not relevant here since this was a trial for moderate-severe patients. The drug is however expected to work in patients with all stages of AD due to its MOA.

Here's a shitty picture that hopefully makes the scales easier to understand and compare:

[https://i.imgur.com/s61opUd.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/s61opUd.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Patients in this trial started with SIB scores around 80, and patients in the 20 dose bryo group had a mean SIB change of +6.7 after 11 weeks of treatment and 30 days of just waiting around and watching patients improve even after dosing had stopped.

&amp;#x200B;

***I don't know what the fuck you just wrote, but okay, the science seems solid. What about all these warrants though?***

&amp;#x200B;

Like with most things that sound too good to be true, this too has a catch. In this case it's the shitfuck ton of warrants.

If they're all exercised, they will bring in almost $100 million for the company, which should be more than enough to get their drug onto the market and start generating revenues, which means no more significant dilution since they don't need to raise more cash.

As of today, the fully diluted share count is at around 25 million, but let's raise it to 30 million instead because fuck you.

Even with a potential 30 million outstanding shares, this thing is still incredibly undervalued. Here's why:

[Back in July, Biogen &amp; Eisai made an announcement that they had positive results for their AD trial. Soon after, investors added $20 billion to their market caps in total.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/25/biogen-and-eisai-unveil-ban2401-alzheimers-disease-trial-results.html)

Yes, the results eventually turned out to be shit and the market cap gains disappeared soon after, but I want you to focus on how investors reacted to the positive news.

Now first of all, Biogen's drug was only expected to slow the decline of patients and not actually treat them.

Second of all, their drug was only meant to delay mild AD rather than treat brain damage in general, but hey, fuck it. Let's use $20 billion as our starting point anyways.

In that case, a successful trial would make Neurotrope worth **AT LEAST** $667 per share (20 billion divided by 30 million).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not even gonna bother looking up how many people are affected by the neurodegenerative disorders I mentioned above, but if we stick to just Alzheimer's, we can safely assume at least 10 million people will be needing this drug every year to not fucking die. There's about 50 million people around the world living with dementia today, and about 300 million are suffering from depression, but whatever, let's continue.

Let's say the drug sells for $500/month and Neurotrope gets 30% from royalties. Actually, let's drop it to 20% because go fuck yourself. That's still $100 in profits per patient each month, or $1200 per year for each patient.

Multiply $1200/year by 10 million patients and you get a company generating $12 billion in yearly profits.

Slap a P/E ratio of 15 on top of that, and you have a company worth $180 billion, or about $6000 per share.

For reference, that would give you a 150,000% profit if you bought in at $4 (Right now it's trading at $3.72).

And since this stock is so thinly traded, even a monkey fucking a banana in Cambodia can move this thing over 20% in a day.

&amp;#x200B;

***So what's your point with all this?***

&amp;#x200B;

As the wise Dr. Burry ^((my dick in your ass lmao)) says in The Big Short: [""I may have been early, but I'm not wrong.""](https://youtu.be/pLLgNi5UmB0?t=115)

&amp;#x200B;

What you're looking at here could very well be the mother of biotech black swans.

11,2019-02-17,parttimechef,1,"Another wash sale question, ouch!","Sort of new with trading stocks. This year I did a lot of trading, mostly with risky mining stocks. Got up big with them in 2017, mainly lithium and cobalt stocks. Anyway, 2018 was a terrible year for those stocks. I was buying and selling in tens of thousands of dollar chunks.

One stock in particular that I got up on big time in 2017 started to fall in the beginning of the year. So I sold, made over 100k profit. As it kept falling I thought it this is lowest it will go. So I bought again, then it kept falling and I sold again. I did that a couple times with that stock and one other.

Anyway, by then end of the November, I had closed out all of the positions. All sold. 

I have been using turbo tax for years. Last week, I fired it up and started putting in the data for 2018. When it came time to import my 1099-B I thought this should be helpful since I lost money over the year. 

The form shows a short term loss of 175,000. And long term gain of 145,000. Great, I thought. What I didn't see was the wash sale disallowed of 130,000 in my short term chart. 

In fact, I wasn't aware of the wash sale rule at all. 

When I imported my 1099 into turbo tax, my refund swung 15k in the other direction. And now I owe over 10k. 

So, my question is...am I on the hook for the 10k+ or is there something I can do? I'm leaning towards having a CPA do my taxes this year but wanted to get some other opinions first."
12,2019-02-15,Valee_D,1,Automated Portfolio Upkeep,"Hey guys,  

I've been a long time lurker and decided today was a big day for my portfolio. 2018 was my first year in the stock market and I managed my portfolio pretty well, I made 30% on ELY, 40% on AAPL, traded some volatility with DPX and LTHM's IPOs and made about 700 dollars over the course of the year for a 11% gain. 

I credit a majority to luck with timing and with the back end of 2018 getting pretty scared I pulled back my money to re-evaluate how to handle things. I opted for 2019 to take my human emotion out of the equation and just buy good companies throughout the year as I'm still young, with a good job, and plenty of time to soak up dividends. I've since automated this process. I use backend API calls to load data into my own database and use a lot of python and SQL to formulate buy prices each day for about 23 companies I've picked that I like for the foreseeable future. The only manual thing in this process is me picking the companies myself to add to the list. 

I was wondering if anyone else has made such a process for their portfolios? If there's any pointers or things I should be weary of? At the end of the day I of course still control the algorithm that determines the buy prices each day and through quite a few test runs I think it lines up with my risk tolerance pretty well. 

Any thoughts?

13,2019-02-14,AHoomanBeanz,1,Adam Rodman's -- founder/CIO of Segra Capital Management (Dallas-based Hedge Fund) -- arguments for an emerging uranium supercycle,"Text is from an interview transcript he did with RealVision...

&amp;#x200B;

The way that I would boil down everything that's happened over the last 18 months-- supply cuts, growing demand out of emerging markets, every catalyst that we've listed-- is shifting the power to that of the uranium mining industry globally. They now wield more power enforcing that bid offer spread in the market to be crossed, because they have now shown that they're willing to shut in production, by spot to converge to two prices, leaving utilities in a bad position to source their material when the contracting cycle starts without it being at much, much higher prices.  

My name is Adam Rodman. I am the founder and CIO of Segra Capital Management, a Dallas based hedge fund. We've been particularly focused on the nuclear power and uranium space over the last several years. And Real Visions invited me back here today to talk about it for, I think, the third installment of Segra's views on the topic. 

**What's the function and demand for uranium?**

For those of you who missed the first two installments, what we've been very focused on is the commodity, uranium, the mined substance commonly known as yellowcake or U308.  

It's a very niche and kind of small commodity in the scheme of things, but powers or is the critical fuel for what is arguably the most important power source globally, which is nuclear power. And so in the most simplest terms, uranium, U308, yellowcake is a mined powdery substance that global producers pull out of the ground in far flung places such as Kazakhstan, but also in the US, Canada, and Australia. It's then enriched and converted into fuel that can be used by the globe's reactors. And that would be nuclear power plants.  

**Can you explain the current state of the market?**

So one of the big questions that were asked often is around our call from I think the episode we did for Real Vision in November, December 2017, that some of the world's biggest and best minds were going to have to come offline, essentially, as some of their contracted material was going to come up for recontracting, given how low prices were. So generally speaking, a miner, a producer of uranium will sell forward into long term contracts and lock in a price. And while we've now been in this multi-year bear market, many producers stayed solvent and profitable because of those past contracts.  

But as time moves on and the cycle progresses, and eventually, these producers have to restructure their contracts, market prices tend to prevail. And what we tried to hammer home back a little more than a year ago now in our first installment was that no miner was rationally going to sell their pounds at a loss in a new contract. 

And so we were good or we were lucky in predicting that Cameco in particular was going to be forced to permanently shut down MacArthur River. At the end of 2017 they announced a temporary shutdown, and then a permanent one just this past summer in 2018, which removed a significant portion, 15% to 18% of world supply from the market kind of in one fell swoop, which is a very, very big deal. 

But really, the economics behind that decision to a certain extent still apply today. So what I urge everybody to keep looking at is really, what the global marginal cost curve is in the world, which is where people can profitably mine the next marginal pound of uranium versus prices in the market today. And really, when I was last on, or in the first full installment a little more than a year ago-- I forget exactly-- but uranium prices were either in the high teens or low 20s. We've moved now closer to $30, which is a very good return on a percentage basis. And I believe it makes uranium the best performing hard commodity for 2018, which was a brutal year for resources.

But reminding everybody that we have a long way to go. Because even if spot prices are $28 to $30, marginal costs are likely twice that going forward. And given that we see pretty significant deficits over the coming five or 10 years, marginal cost becomes all important, and it's much, much higher than it is here. 

**How is uranium traded?**

The uranium market is unique not only kind of in how off the radar it is, but also, in the way that it's traded. So there are really two important prices. One you can pull up on your Bloomberg. And unfortunately, it's the less relevant one which leads to a lot of the opportunity in the market, the inefficiency in the market. And the second is the contract market, which is essentially a bespoke bilateral agreement between XYZ utility and a producer of uranium. And those numbers get aggregated by third party sources, but they are not public and transparent in the way that spot prices are. 

You can pull up spot prices on a Bloomberg terminal. It's technically quoted in spot and the futures market. But again, it's pretty thinly traded, and this is somewhat of an indicative price. It has been important for sentiment for reasons that I think we can maybe get into when we talk about supply and demand a little bit further.  

But it's not exactly relevant to the market, because when again, let's take a utility, let's just say, Duke Energy goes out to supply their long term fuel requirements. They don't source the bulk of that material in the spot market. They don't go in and buy every day. They will go to one of the producers of uranium and essentially strike a term contract whereby they receive a predetermined amount of material at a predetermined price delivered to them in all the years that the contract specifies. 

The market today has had very, very little-- in fact, 2018 had just about no contract volume going through-- despite a rising spot price. And to take it back to the two different prices, it's important because spot prices maybe are a little bit of a sentiment indicator. As people look to see whether or not things are going up or down, spot might be a daily price that you can look at. But the economics of any mine or miner is going to be driven by where they're ultimately able to contract their uranium long term.  

We believe those prices today are effectively at the marginal cost, at a minimum. Meaning that prices of uranium today are really $45 to $65 depending on jurisdiction, et cetera, even though the spot price only shows $30. But I think what the market is waiting for-- and again, why the opportunity continues to improve, get better and better even after the MacArthur mines shut down, spot prices rallied, is that the market is waiting to see for contracting start. And people, investors, especially after an eight year bear market, are skeptical that prices will actually be at an economic price.  

And I guess what we believe strongly and what I'd be urging viewers is to be looking for in whatever news source or other third party source you can work contracts eventually get struck, because we believe it has to be at an economic price. That economic price is almost 100% higher than the current spot price. And that that is the critical data point for the market to really take off. Because again, the spot prices, while they might be a feel good price, a sentiment indicator, a directional indicator, they're not driving the business model necessarily of any mining company out there that mines uranium.

**What's the catalyst for prices to move higher?**

Production cuts and spot buying has led to a very strong move in the underlying commodity in 2018. But important catalysts to look for the space as a whole really revolves around contracting. Getting back to the basic dynamics of the uranium market, it's a pretty simple market. You have really, one buyer, and that's global utilities. And you have a relatively small group of mines that produce and then sell to those utilities.  

But unlike other commodities, and I think I mentioned this in some of the other interviews or segments that I did for Real Vision, demand is completely inelastic. It doesn't really come in when prices are low. It doesn't really stop when prices are high. It just really comes in around the cycle.  

But when utilities find that they have uncovered requirements going forward, usually, for the next five or 10 years, they re-enter the market. Again, buying not because prices are low or high, but buying purely on need. And that's because the actual uranium price, the U308 price, is a very, very small percentage of the cost of operating a reactor.  

Going forward, what are the all important catalysts for the uranium market as a whole really are uranium buying, the beginning of the contracting cycle, and then where they are going to be able to find those pounds of uranium that they need for their requirements into the future. They being the existing nuclear reactors, but also, the very large quantity of new reactors, which are being built and delivered over the next several years in the emerging markets.  

And given that we are forecasting a deficit, and a deficit that doesn't have a good chance of being met because of the lack of Capex invested in the space over the last eight years, we think that they might have a lot of trouble doing so. Meaning that prices can really accelerate to the upside, again, once the contracting cycle begins.  

The other element this thesis is that there are a lot of natural catalysts that have to occur in this market in the case that we're wrong in our views. And what do I mean by wrong in our views? Let's just say that contracting is delayed, utilities don't come in to buy, meaning that there is no contract price that goes through at $50 or $60, that then justifies further mine development, and new supply coming into the market.

Well, the economics of the existing mine base isn't getting any better. In fact, costs are rising. So it's an environment where we have a rising cost curve. The price dynamics that forced Cameco to shut down MacArthur River, won't be changing in that circumstance. So again, in this low price environment, only more supply is going to be forced to come off as less legacy contracts exist. So producers are going to be forced to strike new contracts at prevailing market prices, which is below their cost of mining and as they face the natural depletion of their resources.  

However, as we saw in 2018, and as will continue in 2019 and 2020, if prices don't rise to restart mines, the likes of Cameco and other producers will follow, will buy in the spot market, which is cheaper than producing. Creating kind of a natural floor in the market.  

So while that's not a catalyst per se, we still look at it as a driver of prices short term. Because the spot market again, is thin. It's not exactly relevant to utilities, but it is important for setting a base in terms of the way that market dynamics are established. And that base should, in our opinion, continue to rise in a noncontracting environment, acting almost as its own catalyst, at the very least, as a margin of safety. Because you have a bid, a persistent bid in the market to be buying material, even if the contracting cycle doesn't start. And then that seems to be lost on all on a lot of market participants.  

What is lost on a lot of investors is that if prices stay, let's just say, where they are now, producers will continue to shut in supply. Take the pounds that would otherwise be coming out of mines, and replace that with spot market purchases. Which will at very least underpin that price at these levels, if not drive it higher, until that contracting cycle starts. So call that a catalyst, if you want, a natural catalyst. Or at the very least, you know, call it a margin of safety. But either way, it's a very strong dynamic which gives, I think, investors protection here, even in the downside. While we wait for the extreme portions of the thesis to come over the next one, two, three plus years.

**Why haven't equities moved up as fast as the commodity?**

So one question that we get asked often, given that we've been kind of vocal proponents of this idea over the last year, year and a half, is why we haven't seen kind of a lockstep move in the equity space with the price of spot. Again, spot rising from the high teens towards $30, that's a significant return. No equity in the space has matched that I can think of, the return of the underlying commodity. And so why is that?  

Well, before we get into it, let's talk about the market structure. The uranium and nuclear power related sector has been decimated in the post-Fukushima world. Talking about uranium specifically, the market capitalization was around $130 billion pre-Fukushima. There were 450 plus companies in the space. And today, we have 40 companies, and a market cap even when including giants like Cameco Corp, and now, Kazatomprom that is under $10 billion. And before Kazatomprom's IPO in 2018, it was around $7 billion. 

It's been really decimated, and there aren't a lot of options. In terms of the companies that are left-- really, most of the companies are miners. But they get broken down into those that are currently in production. So they have an active mine. Those that are developing mines or restarting mines if the price gets to a level that's economically viable. And then there are really, exploration companies. So companies that are going out and trying to build a resource base to eventually build a mine.  

So when we take that, let's say, opportunity set in the context of the uranium price, maybe we can understand why the equity space hasn't really followed suit. Undoubtedly, the producers, those that are currently producing, have seen the best performance within the space. And that's probably obvious, because your average investor looks at what they're going to end up selling the price for. In the market or in a contract that's rising, it's better for their business model.  

But development companies and exploration companies have been laggards. And they've really traded more defensively than the resource sector, which had a very, very bad 2018. But they have not been moving in lockstep. And that's because the critical component to them having a viable business model is a contract price that enables them essentially, to fund their mine development or exploration, and then produce economically in the future.  

And we think there is a huge opportunity in this, generally speaking, because we forecast supplydemand, which we believe goes into a significant deficit. And then we layer over a price that we believe the world needs to see those various pounds at different time intervals and a different demand levels to essentially bring that production online. And what that makes us highly confident in is that the contract price, and the forward price, however you want to think about it, today is above $55 or so globally for the next marginal pound.  

And if and when that happens, you know, contract cycles are inevitable. Utilities exist in the world. It's actually a growth industry. Demand for nuclear is growing. And they will eventually contract. In fact, the upcoming years are heavy contracting years.  

**What do you say to skeptics of the thesis?**

Yes. So people who are skeptical of the market would maybe point to the lack of equity follow through for most of the sector as showing that it's wrong, or that prices aren't going to rise and. I just choose to take the other side of that. Again, contract prices are what's relevant. We didn't see contract pricing in 2018. Part of that is due to the section 232 petition filed by US miners, essentially asking the government to put a quota system in on US uranium, forcing US utilities to buy a certain quota of material from US producers. Until a judgment is finalized on that, US utilities have been absent from the contracting market, and global utilities have followed the US block in waiting to see the resolution before contracting.  

But that doesn't mean that the price isn't going to be higher. In fact it gives, I think, investors a very small window of opportunity in a highly inefficient market to front run the inevitable, which is contract prices that reflect the economic price of mining. Which again, is much higher than the market is being given credit for.

**What is section 232?**

 In the last section, I mentioned section 232. Let me just quickly and simply kind of summarize what that is and why it matters. Many viewers might remember the petition to the Trump administration to kind of protect the US steel industry from foreign dumping of steel. And the avenue by which they asked the Trump administration to protect that domestic industry was called a section 232 petition.  

It goes to the Commerce Department. It essentially presents why action needs to be taken to protect a certain domestic industry. The uranium mining industry in the US took a lead from steel companies, and decided that because the likes of Kazakhstan, potentially Russia, had been selling cheap, cheap material into the market, pushing down prices, and thereby, endangering their business models, that they too, should get a form of protection from the Commerce Department so that they could be viable.  

The reason it becomes extremely relevant here again, probably more so than for other commodity markets, is that it put US utilities and global utilities in a holding pattern for striking new term contracts. And that is the only demand in this market. There is almost no financial speculation, at least not yet, in the uranium market where the likes of you or I would go in and take very, very large uranium positions expecting a resolution, and expecting utilities to come in.  

It happens a little bit here and there, and there were some financial volume speculator volume going through in 2018. But it's not like oil, or copper, or really, any other commodity in that sense. So it's all important that utilities enter. But while they wait to find out how the US government is going to rule on where they are allowed to source their uranium fuel, everything has been put on hold so.  

And I think the most important thing to understand about the way that utilities interact with producers, and therefore, why 232 ends up being important, is that the price of uranium. And by that, I mean the price at which a utility can source contracts for uranium has been, in our opinion, at $45 or $50 or $55 for the last several years. But no transactions have taken place.  

A year ago, spot prices were at $20. And a fuel buyer would go to their manager and say, listen, we don't have uranium for delivery in 2022, '23, '24, and '25. We're a little low. We should go buy some. And the fuel manager would say, great, go out there, and try and source material. Fuel buyer goes to XYZ uranium production company, says, hey, we're looking for a four year contract, where are you guys going to sell this material? And they say $50.  

Fuel buyer goes back to fuel manager and says, $50 is the price. And the fuel manager pulls up his Bloomberg terminal and sees spot prices at $20, and says, there's no way I'm paying more than 100% premium to what I see on the screen. The market's been oversupplied for many, many, many years. There's no reason for me to move.

And the way that I would boil down everything that's happened over the last 18 months-- supply cuts, growing demand out of emerging markets, every catalyst that we've listed for you not only in this segment, but the ones before-- is shifting the power to that of the uranium mining industry globally.  

That's to say that they now wield more power enforcing that bid offer spread in the market to be crossed. Because they've now shown that they're willing to shut in production, by spot to converge to two prices, et cetera leaving utilities in a bad position to source their material when the contracting cycle starts without being at much, much higher prices.  

And 232, just to tie it all together, just forced the market to wait a little bit longer, because those contracts weren't going to happen or aren't going to happen until we get a resolution.

**Why do you have such high conviction in this trade?**

We as a firm have obviously dedicated a lot of time to this topic. And the question I think for many, is maybe, why, or why is this cycle so different. In the context of a commodity cycle that has inelastic demand, deficits are all important. And not a lot of people that are around in the investment community today were here investing the last time the uranium market went into a deficit, which was many decades ago.  

Even when we've seen epic price runs to the tune of multiple hundreds of percent in a few quarters time, it was done in a balance to surplus market. Which leads us to wonder you know exactly what is going to happen in the uranium market if we do stay in sustained deficit. And to be clear, by our numbers, and I believe we've done as much work as anybody, if not more on the topic, we're in deficit now, and we will be in sustained deficit for the next several years going forward.  

And the longer it takes for the price to rise, the more severe the deficit is going to be in the future. Meaning that positioning today kind of becomes all important, because when these cycles move, they move quickly. And again, if a contract gets struck tomorrow, we believe wholeheartedly that it's going to happen at a price that is maybe 50%, 75%, 100% higher at a minimum, to spot prices, and the entire sector will likely rerate.  

The mega bull case comes if and when the market realizes that at any price, there is not enough material that can be produced from global mines and secondary supplies to fill the growing demand from the existing and growing nuclear fleet globally. And that's kind of the big picture."
14,2019-02-08,stealthVault,1,US regional banks face growing pressure to merge - Financial Times,"The biggest US bank deal since the financial crisis will heap pressure on America’s mid-sized lenders to find merger partners, industry executives, investors and analysts say.

Consolidation among the scores of US regional banks has been long predicted, but financial, regulatory and cultural realities have kept big deals at bay in the decade since the crisis. Thursday’s $66bn “merger of equals” between BB&amp;T of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Atlanta-based SunTrust changed the narrative.

“When a deal like this is done it makes everybody who is a mid-sized bank sort of sit back and say, ‘Well, what are we going to do?’” said Bill Harrison, the former JPMorgan Chase chief executive who was instrumental in the flurry of mergers that laid the foundations for that bank to become America’s largest.

The BB&amp;T-SunTrust deal, which valued both banks at their market price on the day it was struck, promises $1.6bn of cost savings by 2022. The banks also claimed that they will be able to innovate faster and compete better in the ever-changing digital banking world, a capability that resonates with peers.
“In discussions with our clients now . . . they view scale as the ability or means by which they can invest and bring their business forward,” said a senior investment banker who advises financial institutions on M&amp;A deals.

Regional bank shares rose in anticipation of action. Shares in Comerica, with $70n in assets, shot up as 5 per cent on Thursday. Huntington, a $110bn bank, rose 4 per cent as did $140bn KeyCorp. Stock prices for larger banks such as JPMorgan and Bank of America did not benefit; regulation effectively rules out mergers between the industry’s handful of national players.
A senior executive at one of the biggest US retail banks said the BB&amp;T-SunTrust combination “changes the market view of minimum efficient scale. You don’t want to be the last remaining player with sub-scale brand, data and technology.”

The deal “will probably accelerate more regionals to pursue deals to improve efficiency ratios and drive scale”, said Chad Borton, president of USAA Federal Savings Bank.
But while there is a clear impetus for other deals, bankers say an exact replica is unlikely.
SunTrust and BB&amp;T were both in a similar position of financial strength, which allowed them to structure a zero-premium deal under which BB&amp;T will buy SunTrust for $28bn in shares. That, in turn, preserved the equity value for shareholders of both companies. On the day the deal was announced, everybody won. SunTrust’s shares closed up 10 per cent and BB&amp;T’s up almost 4 per cent.
“It’s just the math,” says Anton Schutz, a small bank investor at Mendon Capital, pointing out that the deal increases the book value of BB&amp;T shares by 6 per cent, leaving both sets of shareholders better off. By contrast, he said, “When the selling shareholders win and the buyer gets punched in the face, you don’t want to own banks at all.”
Mr Schutz said he thought that other large regional banks such as US Bancorp and PNC, with assets over $200bn, would be looking for deals that are “mathematically attractive” in the same way, and looking over somewhat smaller banks such as Regions, Synovus, KeyCorp or Comerica.

Brian Klock, regional banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, said he thought that larger banks would seek out partners with overlapping regional footprints similar to the ones BB&amp;T and SunTrust share in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast. One example, he said, might be PNC and Citizens banks in the eastern US.
Another factor encouraging bank deals is the promise of lighter regulation in Donald Trump’s Washington.
In October, the Federal Reserve said in a proposed rulemaking that regulations should be “tailored” for banks with between $250bn and $750bn in assets. This would include an easing of liquidity requirements.
When it became clear rising above the $250bn threshold would not mean a drastic increase in regulation, the way was clear for a major deal. This change was particularly relevant for BB&amp;T, which has $225bn in assets.
“If you are already so close to $250bn, why not go over in a big way? You’ll have more scale, and with the ‘tailoring’ proposal your runway for growth goes all the way to $750bn,” said Mr Klock.

Perhaps more important than any particular rule, however, is a change in tone in Washington since the beginning of the Trump administration. In the last two and a half years, “banks have been saying that regulators . . . are much less combative and more co-operative — and this deal is the first tangible sign of that”, according to Stephen Scouten of Sandler O’Neill.
Bankers and analysts emphasised that the cultural barriers to consolidation might be harder to clear that either financial or regulatory ones. It is a cliché in the finance industry that banks are sold, not bought. It is hard to find a management team that is willing to give up their spots in the c-suite without being paid a premium large enough to make a deal unattractive to a buyer.
Rodgin Cohen, an M&amp;A lawyer at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, said that, in deals billed as mergers of equals, there has to be real equality in the deal terms so that neither side is paying a premium. “That means, by definition, that no one gets everything they want.” This makes such deals hard: “It takes two CEOs who are willing to put their egos aside.”

In the case of the BB&amp;T-SunTrust deal, the two chief executives will take turns leading the combined bank. If all goes according to plan, Kelly King of BB&amp;T, the older of the two, will serve as chairman and chief executive until late 2021, after which the roles will shift to William Rogers of SunTrust. Similarly, the combined bank will not carry the name of either predecessor (a new name has not been chosen yet) and the headquarters will be in the neutral territory of Charlotte, North Carolina.
None of this is easy, and Mr Cohen said that the tie-up will cause “acceleration of thinking about [similar] deals, and accelerate conversations, but whether it leads to actual deals — we will have to see”.
Mr Harrison, who worked on eight bank deals before he retired in 2004, said some chief executives might be discouraged from M&amp;A because of the inevitable difficulties and uncertainties.
“It’s really hard trying to bring all of these different cultures and people together to create a scenario where one plus one is greater than two,” said Mr Harrison, adding that, “If you don’t do that, you shouldn’t have done the merger”.

The prospect of a succession of deals that reduce America’s 4,500-plus banks down to a few hundred is remote. “I don’t think in the post-crisis environment you can be a serial acquirer any more, not with things of size that matter,” said the senior bank adviser.
Mr Harrison said that while the BB&amp;T-SunTrust deal could ultimately pave the way for the creation of a another big national bank, “it would be challenging for them to do another deal for two or three or four more years” given how long it takes to integrate operations.
“It will take some time through the consolidation process with the small- to mid-sized banks to create another big national player,” he said, “but it is the beginning of a process . . . We should have more consolidation.”

15,2019-02-04,VersalEszett,1,Big Tech Is No Longer Carrying the Stock Market,"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/business/dealbook/stock-market-technology.html

&gt; For much of the past decade, the fate of the stock market has been tied to the performance of a handful of the largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix led the market from one record to the next.

&gt; By the end of August, their sway over the direction of the S&amp;P 500 exceeded all but two of the index’s 11 sector groupings. As the index pushed to a record high last summer, the rise in those six companies’ shares accounted for half of its gain. They led on the way down too, dragging the broader market lower over the final three months of 2018 and nearly ending the longest bull market on record.

&gt; So it’s notable, then, that as the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 8 percent in January, the big technology stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the benchmark’s rise, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices."

It led me to recently do some analysis that I wanted to share with you all. 

I looked at three basic scenarios: aggressive: all-in on stocks, safe: all-in on money market, re-balance: if stocks have a good year sell, if they have a bad year buy. I took S&amp;P 500 data since 1870 to do both monte carlo as well as back-testing on the strategies. And the results:

\- if you expect the ten year average annualized return to be between 0 and 4.5%, then continue to re-balance.

\- if you expect the ten year average annualized return to be less than 0, then play it safe

\- ""                                                                                          "" to be greater that 4.5%, then just go all-in on VTX

So, I plan to bite the bullet and start moving the stock pile into the market. The question I have is, have any of you done this type of analysis that includes world markets (VT data, MSCI data, etc.). Does it make sense to go all-in on VTX or maybe instead do a CAPE based selection of countries that may outperform or just go into good-old VT?

Either way, you wouldn’t be on this page wondering how to get really rich with your own business. No worries, here you’ll realize what things you can do with the money amount already available in your pocket.

We’ve already seen in [our article](https://blog.s-pro.io/invest-money-business-become-millionaire/) what options are there for you when your goal is to earn some interest. Even more, those methods over time can bring really inspiring results for everyone. [In this piece of work](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-invest-money-business/), I've concentrated more on the last specified option – business. There are many reasons for that. Probably the most important one is that business can bring the biggest revenue out of all other investment options.

## What are the most profitable businesses?

There are uncountable possibilities in every niche. Just check out the empty cells in the Startup Matrix we already described in [our post](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-brainstorm-new-startup-ideas-the-startup-idea-matrix/). We can start listing the actual spheres that are in need of fresh new ideas. But to be of more help to you we better concentrate on the directions in businesses that can be applied to almost every business niche.

What unites every other direction is technology. It has already changed the way all businesses function around the world. There more or less progress here or there, but it is definitely the biggest trend nowadays.

Entrepreneurs are stepping into the tech world with joy because it has already proven the positive effect that tech inclusions do with businesses by scaling them with ease.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning will take away manual operations transforming the way industries will work within just a few years.

### Online business

People are getting more aware of the benefits of online transactions, communication systems and other online platforms offer. Have you considered how much more convenient it is to use contactless payments?

There were many challenges that online businesses have already overcome and continue successfully dealing with nowadays.

### Artificial Intelligence

There have been many debates around AI for years. Nowadays it gets more and more popular and is expected to bring new products with [AI implemented](https://blog.s-pro.io/ai-driven-development-as-an-innovative-market-tendency/) in 2019 and further years.

With AI data analytics will be on hype as artificial intelligence operates with behavioral data of each user.

### Blockchain

Even though the hype around blockchain has been decreased lately, it still has great potential in [transforming all the business niches and everyone’s lives](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-change-the-world-for-the-better-or-our-utopian-future-with-blockchain/).

These are just a few major trends that will rule the business world and continue to be implemented in all areas of our lives. The core feature that unites all of them is an online presence. The mobility it gives to consumers is much appreciated by them. People are getting to feel the benefits of not be tied up to a certain location.

What comes to your mind when you think about mobility? Possibly mobile devices and the growing number of various mobile applications already implemented and growing. The thing is all the mentioned trends can be implemented in businesses via web and mobile applications.

20,2019-05-08,BroadShoulders07,1,Zelle of Food Delivery Apps,"What’s everyone’s experiences with food delivery apps like Uber Eats/Grubhub/Doordash/etc.? 

I’ve had inconsistent experiences where at times food has been delivered that was cold due to lack of coordination b/w driver and restaurant. Drivers can pickup orders from multiple restaurants prior to delivery which might be one of the issues.

I think this is an interesting issue and one that is a potential negative to restaurants who seem to be joining these services left and right.

First and foremost the restaurant loses a step in the quality control process by outsourcing the delivery. Second, they lose out on customer data by allowing these services to control the marketplace.

I would be interested to see some of the big chains team up to create a marketplace that allows them to retain control of the delivery process essentially what the big banks have done with Zelle. 

Anyone have any thoughts on this?"
21,2019-05-07,BeeProblems999,1,100 year historical data with dividends?,"I have seen some fear mongering posts about how bad it has been at times to invest.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this seems to ignore dividends which were [rather large back then](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend-yield/table/by-year) (5-10%). I am really curious if you invested ""in the market"" at the absolute worst time in 1929 how long it actually would have taken to return to neutral. I realize the S&amp;P was not as big of a thing back then but any broad based market (with dividends factored in) would be interesting.

22,2019-05-06,blingblingmofo,127,Today's Startup Bubble Versus 1999 - The Information,"I recently saw a post here asking about today's IPOs versus 1999. This was published in The Information's Newsletter and lays out some of the key differences:



**Party Like It’s 1999**

If there has been one way to get laughed out of a room in Silicon Valley these past few years, it is to draw comparisons between the present day and the frothy late 90s.

Do so, and you are likely to get a lecture on all the reasons why the current tech “boom” in no way resembles the tech “bubble” that burst nearly two decades ago. For starters, today’s tech companies are global behemoths with orders of magnitude more revenue than flameouts like Pets.com. We aren’t seeing the same run-up in IPO prices that we did during the late 90s. Tech, media and telecom stocks represent about 32% of the S&amp;P vs. 45% in early 2000.

2019 is not 1999. But there is no doubt we are in a different bubble of sorts, and it’s time we recognized it. Because, while today’s tech companies don’t face the same risk of simply vanishing, they are burning through incredible amounts of cash, often with a story, but no evidence, about how they can reach profitability. The idea that SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, the one perpetuating these losses by funneling capital into money-losing companies before they go public, might itself go public without yet seeing stable returns on its investments is alarming.

Today’s newly public tech companies have a lot of runway because they have raised billions in the private markets and are raising big sums through their IPOs too. With interest rates now stabilizing, the market has bounced back; the party could continue for a little while.

But even so, we're in dangerous times. Any macro economic event could undermine confidence and bring everything tumbling down. And it’s hard to estimate how long companies’ cash will last when many are burning more year over year. Businesses are going to have to adjust their business models and cost structures dramatically, and some investors will suffer.

Uber spent $2 billion more in cash last year than it took in in revenue. Lyft burned through $980 million. Yet investors are valuing Lyft at seven times 2018 revenue. If Uber goes public around $81 billion, it will be valued at slightly more than seven times.

While those multiples aren’t crazy, they are risky for companies that are far more capital intensive than traditional tech companies.

That’s especially true of WeWork, which publicly announced its IPO preparations were well underway this week. The company last year lost more than it took in in total revenue—with a net loss of $1.9 billion on $1.8 billion in revenue. That is some serious money.

In some cases, the companies would like investors to believe that their losses can be erased quickly when they “decide” to become profitable and stop competing for market share. The only problem with that theory—which Uber, Lyft and their investors have been saying for the better part of a decade—is that the companies aren’t supporting it with any data. Many businesses remain races to the bottom with thin margins. Just ask the airline industry.

It’s not like growth is going gangbusters either. Uber’s ride-hailing business grew revenue 33% last year, down from 95% growth the year before. Revenues for Uber Eats, the supposed fast-growing second business for Uber, fell between quarters in 2018. Airbnb, which is expected to go public later this year or early next, has told investors that it conservatively expects to grow revenue 25% this year, down from 42% last year, Cory reported recently.

Even the profitable exceptions bear closer scrutiny. The team at Zoom has managed to grow what is a pretty basic video-conferencing feature to $330.5 million in revenue. But folks, it is still video conferencing, which is highly competitive and somewhat of a commodity. Its market cap is two-thirds the value of Twitter.

Perhaps some of these fears are already lowering expectations. Lyft is trading 13% below its IPO price. Remember when Uber was expected to go public at a valuation of $120 billion, according to what people close to the company leaked to the press? When the moment finally comes, expected at the end of next week, it is looking like it will be closer to $81 billion.

Indeed, it is starting to feel like this rush of IPOs is being fueled more by fear that the money is going to dry up than by the sense that they are strong enough to face the scrutiny of being public companies.

And that is never a good sign."
23,2019-05-04,EmmaWatsonsButt,29,Microsoft.,"Microsoft, imo, is still an undervalued stock, and I genuinely believe Buffett would be buying it had his relationship with Gates not be so close to create a conflict of interest. Microsoft is the fastest growing company in cloud computing, and they have the distinct advantage of not being Amazon, the player competing with everyone. 

Microsoft HoloLens, GitHub, LinkedIn, Surface lineup, Xbox, Minecraft, Office 360 subscriptions, even Windows, all of these are solid brands with real growth and impressive revenue streams. 

Satya Nadella is to Microsoft what Bob Iger is to Disney: a CEO so impressive, people are saying he has done as much if not more for the company than the founder. Nadella pivoted Microsoft into cloud computing years ago, later than Amazon but sooner than Google, and to me that shows a real vision for the company, ditching the name Microsoft Windows Azure for Microsoft Azure, not banking on the previous success of the Windows software. Satya Nadella also wrote off Nokia, which cost billions in the short term but would've been a wasteful quagmire trying to compete with Android and iOS.

Personally, I love my Surface Go, and my iPad felt like an iPhone with a bloated screen size. I think that while Apple goes mainstream, Microsoft will become the cool brand, especially with lines like Surface Studio. Office 365 has 155 million active users, and apps like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel continue to blow away the competition.

Microsoft is the best in b2b, and really good in b2c. My motivation to put my amateur analysis out there is because I find it disingenous for the second largest cloud computing company to be called a lacking innovator, as Scott Galloway claims as to why he doesn't include the company in his ""Big 4"" of disruptive tech companies. I also don't find it genuine that Microsoft is not lumped together with FAANG considering Microsoft has consistently outperformed every single company on there and is nearing a $1 trillion market cap. Plus that acronym was supposed to be about good tech companies to work for, and Amazon doesn't lavish their coders like Google and Facebook do, so that doesn't even make sense to begin with. 

Microsoft is legit, and with rapidly increasing business in cloud computing, virtual technology with HoloLens, as well as a legacy of staying in the top 10 most valuable companies for the past 30 years, I honestly predict Microsoft's best days are ahead of it. Not to mention the long term political implications of people voting with their wallets, and Microsoft fostering a brand of long term sustainability with a positive relationship in Seattle as well as not getting into the news for exploiting workers, data breaches, and other nefarious behavior."

It's all about the prevalence of millions of fake local business listings on Google Maps.  With the pending DOJ anti-trust investigation into Google's ad dominance, this article is a pretty timely look into the prominence of Google in local listings (Google Maps), which gives the DOJ more ammunition in a potential case against Google...ie, it's not just the lack of competition in advertising and ability for Google to favor its own products, but it's also the heavy reliance that local businesses often have on Google: “It’s less harmful to piss off the government than piss off Google,” Mr. Abuhazim said.

I think most people believe regulatory risk to these Internet giants is low (I also believe the absolute risk is low), but this is the existential threat that investors need to focus on in my humble opinion.

**Millions of Business Listings on Google Maps Are Fake—and Google Profits**

Out of habit, Nancy Carter, a retired federal employee, turned to Google for help one August evening. She ended the night wishing she hadn’t.

Ms. Carter had pulled into her Falls Church, Va., driveway and saw the garage door was stuck. The 67-year-old searched Google and found the listing of a local repair service she had used before. She phoned in a house call.

Google’s ubiquitous internet platform shapes what’s real and what isn’t for more than two billion monthly users. Yet Google Maps, triggered by such Google queries as the one Ms. Carter made, is overrun with millions of false business addresses and fake names, according to advertisers, search experts and current and former Google employees.

The ruse lures the unsuspecting to what appear to be Google-suggested local businesses, a costly and dangerous deception.

A man arrived at Ms. Carter’s home in an unmarked van and said he was a company contractor. He wasn’t. After working on the garage door, he asked for $728, nearly twice the cost of previous repairs, Ms. Carter said. He demanded cash or a personal check, but she refused. “I’m at my house by myself with this guy,” she said. “He could have knocked me over dead.”

The repairman had hijacked the name of a legitimate business on Google Maps and listed his own phone number. He returned to Ms. Carter’s home again and again, hounding her for payment on a repair so shoddy it had to be redone.

Three years later, Google still can’t seem to stop the proliferation of fictional business listings and aggressive con artists on its search engine. The scams are profitable for nearly everyone involved, Google included. Consumers and legitimate businesses end up the losers.

Google handles more than 90% of the world’s online search queries, fueling $116 billion in advertising revenue last year. In recent years, it has extended that dominance to local search queries, emerging as the go-to source on everything from late-night food deliveries to best neighborhood plumbers.

Yet despite its powerful algorithms and first-rate software engineers, the company struggles to protect against chronic deceit on Google Maps.

Once considered a sleepy, low-margin business by the company and known mostly for giving travel directions, Google Maps in recent months has packed more ads onto its search queries. It is central to Google parent [Alphabet](https://quotes.wsj.com/GOOG) Inc.’s [GOOG **0.94%** ](https://quotes.wsj.com/GOOG?mod=chiclets)hope to recharge a cresting digital-advertising operation.

Often, Google Maps yields mirages, visible in local business searches of U.S. cities, including Mountain View, Calif., Google’s hometown. Of a dozen addresses for personal-injury attorneys on Google Maps during a recent search, only one office was real. A Viennese patisserie was among the businesses at addresses purported to house lawyers. The fakes vanished after inquiries to Google from The Wall Street Journal.

The false listings benefit businesses seeking more customer calls by sprinkling made-up branches in various corners of a city. In other cases, as Ms. Carter discovered, calls to listed phone numbers connect to unscrupulous competitors, a misdirection forbidden by Google rules but sporadically policed by the company.

Hundreds of thousands of false listings sprout on Google Maps each month, according to experts. Google says it catches many others before they appear.

The Justice Department is laying the groundwork for [a broad antitrust probe of Google](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-gets-ready-for-legal-fight-as-u-s-weighs-an-antitrust-probe-11559521581?mod=article_inline), which will include a look at the company’s dominant advertising platform, the Journal has reported. Competitors have complained to antitrust enforcers that Google’s expansion into local searches is an example of anticompetitive behavior. A Justice spokesman declined to comment.

Google holds 37% of the U.S. digital ad market, according to researcher eMarketer, though its share is falling to [Facebook](https://quotes.wsj.com/FB) , [Amazon.com](https://quotes.wsj.com/AMZN) Inc. and others.

Online advertising specialists identified by Google as deft fraud fighters estimated that Google Maps carries roughly 11 million falsely listed businesses on any given day, according to a Journal survey of these experts.

#### They say a majority of the listings for contractors, electricians, towing and car repair services, movers and lawyers, among other business categories, aren’t located at their pushpins on Google Maps. Shams among these service categories, called “duress verticals” inside Google, can snag people at their most vulnerable.

Google wouldn’t provide its own figure, but the company said false map listings are a small percentage of the total. [The company paid ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286?mod=article_inline)for a [2017 academic study ](http://papers.www2017.com.au.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/proceedings/p1471.pdf?mod=article_inline)by researchers at the University of California, San Diego, which concluded 0.5% of local searches they examined had yielded spurious results.

Search consultant Michael Blumenthal, of Olean, N.Y., said the study was “totally bogus and meaningless,” in part because Google provided limited data and diluted the study with listings for restaurants, hotels and other business that rarely post false locations.

The study’s lead author, Danny Huang, said he was a paid Google intern while preparing the research paper. “All I was doing was eyeballing in a scientific manner,” he said.

Google Maps director Ethan Russell said in a written statement, “There is no single source of truth for all businesses in all categories.”

###### Wanted: Plumber

Type a search query and Google will post at the top of the screen as many as six businesses that bought Google ads. The adjacent map that pops up is supposed to pinpoint bricks-and-mortar businesses in the neighborhood.

A search for plumbers in a swath of New York City found 13 false addresses out of the top 20 Google search results. Only two of the 20 are located where they say and accept customers at their listed addresses, requirements for pushpin listings on Google Maps.

The business is located where it says but doesn't accept customers at the listed address, a violation of Google guidelines.

Businesses aren't located where their Google Maps listing says. Some phone numbers are routed to call centers or to different plumbers.

Google Street View, as well as visits and phone calls by the Journal, revealed the deception. These businesses were given an opportunity to dispute the Journal findings about their location.

Mr. Russell, of Google, said the company removed more than three million false business listings in 2018. The company last year also disabled 150,000 accounts that uploaded the made-up listings, he said, up 50% from 2017. Google didn’t detail its countermeasures, citing security.

A Google spokeswoman said the company wasn’t previously aware of some high-risk business categories, including water-damage repair and home listings. Google added new defenses for those businesses after questions about false listings from the Journal, the spokeswoman said.

Any storefront business can register to appear on Google Maps without buying an advertisement. Yet many legitimate businesses find that the best way to stay ahead of the phonies is to buy ads from Google.

“I don’t think Google is specifically trying to profit, but at the same time they are profiting,” said Molly Youngblood, a digital-marketing consultant from Jacksonville, Fla. Some of her clients turned to her after getting pushed from the top of Google search results by false business listings.

Google’s failure to eliminate phony listings puts legitimate businesses at the risk of threats and blackmail by competitors or con artists.

Anas Abuhazim, who runs a cash-for-junk-cars operation in the Chicago suburbs, learned firsthand. His two businesses, Smart Tow Inc. and Cash for Junk Cars LLC, field calls from people looking to dump useless vehicles. His phone operators offer callers around $300 for their wrecks and retrieval within an hour. That leaves Mr. Abuhazim reliant on Google searches.

Every morning, seven days a week, Mr. Abuhazim stuffs an envelope with thousands of dollars to swap for cars, which he mostly sells for parts. Mr. Abuhazim, 35, used to buy ads in the Yellow Pages until Google came along.

Last year, he was approached by a marketing firm that offered to lift his business listings on Google Maps for a fee in the tens of thousands of dollars.

Mr. Abuhazim agreed to the deal. In March, he said, the marketing firm tightened the screws: Hand over half your revenue or else. The firm threatened to bury Mr. Abuhazim’s Google listings under hundreds of fictional competitors unless he agreed to the onerous terms.

Mr. Abuhazim refused, and the agency carried out its threat. It unleashed an avalanche of new listings under such names as “Chicago Auto Brokers.”

On a recent drive to visit junkyards around the Chicago suburbs, Mr. Abuhazim searched Google on his phone for local competitors. It was easy to see that more than half the search results were fake, he said.

Mr. Abuhazim tried reaching Google to explain his dilemma, but he was repeatedly routed to an offshore call center. Operators, he said, “treated me like I’m stupid.” With his businesses pushed off the first page of Google Maps results, incoming calls halved. He said he was on the verge of closing.

Google cleared away some of the false listings after the Journal inquired about Mr. Abuhazim’s situation.

“It’s less harmful to piss off the government than piss off Google,” Mr. Abuhazim said. “The government will hit me with a fine. But if Google suspends my listings, I’m out of a job. Google could make me homeless.”

Advertisers of all sizes compete in Google auctions to appear alongside words that potential customers are likely to use in a Google search. Firms pay Google for every click generated by those words.

Prices in business categories that Google has identified as ripe for ad fraud—specialized attorneys, for instance—have risen more than 50% in the past two years. Some law firms pay more than $1,000 for every customer who clicks on their website from a Google search.

Before a business appears on its maps, Google typically mails a postcard, phones or sends an email to the firm with a numerical code that must be entered into a Google website. The check system is one way to subvert automated programs that can generate scores of false businesses.

Google’s fraud filters sometimes ensnare legitimate businesses, freezing them out until they prove they are real.

Google Maps in March dropped all six offices of personal injury attorney Ian Silverthorne for unspecified “quality issues,” he said. Out of suspicion, he searched Google and counted 108 suspect listings in and around Orange County, Calif., where Mr. Silverthorne has an office.

He started calling the listings, he said, and found they went to a competitor, Oakwood Legal Group LLP, which operates a single Orange County office. Oakwood didn’t respond to requests for comment.

To be reinstated on Google Maps, Google asked Mr. Silverthorne to send videos from his phone that showed him in his various law offices. After inquiries from the Journal, Google reinstated his listings.

“There will be times we get it wrong,” said Mr. Russell, of Google.

###### ‘A nightmare’

Google said it has long battled phantom business listings.

For the past decade, the company has hosted around a dozen volunteers each fall who patrol its pages for forgeries. This digital version of a Neighborhood Watch group, which includes advertising specialists trained by Google, stays at a motel near the corporate campus, dining on egg whites, from cage-free chickens, and other free offerings at company cafeterias.

Mr. Blumenthal, the New York search consultant, has joined several of the annual visits, which are billed as educational trips. He learned, he said, that Google “has obviously chosen not to solve the problem.” He skipped last year’s junket.

Search-engine consultant Andy Kuiper reported on a Google online forum last fall about a string of bogus appliance businesses popping up in searches around his hometown of Edmonton, Alberta. His post triggered anonymous, threatening emails.

“You’ve made a big mistake,” said one email writer, claiming to be from Eastern Europe. “We can play forever.” Another read: “I have an army of Indian guys that can turn your life into a nightmare.”

Afterward, negative reviews rapidly spread in listings for Mr. Kuiper and his clients. After Mr. Kuiper contacted Google, the internet giant blocked all reviews of his work, including legitimate ones, cramping his business.

“Did they find out who this guy was?” Mr. Kuiper said. “I don’t think so.”

The Google spokeswoman said only that the email address sending the threats was suspended. Mr. Kuiper’s reviews were blocked because of what she described as unrelated defensive efforts.

Google is in “an arms race with an extremely motivated group of scammers who are constantly on the lookout to beat the defenses we build,” Mr. Russell, the Google Maps director, said in his statement.

One prolific listings merchant is Mark Luckenbaugh. From a basement smelling of cigarette smoke in Hanover, Pa., he runs a business that can place as many as 3,800 fake Google Maps listings a day.

A self-described high-school dropout, Mr. Luckenbaugh manages 11 people who, he said, “mostly” follow Google rules to help clients get better visibility on Google Maps. A separate staff of 25 in the Philippines employs unsanctioned methods to fill orders for fake listings, he said.

“I’m not going to sit and act like I’m a saint,” Mr. Luckenbaugh said. “But I’m not sure you could say I’m a sinner either.”

Mr. Luckenbaugh charges $99 for a single made-up listing and up to $8,599 for a 100-pack. The listings are aimed at businesses that want to pepper Google Maps with faux locations to generate more customer calls. Subverting Google’s verification system, he said, wasn’t hard.

His employees submit fake business listings to Google, scraping real addresses from commercial real-estate listings and creating such search-friendly names as best personal injury attorney. He also buys phone numbers, available cheap online, to attach to the listings.

When Google automatically calls the newly purchased numbers, Mr. Luckenbaugh’s employees retrieve the code to activate the listing. The Google Maps pushpins appear soon after. The listed phone numbers can be routed to Mr. Luckenbaugh’s clients.

“I know Google knows,” Mr. Luckenbaugh said. The method leaves “a huge footprint, and they’re just letting it happen,” he added.

The Google spokeswoman said the company was investigating Mr. Luckenbaugh’s operation.

Mr. Luckenbaugh said tens of thousands of the listings have since disappeared."
28,2019-06-21,unab0mber,22,Reading between the lines: What Slack didn’t disclose in its IPO filing," 

Slack Technologies, the developer of the popular namesake team collaboration messaging app, recently [applied](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8) for a public offering on the stock market. This is not a classic IPO, but a “direct listing,” also known a “direct public offering.” This means Slack is not raising money by directly selling shares and instead allows early investors and employees to sell their shares in the public offering. Music streaming service Spotify held a successful direct listing last year.

This story caught my attention for a simple reason. In August 2016, I joined the team developing a still-undercover product called Workplace by Facebook—a direct competitor to Slack. I worked on the product for 2.5 years. Back then, I dreamed of having an opportunity to look inside Slack’s business metrics.

It may seem that Slack has revealed a lot of data about the business in their [S-1 filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.htm#sA031AD7407DEE4C9AD8C567D8A577EE8), a document that is almost 200 pages in length.

The reality is, they haven’t. The company had already disclosed in various ways much of the information compiled in their report.

But if we combine the data disclosed in S-1 filing and the experience I gained while working on Slack’s competitor, we’ll be able to uncover interesting details that will paint a more holistic picture.

I must say that this article contains my personal thoughts on the matter, jotted down while going through their S-1 filing, and should not be considered as investment advice.

**If you want to learn how to use data to build and grow products, then take a look at** [**Simulator**](https://gopractice.io/) **(an educational product by Go Practice).**

## Slack’s top-level business metrics

* Slack doubles its revenue every year: $105.1M, $220.5M, $400.5M (respectively from 2016, 2017, 2019).
* Gross margin remains at the level of 87-88%. This doesn’t sound bad at all, although it isn’t unexpected from a fully digital product that costs several times more than its direct competitors.
* There is a lot of talk in the press about Slack’s unprofitability; the company shows a net loss of about $140M per year. But if we take a look at the cost structure and growth drivers (we’ll get to this later), then the losses won’t look like a problem. You can read more about this [here](https://tomtunguz.com/slack-s-1-analysis/).
* Slack estimates the market opportunity of workplace business technology software communication platforms at $28B per year. My own evaluation of the market stands at about the same number.
* Slack’s S-1 reminds us of the true costs of venture capital. The founders are left with 8.6% and 3.4% of the company. Meanwhile, the biggest shareholders are VC firms Accel Partners (24%), Andreessen Horowitz (13.3%), and Softbank (7.3%).

## Number of free and paid Slack customers

* Approximately 588,000 organizations use Slack.
* However, the concept of “organization” is rather vague in the report: “We define an organization on Slack as a separate entity, such as a company, educational or government institution, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a subscription plan, whether free or paid. Once an organization has three or more users on a paid subscription plan, we count them as a Paid Customer.” So, if there are 15 IBM teams using Slack, does it count as one organization or 15? It’s not clear.
* 88,000 of these organizations are paid customers, and over 500,000 organizations use Slack’s free subscription plan.
* Therefore, 15% of the active organizations are paying for the service. But this doesn’t give us a lot of information. Imagine 100 new companies register with Slack, but 99 of them stop using it after a while, and one remaining company purchases one of Slack’s paid plans. In this case we can say 100% of active companies are paid customers. But looking at it from a different perspective, only 1% of new companies become paid customers.
* My assessment of a long-term retention rate from a new organization into an active one for Slack is 5–10%. This is a very rough estimate. Moreover, long-term retention rates differ greatly depending on industry and acquisition channel.
* This estimation is based on my personal experience and the following quote from an old [interview](https://firstround.com/review/From-0-to-1B-Slacks-Founder-Shares-Their-Epic-Launch-Strategy/) with Slack’s founder: “Most people who fill out the form and hit submit — more than 90% — never invite anyone or start using the software.”
* If this estimation is correct, then 588,000 active organizations indicate that 5.5–11 million new organizations joined Slack over the service’s entire lifetime. This means that Slack gets about 115-230k new leads per month.
* If the estimate of the total number of organizations is correct, then the conversion rate from a new organization into a long-term paying customer stands at around 0.8-1.6%. If we factor in the average churn for SaaS (approx. 50% of new customer will churn over the first year), then the conversion rate from a new organization signing up with Slack into the one that pays at least once will stand at around 1.5-3.5%.
* In many ways, Slack’s cleverness is hidden behind its strong brand and a huge flow of new organic leads. We will talk about it further on.

## Slack’s user engagement

* Slack’s DAU stays at around 10 million users (these are the users who either created or consumed content in the service at least once in 24 hours). The dynamics of DAU looks impressive.
* Slack had previously revealed its overall DAU and DAU of its paying users. But in the S-1 filing, it only mentions the overall DAU. This might signal that the growth of paying users has slowed down. Overall revenue growth is being pulled out by raising prices through the introduction of new tariffs and Slack for Enterprise taking a greater share of the revenue of the service.
* More than 1 billion messages are sent via Slack every week. This means that the average active user sends 14 messages per day. This is a good level of user engagement, but it’s not extraordinary or impressive.
* An average active user spends 42 minutes per day in the service. In comparison, active paid users spend an average 90 minutes in Slack per working day. These numbers don’t look bad. But when compared to the average 14 messages sent per user, they look dubious.
* The big question is, how does Slack calculate time spent in the product? A few years ago, they simply looked at the time the service was active on users’ devices. That has changed, but the company mentions no specific methodology in their filing, which makes it difficult to interpret the numbers.

## Slack’s business model

Even without a report, Slack’s business model seems obvious, but the company laid it out eloquently in the filing:

“We offer a self-service approach, for both free and paid subscriptions to Slack, which capitalizes on strong word-of-mouth adoption and customer love for our brand. Since 2016, we have augmented our approach with a direct sales force and customer success professionals who are focused on driving successful adoption and expansion within organizations, whether on a free or paid subscription plan.”

Here are the key points:

* Slack gets most new customers organically through word-of-mouth(self-serve model).
* Some of the new organizations convert into paying customers.
* The sales team works with leads that qualify as large organizations.
* The goal of the sales team is to increase Slack’s penetration within large organizations.

Let us now reflect on some of these points in more detail.

## The top of Slack’s funnel is driven by organic signups from word-of-mouth

“We offer a self-service approach, for both free and paid subscriptions to Slack, which capitalizes on strong word-of-mouth adoption and customer love for our brand.”

The first question that occurs after reading this sentence is, why doesn’t Slack accelerate growth by investing in acquisition through paid ad channels? It isn’t hard to verify that Slack almost doesn’t invest in Google Ads or Facebook Ads (there are some paid ads, but they’re mostly focused on branded search).

Here’s the short answer: The SMB (small and medium-sized business) segment’s economics doesn’t justify paying for ads because the return on investment is negative (ROI &lt; 0). Meanwhile, direct advertising channels don’t work for the enterprise segment. 

Now here’s a more detailed answer:

* The average cheque for Slack’s paying customers is $380 per month.
* If we ignore companies that Slack considers as enterprise customers (with more than $100k ARR), then the average cheque per month will be $230, and the average organization’s size will be 40 people.
* Thus, a self-serve client brings \~$2,760 in revenue in the first year and \~$2,400 in gross profit in the first year.
* If the goal is to get a positive return on investment (ROI) within 12 months, then, then a long-term paying client should cost $2,400 in the self-serve segment.
* With a 0.8-1.6% conversion rate into a long-term paying customer, a new organization should cost $20-40.
* But in B2B, leads from organic channels usually demonstrate 2-4 times better metrics than the leads from paid advertising channels. Let’s assume that in the case of Slack, the difference is 2x. This means in order to get ROI &gt; 0, Slack needs to acquire new organizations at a cost of $10-20.
* This looks unrealistic if we consider the economics of paid advertising channels in developed markets, where the average cost of a new organization from Google Ads or Facebook Ads will be around $100-200.
* That’s why Slack invests nearly nothing in paid acquisition. It grows mainly through strong brand, word-of-mouth, integrations with other services and the subsequent cross-promos, the professional communities in Slack and tools for communication between companies.

On the one hand, Slack is shielded from competitors because it has a huge number of organic leads and due to the fact that paid acquisition doesn’t work in the market, it is nearly impossible to get close to Slack in the self-serve segment.

On the other hand, as you will soon see, the self-serve segment acts as a gateway to reach enterprise customers. But Slack’s competitors have other ways to reach these companies.

## Net Dollar Retention Rate is the most interesting piece of data Slack revealed

The following chart shows the growth of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) by cohorts based on the year when organizations first paid for using Slack.

ARR from organizations that first paid for Slack in 2015 continues to grow steadily in the following years.

For most products, cohorts shrink as they age. But in Slack’s case, we’re witnessing the opposite (this is also called Negative Revenue Churn). This is one of the main reasons why Slack is worth so much ($7B valuation at the latest funding round, $10B proposed valuation for the public offering).

&amp;#x200B;

However, it is worth noting that such growth patterns are typical for products in this kind of market. Zoom, which recently went public, has a Net Dollar Retention of 140%. Twilio and Atlassian showed even more impressive figures at the time of their IPO ([source](https://tomtunguz.com/slack-s-1-analysis/)).

&amp;#x200B;

The following are the main growth drivers:

* Expansion of the user base within companies that are already using the service: Slack is building up their sales team, which reaches out to companies that have already started using Slack, and does everything to get the remaining employees to switch to the service.
* The organic growth of customers: Companies that have started using Slack are hiring new employees and growing in size. More employees -&gt; more Slack users -&gt; Slack gets more money.
* Price changes: Slack raises prices directly or by introducing new tariff plans.

An interesting consequence here is that Slack’s growth depends more on how the team is developing the product and the growth of its current customers than on attracting new users and converting them into paying ones.

Acquisition, of course, is just as much important, but it has a rather delayed impact on the overall revenue growth.

Another consequence is that such growth mechanism depends greatly on having enough enterprise customers with many employees who have not yet started using Slack (it will be difficult to grow revenue from of old cohorts if all of them are SMBs with 40 employees).

If you look at the growth of new paying customers, it doesn’t look promising. Slack added 22,000 paying customers in 2017 and 29,000 in 2018. This is a 30% increase in new paying clients, but still not the kind of dynamics Slack would like to see.

Therefore, the main driver of Slack’s exponential revenue growth is the expansion of cash flow from its old customers.

Slack measures this process using the Net Dollar Retention Rate metric: They take all the customers who were already paying 12 months ago. They then divide the current MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) by the MRR for the previous 12 months.

Net Dollar Retention Rate for the last three years looks like this: 171%, 152%, 143%. That is, customers who paid a year ago pay much more in the following year. Which is fantastic. Net Dollar Retention Rate is gradually decreasing, but this is expectable due to the slowdown of growth in old cohorts.

Here’s what Slack’s report says about this:

“We disclose Net Dollar Retention Rate as a supplemental measure of our organic revenue growth. We believe Net Dollar Retention Rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain, and grow revenue from, our Paid Customers.

We calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the MRR from all Paid Customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or Prior Period MRR. We then calculate the MRR from these same Paid Customers as of the current period end, or Current Period MRR. Current Period MRR includes expansion within Paid Customers and is net of contraction or attrition over the trailing twelve months, but excludes revenue from new Paid Customers in the current period, including those organizations that were only on Free subscription plans in the prior period and converted to paid subscription plans during the current period. We then divide the total Current Period MRR by the total Prior Period MRR to arrive at our Net Dollar Retention Rate.”

## Enterprise is a problematic segment for Slack

If you have enough patience to go through the entire 200-page report, you will notice Slack repeatedly showcasing its success in the enterprise segment. This segment accounts for a significant part of the market ($28 billion spent on communication tools each year), and this is what Slack is striving for. This is the where their long-term growth lies and where they are getting Net dollar retention rate &gt; 100%.

Here’s what the report says about this segment:

* Customers should have ARR &gt; 100k to be considered enterprise customers.
* The number of enterprise clients in the past three years: 135, 298, 575
* The revenue share of the Enterprise segment in the past three years: 22%, 32%, 40%
* Revenue from enterprise customers over the past three years: $23M, $70.5M, $160.2M
* Average monthly spending by enterprise customers in the past three years: $14,200, $19,700, $23,200
* The largest customers have “tens of thousands of employees” or tens of thousands of active users per day—quite an ambiguous wording (“our largest Paid Customers have tens of thousands of employees using Slack on a daily basis”).
* For the last two years, almost all of the Slack product releases have been aimed at adapting the product to large organizations. Take for example Slack Enterprise Grid, adding Threads, Unread section.

At first glance, it does look impressive. But let’s take a closer look.

* Customers should have ARR &gt; 100k to be considered enterprise customers. This means that organizations with over 1,000 employees using Slack fall into the enterprise segment. This is a rather low threshold. I assume it was chosen to get a larger absolute value of enterprise customers.
* Even with such a low threshold, Slack only has 575 enterprise clients. It is not much. Even Facebook Workplace, which entered the market much later (and doesn’t have such a phenomenal influx of organic leads), announced three months ago that it has 150 companies with more than 10,000 employees on the platform ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/facebook-says-that-workplace-now-has-2m-paying-users/)). And Teams, Microsoft’s Slack competitor, which launched even later than Workplace, has also achieved similar figures ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/teams-microsofts-slack-competitor-says-its-signed-up-over-500k-organizations-adds-whiteboard-and-live-events-support/)).
* Another way to look at 575 Enterprise customers is to compare it to the total number of organizations that have created a Slack workspace (5.5 – 11 million). Only 0.01% of them achieve enterprise status. Slack is very skewed towards the SMB segment, which suffers from a high churn rate and has very little potential for expanding revenue from its old customers.
* Major customers have tens of thousands of employees. It sounds impressive, but those who have worked with products focused on the enterprise segment know that there are many companies in the world with hundreds of thousands—and even millions—of employees (and usually they are outside the technology sector). A few examples of Facebook Workplace’s customers are Walmart, with 2.2 million employees, Starbucks with 250,000 employees, and Telenor with 37,000 employees ([source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/workplace-facebooks-enterprise-edition-snaps-up-walmart-as-a-customer/)). In terms of revenue, onboarding Walmart equates to signing up thousands of companies with 1,000 employees. This is not an attempt to say that Workplace rocks, but rather to mention that Slack finds it difficult to strike big deals.
* For the last two years, almost all of Slack’s product releases have been aimed at adapting the service to large organizations. This is true, but Slack doesn’t do it for fun. Slack loses most of its deals to competitors when trying to sign up enterprise clients, because the service works poorly for companies with over 500 employees, and even worse for companies scattered across different time zones. Synchronous communication, which is Slack’s forte, starts to falter under such conditions.
* And now regarding the blind spots that Slack was silent about in the report. The report has no clear breakdown of Slack’s customers by industry. This is an important question, since Slack initially grew in the IT and media segments. And it is unclear whether they managed to step beyond these limits, and how the product performs in more classical verticals (e.g. banking, retail, insurance, etc.). If Slack experiences problems there (as it previously has), then the market of $28B will be dramatically narrowed down to the niche of the technology business, which isn’t very impressive.

And here’s where things get really problematic for Slack:

* Microsoft already has access to a lot of large enterprise clients from all verticals and has been selling them products bundled in a single package for a long time. They recently added Microsoft Teams to the Office Suite, which is just as good as Slack in terms of functionality. Does Slack offer enough incentive to convince enterprise customers to forgo the benefits of their long-term relationship with Microsoft?
* Workplace by Facebook was originally designed for large organizations and outperforms Slack product-wise in this market segment. Moreover, Workplace works great outside the technology sector too because the product’s interface is very familiar to the masses, which means companies save a lot of money and time since they don’t need to do any employee training.

In the next 5-7 years (indeed, B2B and especially the enterprise sector are slow-paced markets with one of the longest transaction cycles) it will be thrilling to see how Slack responds to these threats and challenges.

## Summing it up

* Well done for Slack. They won over the self-serve market segment and no one even comes close to them.
* Just as much as Slack enjoys its growth in the self-serve segment, they make the best out of it using it as a source of enterprise leads for the sales team, which then spreads Slack inside large corporations.
* Slack is growing rapidly and will continue to do so in the next few years (mostly due to the expansion of revenue coming from the old cohorts). However, what happens next is still a big question.
* Slack’s long-term growth depends on how much of the enterprise segment they’ll be able to conquer, and whether they’ll be able (or perhaps they already have – this is not clear from the report) to expand beyond the segment of tech companies.

30,2019-06-17,monopolyboot10,0,It’s high time you shift from FD to Mutual funds!," Habits once formed are hard to change. Same is true with investing  habits. We have been conditioned over past many generations that  whenever we need an investment, we turn to invest in Fixed Deposits,  etc. Other investment avenues, like Mutual Funds, etc. have not found  its root yet in the Indian financial ecosystem. An therefore, it is a  fact that while there are approx. 75 crore Bank Accounts (taken as  surrogate to FD), there are only approx. 7 crore Mutual Fund accounts.

The World Bank data suggests that Indian are one of the highest saver  in the world, however when it comes to wealth creation we are not the  wealthiest nation, the roots are in our investment habits. As per  Bloomberg data while developed countries like the US, France and  Australia have more than 80% of their GDP invested in Mutual Funds,  Indians only invest about 12% of the GDP in [Mutual Funds](https://go4wealth.com/).

Is it high time and right time to shift to Mutual Funds?

Let’s consider some facts:

* Average expected life-span is increasing for Indians, currently  it is around 70 years. That means, even when people stop working, they  have around 20-30 years of life to fund. You need a big corpus to be  created by the time you retire.
* Goal based expenses may not be  there now, but as life progresses there are bevy of financial goals,  like home, retirement, children education, children marriage, etc. that  you need to plan for
* Average long term inflation is in the range  of 5 – 7%, and your FD gives you return of 7 – 8%, so in effect you are  getting an inflation adjusted return of 1 – 2 %. Wealth Creation does  not happen at this pace.
* Equity Mutual Funds have historically  given 14 – 18% annualized return in past 3- 10 years. Some funds have  given returns as high as 25 – 28% annualized
* Mutual Funds are  highly liquid, you can invest and withdraw anytime. Though, it’s  suggested to stick to investing till your goal, for which you are  investing, matures. Investment starts with as low as 500 – 1000 rupees a  month
* Mutual Funds are better tax efficient medium of investing as compared to FD, as on FD normal income Tax slabs apply
* Mutual  Funds may experience some kind of volatility in short time, but in the  longer run, this creates the real wealth for investors. So, if you want  to create wealth in long run, Mutual Funds are the best medium to create  wealth.
* Look at this example, assuming 7% return in FD and 14%  return in Mutual Funds, to create a wealth of 1 crore rupees in 25 years  you would need to invest approx. 12 K per month in FD and only approx. 4  K per month in Mutual Funds

With platform like [go4wealth](http://go4wealth.com/), it is extremely convenient to invest and track your investment and goal progress.

How Mutual Funds are able to give better return?

Historically, the best way to create wealth has been to invest in  profitable companies. Mutual Funds invest in these profitable companies  to generate superior returns. Dedicated Fund Managers for schemes  oversee fund deployment based on analysis. They use Diversification,  which ensures that funds are not concentrated in few companies, rather  well spread. And since Indian economy is growing at a good pace, these  companies in turn become bigger by the day and so is the money invested  in them. So Mutual Funds schemes who invest money in these companies,  fetches higher returns.

In this time of fast paced engagements, where weekend spend of 500 –  2000 rupees on fast food and friends have kind of become necessity, it  is high time to switch to more productive way of creating long term  wealth by investing in Mutual Funds.

How to invest in Mutual Funds:

Investing in Mutual Fund is very easy with [go4wealth](http://go4wealth.com/).  You can create your investment profile in less than 5 minutes and  choose from our top recommended funds with ease and start your  investment journey."
31,2019-06-14,madelainem72,1,TradeFinex BOSS-101 And World Bank Bond-i: Which One Would You Prefer?,"**The Rundown**

1. Overview
2. The two digital bonds: BOSS-101 and Bond-i
3. BOSS-101
4. Bond-i
5. Conclusion

**Overview**

Needless to say, technology has changed the way the world of finance works. With the start of the digital revolution, the market for sustainable investing has evolved. Not only the financial instruments have become more digital, the database technology for financial products has also ripened. Sustainable finance has always stood at the forefront of big markets and only a technology that could be used

1. to provide large-scale financing to fund the projects,
2. make financial transactions behind the projects efficient, transparent, and secure,
3. streamline financial transactions in every corner of the globe, and
4. make financial transactions a matter of seconds

could be trusted for revolutionizing the finance industry. Blockchain is one such technology that allows financial institutions to have a single verifiable continuous record of information through a distributed asset register instead of registering transactions in a central system with a stored ledger. Since blockchain is a secure distributed ledger, only those with permission; can access the records. Participants can securely hold and trade the assets in a matter of seconds using blockchain powered platforms. In a nutshell, blockchain enables investors to trade the highest quality investments faster, more efficiently and with reduced risk.

The digitization of financial instruments, especially bonds will lead to an increase in investments. Digitization of bonds on the blockchain is thriving manifold, as there is now a bold move to fully automate the bond trading process. A few protocols are being set to handle scenarios for different kinds of bond trades, including buying a different bond with the sale of bonds, or of hedging the money from the sale of bonds. This will positively impact the liquidity on the market.

**The Two Digital Bonds: BOSS-101 and Bond-i**

Having said that, let’s discuss the two important blockchain-based digital bonds that are all over the media nowadays:

The two bonds that we will be discussing in this article are:

**1.** **BOSS-101**

TradeFinex, an open standards protocol for global trade and finance, that mitigates counterparty risks by making financial instruments liquid and interoperable has launched Bond Open Smart-Contracts Standard (BOSS)-101. The standard allows financial institutions to issue bonds on the XinFin Mainnet.

**2. Bond-i**

Bond-i is the world’s first digital bond, the first issue of the bond using blockchain technology. A blockchain operated new debt instrument, bond-i has been issued by the World Bank in Australian dollars on a platform developed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Bond-i enables both issuance and trading on Ethereum blockchain.

**BOSS-101**

Based on XinFin Hybrid Blockchain, TradeFinex BOSS-101 will simplify and streamline the entire corporate bond lifecycle. TradeFinex BOSS-101 will create a global bond standard by connecting traditional bond market with digital bond technology. Built-in KYC/AML regulations and standard features like profile creation for both organization and individual; makes TradeFinex BOSS-101, a real-life bond creation, and exchange platform.

A blockchain-powered digital bond, TradeFinex BOSS-101 is fully secure and transparent and will always avoid the risk of a single point of failure for its users. Not only will it make creating, managing, and liquidating bond instruments seamlessly easy but will also enable hassle-free automatic, instant, and efficient bond settlements for its users. Another major benefit would be the enhancement of secondary market liquidity by bringing brokers, dealers, and licensed entities on one single platform.

Let’s learn about BOSS-101 in detail:

**a) Eliminates counterparty risks and delays**

Who doesn’t remember the financial crisis of 2008? It was only after the crisis of 2008, Bitcoin came into being. The reason is: People lost confidence in trusted financial institutions. Counterparty risk is notably the most significant risk when it comes to financial transactions, the very proof being the industry’s reliance on credit ratings.

Through bond issuance on XinFin blockchain, the counterparty risk pertaining to financial intermediaries that transacting parties usually rely on in a traditional set up is fully eliminated. Immutability of XinFin blockchain eliminates the need for reconciliations allowing independent parties to work with universal data sources automatically. For market participants, automation allows for any kind of stored data record to be represented on the blockchain, from ownership of assets to contractual obligations, credit exposures or static data and even the deployment of self-enforcing smart contracts, Dapps, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Smart contracts over XinFin blockchain ensure agreements are implements to agreed-upon business outcomes.

**b) Increased transaction efficiency**

Secondary market transaction of private securities is very time-consuming and can take weeks or even months to conclude. The settlement times are usually three working days (T+3) for listed securities, provided the transaction is matched and securities are delivered without any delays. However, this is not always the case as manual intervention from various parties can take several days to settle a single trade. On smart contracts-powered XinFin mainnet, the transactions are executed on a peer-to-peer basis without a centralized clearinghouse and trades are always matched; leading to instant bond settlements. Moreover, process automation enables liquidity enhancement and price discovery around the clock.

**c) Supports broker-dealer and licensed entities**

An entity that facilitates the issuance of digital asset securities and secondary trading in digital asset securities acts as a “broker” or “dealer” that is required to register with the Commission and become a member of the self-regulatory organization, for example, FINRA. TradeFinex BOSS-101 digital bond deals with all kinds of registered broker-dealer and licensed entities which makes it lawful for any broker or dealer to induce or attempt the purchase or sale, of a bond (or any security).

**d) Enhances secondary market liquidity**

The secondary bond market that directly influences the pricing benchmarks in the primary bond market has witnessed a significant decline in trading volumes in the last few years. Factors compelling this decline include increasingly stringent industry regulations and the manual intervention used in trading fixed-income securities-including origination and communication processes that have not changed significantly in the last 50 years.

Powered by blockchain technology, BOSS-101 transforms the entire primary bond market by bringing all stakeholders, namely, brokers, dealers, and licensed entities together on one single platform. The facilitation of digital bond issuance on a secure, efficient, and transparent XinFin mainnet network results in the efficient discovery of benchmark prices, ultimately leading to the enhancement of secondary market liquidity.

**e) Issued in any currency**

TradeFinex BOSS-101 is a digital bond that can be issued in any currency. Therefore, international financial institutions can buy, sell or trade digital bonds making BOSS-101 a global-level bond platform.

**Live (bond creation) PoC on TradeFinex Website**

Running on XinFin mainnet, TradeFinex BOSS-101 digital bond is live where users can create their own bond by putting in details like bond details, identifiers, credit debit rating, coupon details, bond token, etc. Users can see the full functionality of how a bond is created, how it goes onto the ledger and how a transaction hash is generated on the TradeFinex website. Explore more about digital Bonds [here](http://localhost/DemoTradeFinex/publicv/boss_101).

**Bond-i**

The World-Bank in partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has recently enabled secondary market bond trading on the blockchain with the bond-i solution following its creation last year. The digital bond, dubbed as a “Bondi” bond — stands for Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument as well as holds a reference to Australia’s most famous beach, Bondi Beach.

The launch of bond-i formed part of World Bank’s broader strategic focus to harness the potential of disruptive technologies (i.e. blockchain) across all of its operations to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

Bond-i is perceived as an initial step in eliminating or minimizing manual intervention in bond sales and automating the entire process to make it fast and efficient.

Bond-i is a two-year bond that was arranged by CBA and raised somewhere around 110 million Australian dollars and the proceeds went towards sustainable development initiatives such as reducing poverty and promoting lasting development.

While the World Bank asserts bond-i to be the first “created, allocated, transferred, and managed through its life cycle using distributed ledger technology”, some companies have already issued bonds in different parts of the world.

As per the bond-i team, what sets them apart is that the entire bond process — from creation to allocation and management throughout its two-year cycle — takes place on the blockchain. Also, their scale is much larger than the private blockchain bond offerings.

The bond-i platform utilizes blockchain technology for issuance including launch, bookbuild, allocation and the management of bond holdings throughout the bond lifecycle. It features:

* Automated bond auction, bookbuild, and allocation
* Electronic bid capture
* Real-time updates and enhanced visibility according to participant’s permissions
* Auditable and immutable transaction record for probity and operational risk management
* A permissioned network of authorized participants

The completion of secondary transactions with trading activity recorded on a distributed ledger shows blockchain’s vast potential to enhance the coordination of securities trading and its management.

The nodes are deployed in Sydney and in Washington, and between these two nodes, smart contracts can be deployed in a way that actions can be automated between these two institutions without any manual intervention. Bond-i is an end-to-end program which can take financial institutions from the issuance of a bond right through to secondary market trading of that bond through a trusted shared ledger.

Bond-i secondary trading on the blockchain might be a giant step forward towards enabling capital markets to leverage distributed ledger technologies for faster, more efficient, and more secure transactions, the 51% attack possibility on ethereum blockchain can’t be overlooked. Moreover, bond-i is a digital bond that can be issued only in Australian dollars and not in all currencies. This means bond-i doesn’t have access to international financial institutions limiting it to specific regions and users who can buy, sell, and trade bonds.

**Conclusion:**

As mentioned earlier, bond-i will deploy a private ethereum blockchain for the creation and management of bonds. While ethereum blockchain might have been asserted as solid in terms of architecture, security, and functionality by Microsoft, financial institutions can’t ignore ethereum’s biggest failure — 51% DAO hack. Running on the proof-of-work mechanism, ethereum blockchain is exposed to 51% attack vector. This happens when a specific group acquires more computing power than the rest of the network combined. It can both reverse past transactions and prevent new ones from being signed on the blockchain. Undoubtedly, some biggest fundamental changes need to be made to ethereum blockchain — like changing proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake protocol to make it more secure. All these things explain why institutional investors and financial institutions are still reluctant to fully trust the reliability of the ethereum blockchain.

On the other hand, BOSS-101 is powered by open source enterprise-ready XinFin hybrid blockchain for global trade and finance. Combining the power and transparency of public network and security and speed of the private network and interoperable smart contracts, TradeFinex BOSS-101 digital bond can be listed in multiple secondary markets for great access to liquidity. For the bond instrument, XinFin uses the ISO20022 standard security message as a reference data and hash it on the bond details — something that makes it a secure and reliable option to bank upon for financial institutions.

32,2019-06-10,birkswithsocks,18,Big Banks Are Very Exposed To Leveraged Lending And CLO Markets,"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/04/15/big-banks-are-very-exposed-to-leveraged-lending-and-clo-markets/

&gt; By no means are banks immune to any downturn in leveraged lending. As pointed out in a very detailed research piece last week by Standard and Poor’s LCD News, “Banks and hedge funds, which over the past few years have taken a back seat to collateralized loan obligations and other institutional investors in the $1.19 trillion U.S. leveraged loan market, have regained market share in recent months amid a rockier, more risk-off environment.”

&gt; Banks are very exposed to leveraged loans in several ways. For example, banks:

* have leveraged loans on their books which they have underwritten,

* provide loans and a wide range of credit lines to non-banks who use those funds to underwrite leveraged loans to a wide range of companies and financial institutions,

* buy 50% of the collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), many of which contain leveraged loans,

* provide loans and a wide range of credit lines to insurance companies, pension funds, university endowments and other investors that buy collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and

* are counterparties to credit default swaps which banks and non-banks use to protect against leveraged loan or CLO defaults.

&gt; According to recent Bank for International Settlements data, leverage lending is now about $1.4 trillion, with about 71% of that lending underwritten in the U.S.  In the U.S., leveraged lending is now higher than the amount outstanding of high yield bonds.

&gt; Additionally, the vast majority of leveraged loans are covenant-lite which means that if any of those borrowers default, both bank and non-bank lenders will have very little protection against loss severities.

&gt; Many banks and non-banks sell a good part of the leveraged loans on their balance sheets to a variety of funds and especially, to special purpose vehicles which package the loans and sell them as fixed income products called collateralized loan obligations (CLOs.)

&gt; New CLO issuance and total CLO volumes outstanding have continued to grow since I last wrote about this in November 2018.  Since 2000, CLOs outstanding in the U.S. have grown from $72 to $616 billion, an almost 760% rise.  That rise is significantly higher than that of total collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) outstanding in the US, which have risen 364% in the same time period, because there has been a significant decrease in other types of CDOs, such as structured finance CDOs."
33,2019-06-05,Manny1400,0,Payroll data weak after a bad May,"Private payrolls increased by 27k in May, after increasing 271k in April. Obviously a big change. The US manufacturing PMI came in at 50.5 , the weakest figure since 2009 (but still above 50). Other areas of the economy slowing, and worries in the bond markets have inverted the yield curve.

&amp;#x200B;

Question is, why? And what does this mean going forward?

&amp;#x200B;

Several factors at play here: the government shutdown impacted the broader economy (that has been resolved), numerous interest rate hikes by the Fed since 2008, including four last year,  uncertainty over the infrastructure bill, unwarranted panic over tariffs, geopolitical concerns, and a predictable slowing of the economy

&amp;#x200B;

Last I checked, the Atlanta Fed was saying GDP for the second quarter would come in at 1.3% from 3.2% --a big drop. Not sure I buy that.

&amp;#x200B;

Going forward, a rate cut by the Fed is pretty much inevitable at this point (thus the market rally), Trump and the Dems seem to be reaching an agreement on the 2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill (which will stimulate the construction and manufacturing sectors),  the current P/E of the S&amp;P is 18.94, the lowest point since about October 2014 (stocks aren't cheap, but they aren't particularly expensive either--this is where we were in 1996). The trade issues with Mexico should be resolved pretty quickly, despite Trump's rhetoric. 

&amp;#x200B;

be bullish when others are afraid. With low inflation, lowest unemployment in decades, decent corporate earnings, lots of government spending on the horizon, a dovish Fed, a pro-business administration, and reasonably priced stocks, I am watching and waiting for opportunities."
34,2019-06-05,stockpikr,18,US stock futures trim gains after big ADP jobs report miss,"U.S. stock index futures gave back some of their gains on Wednesday after the release of much weaker-than-expected jobs data.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 63 points higher, indicating a gain of 72 points at the open. Dow futures pointed to a gain of more than 170 points earlier. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also trimmed gains.

Private payrolls increased by just 27,000 in May, according to data from ADP and Moody’s Analytics. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 173,00 jobs. May’s print was the worst since March 2010.

Treasury yields fell on the news. The benchmark 10-year yield traded at 2.09% while the 2-year rate hit its lowest level since December 2017.

The weak data added to the concerns that the economy was slowing while the U.S. takes a tough stance on trade with key partners like China and Mexico.

This is a surprise and not in a good way."
35,2019-07-28,closingbell,2,"WSJ: With Stocks at Fresh Highs, Investors’ Portfolios Look Alike. Mastercard, Microsoft, Amazon and PayPal are among market’s most crowded trades","A rally in stocks has triggered unusual circumstances for some of Wall Street’s biggest investors—they are holding many of the same companies.

A list of the market’s most crowded trades includes Mastercard Inc., MA 0.97% Microsoft Corp. MSFT 0.82% , Amazon.com Inc., AMZN -1.56% Abbott Laboratories ABT -0.28% and PayPal Holdings Inc., PYPL 0.32% according to analysts at Bernstein, who tracked institutional ownership, price momentum, earnings forecasts and valuations.

The overlap in the top 50 stocks holdings between mutual funds and hedge funds—two types of investors whose styles typically differ—now stands at near-record levels, a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found.

Investors are drawn to stocks that have performed well and risen fast. Shares that notched the fastest gains last year are valued nearly 25% higher than normally relative to their next 12 months of earnings, Bank of America’s study showed. Big movers include Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., CMG 0.30% Starbucks Corp. and VeriSign Inc. VRSN 0.34%

Some consequences of the trend were on display last week, after earnings surprises from Amazon, Ford Motor Co. F 0.10% , Tesla Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG 10.45% sparked outsize moves in their share prices. Tesla and Ford, two stocks that have trended higher in recent months, declined sharply when those companies reported disappointing results. Meanwhile, Google’s stock soared after the company reported that revenues rose 19% over the same period last year.

Big surges, like Google’s 9.6% gain on Friday, can make those companies even more appealing to trend-following investors, further concentrating them in a relatively small group of stocks, analysts said.

At the same time, few are willing to risk going against the crowd. Stocks that are comparatively cheap have attracted little interest, according to BofAML’s research. Short interest on what is known as FAANG stocks— Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., AAPL 0.35% Amazon, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet—is at historic lows, the bank said.

“This huge world of investible assets has shrunk down to a small cohort,” said Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We’re all in this echo chamber where everyone goes to the same dinners and drinks the same Kool-Aid.”

This week investors are awaiting a spate of key economic reports, including data on consumer spending, manufacturing and Friday’s nonfarm-payroll report, which investors will be gleaning for information on how the U.S. economy fared in July.

While most believe the Federal Reserve will deliver a 25 basis-point rate cut at its meeting on Wednesday, strong economic data could challenge projections for how much the central bank will ease monetary policy during the rest of the year, a potential obstacle for the market’s rally.

As earnings season rolls on, investors will also get a look at results from a range of companies, including Apple and Mastercard. These two companies are among those that have provided money managers safety in numbers.

Years of tepid expansion have also made investors hesitant to broaden their holdings outside of the companies delivering eye-catching results. That caution has been exacerbated in recent months, as slowing growth around the world sparked fears of a looming recession, widening the valuation gap between growth and value stocks to record levels, data from DWS Group showed.

Yet some investors worry that the concentration of money in a short list of stocks could exacerbate market declines if bad news sparks a rush to the exits. Some of the same large tech stocks led a May selloff that pulled the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory with a more than 10% decline from its highs, a steeper drop than the ones that hit the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500.

Contrarian and value-oriented strategies have waned in popularity in recent years as investors struggle to outperform market-tracking funds. Disagreement among analysts about a company’s earning prospects can also make shares comparatively unpopular.

Kent Engelke, managing director at Capitol Securities Management, has avoided those big tech stocks over the last three years, concentrating instead on finding stocks that are undervalued relative to the rest of the market. Lately, that has led him to invest in unglamorous areas like consumer nondurables and the oil sector.

“I’m miserable,” he said. “The last three years have been among the most difficult ever out of 33 in the industry because we haven’t owned FAANG.”

He plans on sticking to his guns, however, convinced that the rally can fall apart if the Fed eases monetary policy less than expected or if companies’ balance sheets worsen.

That could result in “a really big, ugly selloff,” he said.

So far, few investors seem inclined to change their approach, although many are now increasing their positions in assets that would take the edge off a potential hit to their portfolios. Prices for gold, a popular destination for nervous investors, are near their highest level in six years, while the Swiss franc stands at a two-year high against the euro.

Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said that markets may be overestimating how far the Fed will cut rates and that trade tensions between the U.S. and China could weigh on growth. They have balanced their position in U.S. stocks, which is overweight relative to their benchmark, with positions in havens like long-maturity Treasurys and the Japanese yen.

“We don’t think the alarms should be ignored,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients. “But we also think the long-term opportunity cost of aborting is likely to be too high.”

38,2019-07-17,Snlxdd,0,Foreign Impact on the Yield Curve and Signalling,"Seems lately there's been a lot of comments/posts talking about the importance of the inverted yield curve and how it's signalling an imminent market/economy collapse.  I thought it might be beneficial to contribute to the yield curve mania with my limited understanding of it and explanation for why it's inverted.

&amp;#x200B;

My main issue with all these posts is it appears to me (Disclaimer that I have very little experience investing) people are basing their decisions off of one single indicator.  If someone applied that same logic to stocks (e.g. ""I decided to buy this stock solely because they have a 10% dividend rate"") they would more than likely get ridiculed.  Especially if they chose an arbitrary point of data, which is what people are doing with the yield curve.  I think it's far more beneficial to examine and talk about the reason behind the yield curve making the movements it does

&amp;#x200B;

This may be an overly-simplified view of the yield curve but the way I see it there's a combination of 4 factors that would cause the yield curve to exhibit pressure to move one way or the other:

1. An increasing 3 month treasury yield that can be caused by 2 reasons:

a. Decreased demand for 3 month treasuries

b. Increased supply of 3 month treasuries

2. A decreasing 10 year treasury yield that can be caused by 2 reasons:

a. Increased demand for 10 year treasuries

b. Decreased supply of 10 year treasuries

&amp;#x200B;

I'm unable to find any numbers on how the supply of different denomination treasuries changes so I'm going to go ahead and assume that those are held relatively static by the fed for all intents and purposes.  This means at it's core, the issue that causes the yield curve to move in an inverted direction is that **people have a higher demand for long term debt.**  I think it makes sense that people favoring long term debt would be a factor in a recession since it shows that there's a lack of confidence in the economy.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't think is being consider is the increasing impact that the global economy has on the U.S. economy.  U.S. notes have been increasingly owned by foreign investors at a much higher rate than any other group ( [https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2018/03/09/on-the-supply-of-and-demand-for-u-s-treasury-debt](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2018/03/09/on-the-supply-of-and-demand-for-u-s-treasury-debt)).  Because of this I think it may make sense that:

A.  The largest factor in the current yield curve inversion is increased foreign demand for long-term securities that's more due to uneasiness in the global economy as opposed to uneasiness specifically targeted at the U.S. economy.

B.  It's not a perfect comparison to look at the yield curve now and compare it to what happened 10-50 years ago when such a big factor of it has had such a large change.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, investing is a very personal choice that's dependent on your own tolerance for risk and goals, so continue to do what you want with your money, I just thought this was an interesting perspective that I never see talked about in yield curve discussions.  Also happy to hear any critiques people have about my chain of thought.  I'm relatively new to investing and eager to learn why I'm wrong."

However as my last post was laughed at by crypto fanboys with their head in the sand and have no global market knowledge, let alone business; I stumbled across this and thought well if they won’t listen to words, maybe they’ll listen to their big banks and actual statistics, graphs and scientific data.

The comment section is a must read too, especially in terms of JP Morgan’s stance on the recession by 2020.

Anyway, very informative and hopefully some of the toxic community who hijacked my previously deleted thread might actually learn something.

Not a house flipping initiative, providing a service allowing sellers to get their house sold quicker for a fee and then marketing those houses back out to a massive audience. Win/Win for seller, allows them to get paid quicker and not have to worry about updates/selling process/typical real estate commissions.
 
Zillow website/app is the 18th most visited website in the United States, most of those coming from mobile (easily accessible).
18th sounds good? that beats Netflix #19, Pinterest #23, Linkedin #25.
 
-Zillow is able to constantly advertise their houses first and send emails to users/notifications, as well as the constant traffic they receive.
 
-Zillow has mass amounts of data that will help them improve their system as time goes on. This will make their estimates better and can help them market houses out more efficiently. Think Netflix and how they leverage data to pick the perfect show for you!
195 Million monthly visitors
 
Traditional Real Estate market is a massive opportunity and Zillow does not need the whole pie...only a piece of it.
 
Younger generations will browse apps for homes, Zillow being the largest allows them to be ahead of the game.

Accelerated revenue opportunity. Not to mention that they still make a good portion of revenue from their underlying advertisement business. Sellers can use Zillow offers to get a ballpark value for their house, even if they do not sell with Zillow...Zillow can update data and fine tune.
 
Obviously capital intensive and has its fair share of risk…but upside in my opinion is significant. Big data is important and they have mass amounts of data coming in. Look at the reports they are able to release on housing data…more detailed then what the government can even put together. The key point I like to push, is this does not need to kill of traditional real estate…I do not think it will…but it can definitely take a piece of the pie and more as time goes on.
I know there is other companies that do this, but none have the traffic/user data that Zillow will be able to leverage as time goes on.
 
It has had a nice run recently, so it may not be the ideal time to hop in..but that being said as of 6/14 it had 26million shares short, with only 2.8 million daily volume. There is definitely room for a large short squeeze if we see the positive momentum continue.
I was lucky enough to get in around 35, but I am holding strong.

Visa Inc. replaced Exxon as the 10th biggest member of the index by weighting on Aug. 1 and two weeks later Procter &amp; Gamble Co. also overtook the oil giant, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices will likely confirm the move when it publishes its month-end weightings Saturday.

“The oil sector has gone from being the leader of the world economy to a laggard,” said Tom Sanzillo, director of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, who traces Exxon’s presence in the S&amp;P top 10 back to the 1920s.

The growth of technology giants like Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. over the past decade coincided with the shale revolution that created an abundance of oil globally, weighing on energy companies. Exxon, once the gold standard in Big Oil, also has made some missteps: betting on Russia just before the country was slapped with sanctions and plowing money into U.S. natural gas in 2010 as prices collapsed.

With many investors betting on a post-hydrocarbon world, energy faces a battle to stay relevant to generalist investors. The sector makes up just 4.4% of the S&amp;P 500 Index compared with 11.7% a decade ago.

43,2019-08-22,prginocx,0,Potential short term market play coming up...,"I remember the election between GHW Bush and Bubbha Clinton, the media pretty much downplayed Bubbha's horndog reputation...but what they really downplayed a TON was the state of the economy. Most media was ALL IN for Bubbha to become the next President, and by the time election day rolled around they had a majority of American convinced the Economy was in big trouble and actually IN RECESSION.   Actual hard data didn't really show this at all, but if you repeat a narrative enough,  you'll lure in some % of the viewers.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today, the Media is pretty much all in for A.B.T., and they know the best chance to get rid of him is to convince Americans the Economy is sliding into or already IN RECESSION. Either way if you have some cash laying around, might be a good idea to plunk it into the market say around 3 months before the election. Say August of 2020. In that last 3 months you can bet every media outlet except Fox will be SCREAMING ABOUT IMPENDING ECONOMIC DOOM. So you plunk your cash IN, and if Trump loses, give the new person six months or so and you are almost sure to get a bounce because right after the new guy/girl wins, the media will switch gears and start braying about the economy bouncing back.   Your signal to get IN will be actual economic growth % versus defined recession numbers, if the growth is there, jump in...

&amp;#x200B;

Conversley, if Trump wins, the media will go back to their regular hate trump agenda, but the economy will bounce back since now the pressure to ""create"" a recession is off...

This is a real world example of why the Chinese state controlled media is pretty limited in how they report on the Chinese economy, their gov't is well aware that media can exaggerate the severity of an economic downturn or worsen a simple leveling off ( Of course the opposite is true, Media can inflate a bubble worse that it should be... ).

44,2019-08-21,ZaadNek,0,Invest in the next big thing after bitcoin (if any),"So, what are your bets?

Personally I think bitcoin will survive, because the big money likes it. Bitcoin has the name and proven to be secure for 10 years now. But I don't believe in all those other public blockchain projects. They shout a lot, but even in this early stage of adoption they already suffer from performing. And be honest, which other project do you use yourself? Blockchain is not user friendly at all. And all those tricks to make it perform, makes it less decentralised which is the whole point of bitcoin.

So if I have to pick a project that can be the next big thing. I would pick a project with no blockchain at all! But something different, still unique, technical superior and it must have a lot of potential to beat the current king.

From all the non-blockchain projects I know of, I think the SAFE Network(MAID) is the best candidate.  [https://medium.com/safenetwork](https://medium.com/safenetwork)  It's a complete decentralised anonymous data/communications network(unique!) which has its own consensus mechanism called PARSEC(technical superior!). This one is much faster than blockchain and scales very well by design. On top of this network you can build anything you can do on the current internet(lot of potential!). It is easy to use because you can use webbrowsers/apps on PC or phone to access the network, just you are used to right now. 

It will have its own cryptocurrency(private and realtime transactions) which is kinda backed by the data and services on the network. Which makes it valuable as well.

An unique project, but very big and ambitious. Still in development. So there is risk, but risk means high rewards.

What do you think? Any other candidates?"

47,2019-08-07,COMPUTER1313,15,Economist article about how shrinkflation and non-financial employment perks impact inflation and wage growth calculations,"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/08/06/how-shrinkflation-is-playing-havoc-with-economists-models

&gt; TWO YEARS ago British chocoholics felt the pinch from the decision to leave the European Union. As sterling tumbled, global firms selling to the British market faced the same production costs as before, but got less money for each sweet sold. Rather than raise the price per chocolate, some chose to shrink the chocolate per price. The famous peaks on a bar of Toblerone grew conspicuously less numerous (though Mondelez, the bar’s maker, said Brexit was not the cause). Other products suffered the same “shrinkflation”: toilet rolls and toothpaste tubes became smaller. The threat of Brexit made the phenomenon more visible, but it is surprisingly common. Statisticians and policymakers need to take note.

&gt; A forthcoming paper by Diego Aparicio and Roberto Rigobon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology helps make the point. Firms that sell thousands of different items do not offer them at thousands of different prices, but rather slot them into a dozen or two price points. Visit the website for H&amp;M, a fashion retailer, and you will find a staggering array of items for £9.99: hats, scarves, jewellery, belts, bags, herringbone braces, satin neckties, patterned shirts for dogs and much more. Another vast collection of items cost £6.99, and another, £12.99. When sellers change an item’s price, they tend not to nudge it a little, but rather to re-slot it into one of the pre-existing price categories. The authors dub this phenomenon “quantum pricing” (quantum mechanics grew from the observation that the properties of subatomic particles do not vary along a continuum, but rather fall into discrete states).

&gt; Just as surprising as the quantum way in which prices adjust is how rarely they move at all. Retailers, Messrs Aparicio and Rigobon suggest, seem to design products to fit their preferred price points. **Given a big enough shift in market conditions, such as an increase in labour costs, firms often redesign a product to fit the price rather than tweak the price. They may make a production process less labour-intensive—or shave a bit off a chocolate bar.**

&gt; Central banks are starting to see the consequences. Inflation does not respond to economic conditions as much as it used to. (To take one example, deflation during the Great Recession was surprisingly mild and short-lived, and after nearly three years of unemployment below 5%, American inflation still trundles along below the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%.) **In its recently published annual report the Bank for International Settlements, a club of central banks, mused that quantum pricing and related phenomena help account for such trends.**

&gt; But firms’ aversion to increasing prices may be as much a consequence of limp inflation as a contributor to it. When the price of everything rises a lot year after year, as in the 1970s and 1980s, firms can easily adjust the real, inflation-adjusted cost of their wares without putting off shoppers. A 5.5% jump in the cost of a pint after years of 5% increases does not send beer drinkers searching for other pubs in the way that a 0.5% hike after years of no change might. Thus falling inflation can make prices “stickier”. To compensate, firms instead find other ways to impose costs on buyers—such as making products smaller or lower-quality.

&gt; Labour markets are affected, too. Wages are notoriously sticky, especially downwards. In a world of low inflation, the ability to trim pay by raising wages less than inflation is lost to firms, with serious macroeconomic consequences. Economists blame sticky wages for causing unemployment during recessions. Facing reduced demand, firms that cannot cut pay to maintain margins while slashing prices instead reduce output—and sack workers.

&gt; But nimble firms have other options: the employment version of shaving a bit of chocolate from the bar. Some cut costs by boosting output per worker, often by driving workers harder. Tellingly, growth in output per worker now tends to fall in booms and rise during busts, precisely the opposite of the pattern 40 years ago, when inflation was high. Firms can respond to market pressures by reducing the benefits available to workers; Asda, a supermarket, recently announced plans to slash British workers’ holiday allowances. Or they can offer workers more tortuous schedules. Research published in 2017 suggests that being able to vary workers’ hours from week to week is worth at least 20% of their wages. On the flipside, during good times firms often opt to reward workers with office perks and one-off bonuses, rather than pay rises that cannot easily be clawed back during downturns.

&gt; If it happens on a sufficiently large scale, the practice of tweaking quality in lieu of price could play havoc with essential economic data. Statistical agencies do their best to account for changing product quality, but if adjustments are unexpectedly common or subtle then muted inflation figures could easily be concealing a more turbulent economic picture. Central banks watching for big swings in inflation or wage growth as a sign of trouble could be reacting to figures that bear far less relation to business conditions than they used to.

&gt; What’s more, the substitution of quality for price as firms’ main way of responding to changing market conditions weakens the case for keeping inflation low and stable. Inflation makes relative prices less informative, economists reckon, making it harder to decide what to buy and how to spend. Rather than clarity, low inflation has brought a different sort of confusion: one of shrinking chocolate bars and lost holidays. 

TL;DR: How does one measure inflation when a jar of peanut butter decreases in size from 10oz to 8z, or when the ice cream has more ""substitute"" ingredients that were cheaper than using milk/cream/sugar? How does one measure wage growth when an employer simply offers more generous vacation days and company picnics, only to claw them back when times get tough?"

“This is to me a natural reaction with the big price run up at the beginning of the year,” he said. “Through this whole correction we’ve seen more creation more shares coming into the fund, so generally speaking, investors seem to be looking at this as the market maturing, companies working through growing pains, execution pains, but they still have their eyes on the prize which is global expansion and the size that the global market will be in the next 10 to 15 years.”"
49,2019-08-02,ryeander,1150,Chinese Auditors Are on the Hook After Clients Are Caught Cooking the Books: “There has long been suspicion that Chinese companies have a tendency to fabricate results when necessary. And that seems to be a well-grounded concern”,"SHANGHAI—An accounting scandal has disrupted dozens of initial public offerings and other fundraising plans in China, intensifying investor concerns about the amount of trust they can place in audited financial results in the country.

In recent weeks, a string of Chinese companies have halted financing plans, with many saying the China Securities Regulatory Commission was investigating their auditor, Ruihua Certified Public Accountants, for suspected violation of securities law. The regulator and Ruihua officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.

The apparent investigation into Ruihua, China’s second-largest homegrown accounting firm by revenue, follows revelations of overstated earnings by a client.

In May, the securities commission began a probe of Ruihua’s smaller rival GP Certified Public Accountants Co., after finding that GP client Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. had inflated cash holdings by more than $4 billion.

With economic growth at its slowest since at least 1992, investors and analysts say many companies are experiencing financial distress, which in turn is revealing accounting problems that were easier to hide when credit was freely available and businesses were growing rapidly.

Beijing is probably also pressuring accountants to be more rigorous, they say, especially since foreign investors are now playing a larger role in China’s financial markets.

Economic and market weakness has prompted greater scrutiny of listed companies and auditors, as regulators seek to contain financial risk and “purify the market environment,” said Landing Zhang, chief executive of Shanghai asset-management firm CYAMLAN Investment.

The reliability of financial statements is one of several challenges facing investors in China. There are also question marks over the quality of local credit ratings and official economic data, while critical commentary by analysts and investors is often censored.

Chinese bookkeeping is also a sore point in Washington, since Beijing doesn’t allow U.S. authorities to inspect audits of Chinese companies listed in New York.

“There has long been suspicion that Chinese companies have a tendency to fabricate results when necessary. And that seems to be a well-grounded concern,” said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management.

Mr. Gillis said part of the reason is that it is extremely difficult to bet against companies by selling stocks short in China. “It’s short sellers who tend to identify most of the fraudulent companies because they have the incentives to do so.”

Auditors declined to endorse—or endorsed only partially—a record 219 annual reports last year, nearly double the 113 in the previous year, according to Wind Information Co., a data provider. These actions suggest an auditor has found issues with the results or has doubts about the company’s status as a going concern.

Earlier this year, the securities commission found a Ruihua client, Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co., had overstated profits for the four years through 2018 by $1.7 billion. After endorsing Kangde Xin’s financial statements for three years, Ruihua said it couldn’t express any opinion about the most recent annual report. Ruihua has said it completely fulfilled its auditing duties.

Since then, at least 23 listed companies that are Ruihua clients have flagged delays to refinancing plans, which can mean selling shares or convertible bonds, as have 28 IPO candidates. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has also postponed reviews of four Ruihua-linked applications to list on its new Science and Technology Innovation Board.

This is isn’t the first time Ruihua and peers have gotten into trouble. In 2017, the Ministry of Finance and the CSRC suspended Ruihua and rival BDO China from auditing public companies for roughly two months, according to the ministry’s website, after each was hit by two disciplinary actions within two years.

Ruihua was also fined by the market regulator in December 2018 because of problems with a client’s annual reports, and three years ago, served a one-year ban for some work related to the interbank bond market, after failing to assist a regulatory probe into a client that defaulted.

The local arms of international accountancy networks are the largest players in China, but vie with many local outfits, to whom they have lost market share in recent years, according to the Asian Corporate Governance Association.

Firms affiliated with the Big Four—PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG—and midtier player BDO are the five largest players.

Their combined revenue made up 26% of the total Chinese accounting market, according to a 2018 report by the Chinese Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In the U.S., arms of the Big Four and BDO audit about half of all listed companies, according to Audit Analytics.

Amy Lin, a Shanghai-based senior analyst at Capital Securities, said the cost of breaking the law was too low in China. The maximum fine for false financial disclosures is 600,000 yuan ($87,000), while the top criminal punishment for hiding or destroying accounting records is a prison term of five years and a fine of up to 200,000 yuan.

On July 26, the market regulator said it would increase prison terms and fines for capital-markets misdeeds, and would revoke licenses of intermediaries, including accounting firms, that failed to fulfill their duties.

“The authorities have a clear intention to use the outburst of financial fraud as an opportunity to clean up the market, partly because they have limited capacity to bail out all the troubled companies,” said Shen Meng, director at Chanson &amp; Co., a Beijing-based boutique investment bank.

51,2019-09-19,Tracy1Sweet,0,the market of gold.,"The value of gold is also floating. Any price is determined by the supply and demand relationship, unless the price is regulated. Before the 1970s, the price of gold was basically determined by governments or central banks. The international price of gold was relatively stable. In the early 1970s, the price of gold was no longer directly linked to the US dollar. The price of gold gradually became marketized, and the factors affecting the price change of gold were increasing. Specifically, it can be divided into the following aspects:

1. Supply factors:

The main supply factors are:

(1) The gold stock on the ground

There are currently approximately 137,400 tons of gold in the world, and the stock of gold on the ground is still growing at a rate of about 2% per year.

(2) Annual supply and demand

The annual supply and demand of gold is about 4,200 tons, and the annual output of gold accounts for 62% of the annual supply.

(3) New gold mining costs

The average total cost of gold mining is about $260/oz. Due to the development of mining technology, the cost of gold development has continued to decline over the past 20 years.

(4) Political, military and economic changes in the gold producing countries

Any political or military turmoil in these countries will undoubtedly directly affect the amount of gold produced in the country, which in turn will affect the world's gold supply.

(5) Central bank's gold selling

The central bank is the world's largest holder of gold. In 1969, the official gold reserve was 36,458 tons, accounting for 42.6% of the total surface gold stock at that time. By 1998, the official gold reserve was about 34,000 tons, accounting for the total amount of gold mined. 24.1%. Based on current production capacity, this is equivalent to 13 years of world gold mine production. Since the main use of gold is gradually transformed from important reserve assets into metal materials for the production of jewellery, or to improve the country’s balance of payments, or to curb international gold prices, the central bank’s gold reserves have been in absolute and relative quantities for 30 years. There has been a big decline, and the decline in the number is mainly due to the sale of stocks in the gold market. For example, the massive sell-off by the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank and the International Monetary Fund's readiness to reduce gold reserves have become the main reason for the recent decline in gold prices in the international gold market.

2. Demand factors:

The demand for gold is directly related to the use of gold.

(1) Changes in the actual demand for gold (jewelry, industry, etc.).

Generally speaking, the speed of development of the world economy determines the total demand for gold. For example, in the field of microelectronics, gold is increasingly used as a protective layer; in the fields of medicine and architectural decoration, despite advances in technology, gold substitutes continue to Appeared, but gold is still on the rise due to its special metal properties.

In some areas, local demand has a major impact on gold demand. As India and Southeast Asian countries, which have always had a large demand for gold jewelry, have been affected by the financial crisis, gold imports have been greatly reduced since 1997. According to the World Gold Council data, gold demand in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Korea fell by 71 respectively. %, 28%, 10% and 9%.

(2) The need to preserve value.

Gold reserves have always been used by the central bank as an important means of preventing domestic inflation and regulating the market. For ordinary investors, investing in gold is mainly for the purpose of maintaining value in the case of inflation. In the economic downturn, gold prices have risen due to rising demand for gold relative to monetary asset insurance. For example, in the three US dollar crisis after World War II, due to the serious trend of the US balance of payments deficit, the US dollar holdings increased significantly, the market’s confidence in the value of the US dollar was shaken, and investors rushed to buy gold, which directly led to the bankruptcy of the Bretton Woods system. . In 1987, due to the depreciation of the US dollar, the US deficit increased, and the unstable situation in the Middle East also contributed to the sharp rise in international gold prices.

(3) Speculative demand.

According to the international and domestic situation, speculators use the gold price volatility in the gold market, coupled with the trading system of the gold futures market, a large number of “short-cut” or “replenishment” gold, artificially creating the illusion of gold demand. In the gold market, almost every major decline is related to the hedge fund company borrowing short-term gold in the spot gold market and building a large number of short positions on the COMEX gold futures exchange. When the price of gold fell to a 20-year low in July 1999, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released data showing that the speculative shorts in COMEX are close to 9 million ounces (nearly 300 tons). When a large number of stop-loss selling orders are triggered, the gold price plunges, the fund company takes the opportunity to make up the profit, and when the gold price rebounds slightly, the hedging forward selling from the producer suppresses the gold price further, and gives the fund company The new opportunity to re-establish a short position, formed a downward pattern of gold prices below a wave.

3. Other factors:

(l) The impact of the US dollar exchange rate.

The US dollar exchange rate is also one of the important factors affecting the fluctuation of gold prices. Generally, if there is a dollar in the gold market, the price of gold will fall; if the dollar falls, the law of gold will rise. The strong US dollar generally represents a good domestic economic situation in the United States. Domestic stocks and bonds will be sought after by investors, and the function of gold as a means of value storage is weakened. The decline in the US dollar exchange rate is often related to inflation, stock market downturns, etc. The function is again reflected. This is because the depreciation of the US dollar is often related to inflation, while the high value of gold is often stimulating an increase in the value of gold and speculative demand as the dollar depreciates and inflation intensifies. In August 1971 and February 1973, the US government twice announced the depreciation of the US dollar. Under the influence of the sharp fall in the US dollar exchange rate and inflation, the price of gold rose to an all-time high in the beginning of 1980, exceeding $800 per ounce. Looking back at the past 20 years of history, the US dollar has strengthened against other Western currencies, and the price of gold in the international market has fallen. If the US dollar depreciates slightly, the price of gold will gradually rise.

(2) The monetary policy of each country is closely related to the international gold price.

When a country adopts a loose monetary policy, as the interest rate falls, the country's money supply increases, increasing the possibility of inflation, which will cause the price of gold to rise. For example, in the 1960s, the US low interest rate policy prompted domestic capital outflows. A large amount of US dollars flowed into Europe and Japan. As countries increased their net position in the US dollar, they worried about the value of the US dollar. They began to sell dollars in the international market and snapped up gold. Eventually led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system."

Beneath China’s stable headline numbers, there is a growing belief that the real picture is much worse

By Mike Bird and Lucy Craymer
Sept. 8, 2019 12:29 pm ET

In the second quarter of this year, official Chinese data showed economic growth of 6.2%, close to Beijing’s target and within a percentage point of what it has reported every quarter for the past 4½ years.

A few months earlier, satellites monitoring Chinese industrial hubs suggested parts of the world’s largest trading economy were contracting. An index of Chinese industrial production created by a multinational manufacturer was pointing to lower growth than official figures. And a web-search index used to gauge how many workers return to their jobs after the Lunar New Year holidays was down sharply from a year earlier.

Beneath China’s stable headline economic numbers, there is a growing belief among economists, companies and investors around the world that the real picture is worse than the official data. That has analysts and researchers crunching an array of alternative data—from energy consumption to photos taken from space—for a more accurate reading.

Their conclusion: China’s economy isn’t tanking, but it is almost certainly weaker than advertised. Some economists who have dissected China’s GDP numbers say more accurate figures could be up to 3 percentage points lower, based on their analysis of corporate profits, tax revenue, rail freight, property sales and other measures of activity that they believe are harder for the government to fudge.

China, whose GDP topped $13 trillion last year, is still growing, and the alternative data points to that. It indicates the deceleration is happening in areas such as manufacturing. In many cases, alternative indicators have previewed the path of official data and show the depth of the challenges Chinese authorities face.

“Manufacturing is being hit really hard,” said Leland Miller, chief executive officer of China Beige Book, which measures China’s economic strength based on thousands of survey responses from mainland companies. “Investment is down, hiring took a serious hit, a huge hit to new orders.”

China on Friday released billions of dollars to banks in an effort to revive business sentiment as the U.S.-China trade battle continues. The People’s Bank of China reduced the amount of money commercial banks have to hold in reserve, enabling lenders to finance projects.

Much of the data “is telling us nothing good about the China economy,” said Eric Pratt, head of global marketing at AVX Corp. , a maker of electronic components based in Fountain Inn, S.C., which has two Chinese factories producing parts for cars and mobile phones. Mr. Pratt said over the past year, as alternative indicators and forecasts pointed to more weakness, his company cut some jobs and slowed production.

Over the past decade, China’s growth has made up between a quarter and a third of the world’s economic expansion. The country’s size and interconnectedness around the globe now means small changes in output impact the performance of all major economies, including the U.S. and trade-oriented ones such as Germany and Japan.

Since the escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict, suspicion that China may be massaging its official data to paint a picture of broad economic health has become a challenge for Washington. U.S. trade negotiators have been seizing on any signs of weakness in their attempt to squeeze more concessions from Beijing.

As the effects of tit-for-tat tariffs filter into China’s economy, the country’s government has also tightened access to data that has proved reliable in the past, in some cases stopping the release of indicators that paint an unfavorable picture.

In December, a manufacturing index for the trade-intensive Guangdong province was suspended after trailing national figures for months. The country’s National Bureau of Statistics said the local government that produced the index didn’t have permission to do it.

China’s official unemployment figures haven't changed much since the trade war began, raising questions about their reliability.

One challenge for businesses and investors is that China’s economy can’t be easily deciphered using measures such as unemployment and real GDP growth because those numbers don’t change much or are carefully managed. Where China’s central bank sets interest rates also isn’t a good gauge of growth, because most large Chinese banks are state-owned entities whose lending is driven by policy goals rather than profit motives.

One official measure of China’s unemployment rate has hovered between 3.5% and 4.5% for the last 15 years, a pattern that has led many economists to conclude it is unreliable. About two years ago, China began publishing an unemployment rate for urban areas derived from a labor survey that authorities said was more accurate. It recently showed a higher reading of 5.3%, but has also moved in a fairly tight range.

Authorities have defended their data. Earlier this year, after China reported stronger-than-expected GDP growth, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said the state wasn’t ironing out economic fluctuations. In August, another representative of the body said its survey of the country’s labor force was relatively reliable, scientific and accurate.

Generally speaking China’s data has captured some degree of slowdown, though sometimes later than private measures. But government efforts to keep the economy from cratering, such as infrastructure spending, lending and other stimulus, can obscure areas of weakness or smooth headline growth numbers. As a result, they often don’t capture what companies are seeing on the ground, independent economists say.

That has left the door open for dozens of proprietary data providers who are competing for a growing field of financial and multinational clients, global central banks and government agencies around the world. They face a challenging task given China’s vast and diverse economy where labor conditions, incomes and business activity levels vary widely between modern cities, manufacturing hubs and swaths of rural areas.


Companies that sense the economy isn’t doing so well are adjusting their strategies. American apparel company Brooks Brothers Group Inc. is expanding in China, but after detecting weaker retail sentiment in conversations with mall operators and in customer traffic and tourist numbers, the chain is in some cases setting up shop in smaller spaces instead of larger stores.

“There has been some softening,” said Andy Lew, president of Brooks Brothers’ international division.

London-based research firm Capital Economics has its own gauge of Chinese economic growth constructed from measures such as the amount of property floor space under construction, electricity output, freight and passenger traffic, and seaport volumes. “The problem is not a lack of data but more the quality,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, its Singapore-based senior China economist.

The firm’s index, called the China Activity Proxy, has shown growth below official figures for the past seven years. It recently indicated an expansion rate of around 5.7% due in part to stronger construction activity. But electricity production—a proxy for heavy industry—has slumped and credit growth remains weak, supporting the idea that parts of the economy aren’t doing well.


In July, China reported 4.8% year-over-year growth in industrial output, its slowest pace in 17 years. A large multinational company had seen the signs much earlier.

Eaton Corp. , a global manufacturer of electrical components and power systems for buildings, industrial facilities, planes and other machinery, has about $2 billion sales in China. Last year, its in-house index showed 2.7% industrial production growth while China’s official reading was above 5% over the course of 2018. The company’s index estimated 2.5% growth for the first half of 2019.

The index was constructed by a team of in-house economists about a decade ago, when Eaton noticed demand in its markets was weaker than Beijing’s growth numbers, said its former chief economist Jim Meil. The index was built from Chinese data combed from domestic sources that included automotive sales, steel production and construction activity, Mr. Meil said.


SpaceKnow tracks about 6,000 industrial locations in China and analyzes data on night-light luminosity and infrared bands—indicators of heat produced by electricity or factories—from about half those sites roughly every two weeks. It produces a proprietary index that has become a leading Chinese PMI indicator used by hedge funds, central banks and policy makers, said CEO Jeremy Fand.

“You can see factories suddenly go quiet, giant subdivisions, huge construction projects just get halted,” said Mr. Fand. In August, SpaceKnow’s index pointed to a slight expansion, coming close to official figures that analysts said reflected a pickup in production before more U.S. tariffs came into effect.

Mr. Fand said the company is also working on a project for a U.S. government agency that is trying to analyze the impact of U.S. tariffs on China’s economy and certain industries.

Last December, U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq Inc. bought an alternative-data business called Quandl Inc. Bill Dague, a data scientist leading alternative research at Quandl, has traveled to China in recent months to hunt for new data sets for clients.

“Because it is so hard to get data out of China, demand has surpassed supply,” he said, adding that escalating U.S.-China tensions have made domestic data vendors less willing to share information with U.S. companies.

Quandl’s data includes satellite images of aluminum stockpiles and containers of concentrate sitting outside Chinese smelters and storage facilities before and after the U.S. imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese aluminum in March 2018.


Before the duties took effect, geospatial images indicated factories were ramping up aluminum production. By the summer of that year, the stockpiles had run down and the production supplies weren’t replenished at many smelters, indicating slower production and slackening demand weeks before it was reflected in Chinese government data.

George Mussalli, who oversees research and investments at Boston-based PanAgora Asset Management Inc., said one metric he monitors yearly is a “Spring Festival Index” produced by Chinese web-search giant Baidu Inc. PanAgora is a quantitative investment fund that uses data, mathematical and computer models to develop trading strategies.

Baidu’s index is compiled from the number of people who use its search engine to find information about travel and transportation options around the weeklong festival, which coincides with Lunar New Year. During that period, millions of workers embark on long commutes from big industrial cities to rural areas in central China to spend the holiday with their families.


One index showed a drop in the number of people searching about travel for a weeklong spring festival this year.

This year’s festival took place in early February, and the index showed a 12% drop in the number of people searching about travel in contrast to the previous year. Mr. Mussalli said the lower reading was a sign of slower economic activity.

“In years where factories expect less production, some of the workers go home and stay home,” Mr. Mussalli said.

China’s automotive sector, which makes up about a 10th of GDP, has been in a slump since late 2018. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the organization that puts out official sales numbers and forecasts, had earlier estimated that 2019 sales would be flat year on year. In the first seven months of the year, they fell 12.8%. Despite that, the official forecast is now for a 5.4% full-year decline.

Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch are less optimistic. They forecast a 3.6% drop in car sales at the start of 2019 and now expect a 12% drop for the year.

Ming Hsun Lee, a Hong Kong-based autos analyst at the bank, has been using data from a domestic vendor that collects weekly numbers from companies on production levels, sales to dealers and retail car sales. He said he uses it to calculate inventory levels at manufacturers, and considers price discounts, government stimulus and other factors in developing his forecast.

Mr. Pratt at AVX, the U.S. electronics component maker, said the company has been using the bank’s data to help gauge demand and adjust production. “We don’t use what the government says because they are always really protective of their automotive industry,” he said."
53,2019-09-05,rao-blackwell-ized,757,"Why I'm not a ""dividend investor""","I posted this in /r/M1Finance where many users appeared to be novice investors who subscribe to a dividend yield chasing strategy in taxable accounts, toward whom my post was geared. I'm sure most users here in /r/investing already know all the things I've listed below, but I thought users here might enjoy some of the research. I've taken out the M1-sub-related introduction and comments.

First, let’s define what we’re referring to here. There’s a strategy in which *dividend growth* \- a company increasing their dividend payment over time - is used as an *indicator* to *identify* strong, stable, successful companies to invest in. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, and could even potentially allow you to beat the market (though historically dividend yield *per se* has actually been shown to be a suboptimal indicator of value, and is not an empirical factor that influences stock performance), as buying high-dividend-yield and dividend growth stocks incidentally gets you exposure to empirical equity factors like Value, Quality and lower volatility in likely-mature, conservative companies. This is actually a big part of how Warren Buffett picks stocks.

There are funds that aggregate these exact types of stocks, and they sometimes ironically have a lower dividend yield than a broad index fund. Vanguard’s VIG is the most popular one. However, recent research has shown this is still probably not the optimal approach. We’ll dive into these funds and that research more specifically later.

What I’m referring to, and what I see more often, is what are sometimes called *dividend chasers* \- those seeking out individual high-dividend-yield stocks or funds for the sake of the dividend itself, which is usually what’s being referred to any time you see any of these words or phrases in relation to an investing strategy:

* “Income”
* “Passive income”
* “Income investing”
* “Dividend investing”
* “Living off the dividends”
* “$X per month”

**For the sake of clarity, in this post I'm referring to chasing dividend yield as ""dividend investing"" or ""dividend chasing,"" and I'm referring to investing in companies that have a history of** ***increasing*** **their dividend over time as ""dividend** ***growth*** **investing."" It's a subtle but important distinction, and the different terms are sometimes thrown around interchangeably, adding to the confusion.**

&amp;#x200B;

I get it. Dividend chasing as a strategy is easy to sell, and proponents are good at selling it, either sweeping the data and math under the rug, ignoring it altogether, or simply not knowing it in the first place. I can see the attraction at first glance - predictable cash payments into your account while keeping the same number of shares. Sounds great!

In fairness, I suspect most novice investors also simply don’t know some of the underlying mechanics that can make dividends *per se* drag down your net total return, which is what you should always be focused on. What saddens me is these same novice investors will likely see pro-dividend-chasing blogs and videos and jump in without hesitation, screening for high dividend yield stocks and throwing them in their portfolios.

Here are the reasons why I don’t chase dividends:

&amp;#x200B;

**1.** **Dividends result in a larger tax burden.**

Arguably the most important point here, but one that I think is often misunderstood and simply repeated platitudinously. If you’re holding dividend-paying assets in a taxable account, you are invariably paying more in taxes than if you were holding non-dividend-paying assets. If you are chasing dividends, you are consciously paying more in taxes than you have to.

Whether you call it a “dividend” or “withdrawal” or “income” doesn’t matter; it is a taxable event. Period. Even if your dividends are reinvested (in which case, what’s the point of chasing them?), they’re still taxed upon distribution. Thus they create a net loss in taxable accounts compared to the same securities if they didn’t pay a dividend.

Imagine selling shares of stock and immediately buying them back at the same price. You have accomplished nothing, but you’ve been taxed as a result. This is precisely how dividends work in a taxable account.

One of the pro-dividend points often raised in regard to taxation is that *qualified* dividends are taxed at a lower rate, which is true. Unfortunately, dividend chasers, in going after high yields, end up holding things like REITs in their taxable accounts, which distribute *non-qualified* dividends that are taxed at marginal income tax rates.

Moreover, even qualified dividends are taxed at capital gains rates, which is what you would pay anyway when you sell shares. Selling shares at the LTCG rate to realize only the withdrawal amount you actually *need*, *when* you need it, allows you to postpone that taxation. Also, if the amount of your withdrawal is lower than the forced periodic withdrawal of your dividends, you’ll pay less in taxes.

This is why I always try to stress that dividend-paying securities, especially high dividend payers like REITs, **should not be held in a taxable account** if you can avoid it. Specifically, put high dividend yield assets in a tax-advantaged retirement account where they can do no harm, turn on automatic reinvestment, and use growth stocks (growth stocks pay no or low dividends) and municipal bonds (tax-free) in your taxable account.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Dividends are not “free money.”**

A company’s or fund’s dividend has already been intrinsically factored into its value and subsequently, its share price. That is, it has already been “priced in.” Markets are efficient. You are not gaining anything extra by receiving a dividend. $1 is $1 is $1; there is no free lunch in the market.

For a simplistic, hypothetical example, let’s say you own Company ABC and you transfer $1 from its company bank account to your personal bank account. Your net worth has not increased as a result; you own the company, so you owned that $1 the whole time. You’ve just subtracted it from somewhere - in this case the company’s value - and added it somewhere else - your pocket.

Similarly, your partial ownership of a different company (in the form of shares) may be worth $1 that the company holds. Upon transferring it to you in the form of a dividend, you are no wealthier as a result, as the company’s value has just decreased by the amount of its dividend payment. Specifically, with the dividend, you own more shares at a lower price. Without the dividend, you own fewer shares at a higher price. They are identical. [Here’s a graphical summary of this concept.](https://i1.wp.com/earlyretirementnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SWR-Part29-Chart01a-1.png?resize=863%2C575&amp;ssl=1)

Essentially, you are being paid with your own money. This concept is similar to how some people get excited about receiving a tax refund each year. It was your money all along.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Dividends limit total returns.**

Because of the nature of #2 above, you are effectively withdrawing money from your account each time a dividend is distributed. If they are not reinvested, you have now taken out capital that could have been left in to appreciate more, ultimately actually *lowering* your total returns. That is, those dividends are missing out on the compounding. This is another hugely important distinction in considering whether or not to reinvest dividends.

For a simplistic, theoretical, ad hoc example, if you bought 1 share of Company A at $100 and it increases by 10% to $110, your unrealized return is 10%. Company A does not pay a dividend. Let’s suppose you also have 1 share of Company B, which also has a share price of $100, and that Company B just paid you a $1 dividend that you chose not to reinvest but take as income. Company B also grew by 10%. Company B’s share price is now $99, which has now grown by 10% to $108.90. Adding in your $1 dividend distribution you took equals $109.90, for a total return of 9.9%. Your initial investment capital is the same in both examples, yet your total return on Company B is lower than Company A.

Disregarding taxation, we could even simplify that example and exclude the 10% growth aspect to show that $100 in Company A = $99 in Company B + $1 dividend, meaning the dividend puts you right back where you started. At scale, in the market as a whole, this is all usually happening somewhat invisibly behind the scenes, but [rest assured it is happening](https://www2.bc.edu/thomas-chemmanur/phdfincorp/MF891%20papers/MM%20dividend.pdf). Again, $1 is $1 is $1.

Had you put $10,000 in an S&amp;P 500 index fund in 1985 and let it sit for 34 years through 2018 without adding anything and [reinvested the dividends](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;symbol1=VFINX&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;total1=100&amp;total2=0&amp;total3=0), you would have ended up with $314,933 for a total return of 3049%, an effective CAGR of 10.68%. [Without reinvesting dividends](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=true&amp;reinvestDividends=false&amp;symbol1=VFINX&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;total1=100&amp;total2=0&amp;total3=0), you would have ended up with capital appreciation of $118,556 and dividend payments of $37,394 for a total of $155,950 and a total return of 1460%, an effective CAGR of 8.41%. That’s less than half the return!

As another simplistic, somewhat extreme but very telling example, “A Single Share of Coca-Cola Bought for $40 in the 1919 IPO With Dividends Reinvested Is Now Worth $9,800,000 vs $341,545 Without Dividends Reinvested.” [Source here](https://www.joshuakennon.com/reinvesting-dividends-versus-not-reinvesting-dividends-coca-cola/).

**These examples still do not even factor in the tax on the dividends you took as income.** Pre-tax returns of dividend-paying and non-dividend-paying stocks are identical (which is why dividends are harmless in a retirement account if reinvested), but taxation invariably, unequivocally results in a lower total return for the dividend investor in a taxable account.

Compound these issues across many stocks with much more money over many years and you can see the huge problem this creates. We’ll illustrate this specific problem with some more realistic examples later.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Dividends are a forced withdrawal.**

Extending #3 above, dividends are simply a withdrawal forced upon you by the very company you’re invested in. If you’re truly investing with a long time horizon, chances are you don’t need the dividend distribution as income monthly, quarterly, or even annually. Even if you did, you could simply withdraw what and when you wanted as discussed above.

Instead, dividend distributions force you to withdraw money at regular intervals regardless of whether or not you want to. This can be particularly problematic if you are purposely trying to keep your taxable income low in a specific year.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. I don’t want dividends.**

With a company’s earnings, they can choose to pay for things like R&amp;D, future projects for growth, and mergers and acquisitions. If they are in a position in which they can do none of those things, they can return value to shareholders via dividends or stock buybacks. On average, all these things achieve the same net result for shareholders.

If I’m invested in Company A, the dividend is the *last* outcome I want out of the aforementioned options. After all, I’m invested in Company A because I think it will grow! Warren Buffett, arguably the most respected investor in history, [feels the same way](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021615/why-doesnt-berkshire-hathaway-pay-dividend.asp), which is why Berkshire Hathaway doesn’t pay a dividend.

I would also argue that share repurchases are slightly better than dividends anyway, given that you’re essentially taxed *twice* on dividends since the company \[hopefully\] had to pay corporate income taxes on that cash.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Dividends only possess a psychological benefit.**

This is the reason why I think dividend chasing *intuitively* seems attractive at first glance and why many people illusively buy into it as a strategy. It simply feels good to have cash show up in your account regularly and predictably. This part I understand somewhat.

Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman actually [looked into the phenomenon](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304405X84900254) of dividend preference in 1984. They found 2 main reasons why some investors chase dividend yield:  1) those investors recognize they are unable to delay gratification and adopt a “cash flow” approach to pay for regular expenses, and 2) the psychological principle of loss aversion causes investors to prefer the feeling of receiving a dividend over “losing” shares in order to realize capital gains of an equal amount.

I try to stay pragmatic and scientific with my investing and leave emotions out as much as I can. If for some reason the mental accounting fallacy of dividend chasing keeps an investor more disciplined or lets them sleep better at night than selling shares in a buy-and-hold strategy would, then I’d have to support it. I would rather see someone chase dividend stocks than penny stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Dividend chasing decreases diversification.**

By solely chasing dividend stocks, you’re missing out on roughly 60% of the US market, thereby posing a concentration risk and resulting in a lack of diversification, especially considering that 60% contains nearly all the small-cap stocks in the market, as small-caps usually don’t pay dividends. This also means you’re missing out on the potential outperformance of that 60%, which is of some significance considering [small-cap value stocks have outperformed their large-cap counterparts over time](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&amp;mode=1&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1972&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2019&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;sameFees=true&amp;asset1=SmallCapValue&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;asset2=LargeCapValue&amp;allocation2_2=100&amp;total1=100&amp;total2=100&amp;total3=0).

Second, there is no sound evidence that dividend-paying stocks are any better - in terms of total return - than non-dividend-paying stocks. Remember, the dividend itself does not account for a stock’s performance.

Lastly, we know that picking individual stocks is extremely unlikely to outperform a broad market index over a time horizon of 30+ years anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Dividends are not guaranteed.**

Dividend investors usually like to claim that their predictable dividend payments will still be there during market turmoil. This is not necessarily true. [Companies can decrease or eliminate their dividend payment at will](https://www.dividend.com/dividend-education/the-biggest-dividend-stock-disasters-of-all-time/).

Even worse, companies will sometimes borrow in order to pay their dividends so as to not spook shareholders by decreasing or eliminating the dividend, in which case you effectively just borrowed with interest to pay yourself your own money.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, [Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani figured all this out in 1961](https://www2.bc.edu/thomas-chemmanur/phdfincorp/MF891%20papers/MM%20dividend.pdf), so it’s frustrating to see the [myths of dividend chasing](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2876373) and “income investing” persist. Again, I suppose since it’s an active strategy, it’s easier for people to create blogs and YouTube videos and newsletters around it and make money providing information to people who are new to investing or who may not know any better. It’s also a lot more exciting than saying “Buy VTI and don’t touch it for 30 years.”

&amp;#x200B;

So now let’s circle back to our first “type” - “dividend growth” investing - and look at some specific funds. Again, note that I am in no way against this strategy of investing in stocks with a history of increasing their dividend over time (""*dividend growth*""). It may allow you to beat the market in the long run.

[VIG](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VIG) is probably the most popular of this type, and rightfully so. It “*seeks to track the performance of the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index (formerly known as the Dividend Achievers Select Index).*” So it focuses on large-cap blend stocks with a history of dividend growth (*increasing* their dividend payment over time). There’s also an international version, [VIGI](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VIGI).

Dividend chasers seem to like [VYM](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VYM) due to its yield. It “*seeks to track the performance of the FTSE® High Dividend Yield Index, which measures the investment return of common stocks of companies characterized by high dividend yields.*” So here we’re looking at large-cap value stocks that happen to have a high dividend yield, *not* necessarily an increasing dividend over time. I think because of that fact, because Growth has outperformed Value in recent years, and because tech has performed well in recent years, VIG has crushed VYM recently. Granted, because VIG is looking at dividend *growth* and VYM is looking at the dividend yield *per se*, these funds aren’t really the same thing.

Even with dividends reinvested, [VIG would have given you an extra CAGR of 1.33% compared to VYM since VYM’s inception in late 2006](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2019&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=true&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=VIG&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=VYM&amp;allocation2_2=100&amp;total1=100&amp;total2=100&amp;total3=0). VYM also lagged the S&amp;P, while VIG beat it and had a higher Sharpe ratio, better max drawdown and Worst Year figures, and less volatility. Interestingly too, VIG fared much better than both VYM and the S&amp;P through the 2008 crisis and the recent Q4 2018 correction.

Despite offering these funds, [Vanguard itself investigated the strategies](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGADOS.pdf) contained in VYM and VIG and concluded, as I pointed out earlier, that the stocks’ performance was fully explained by exposure to equity factors like Value, Quality, and lower volatility. Specifically, the returns of high-dividend-yield equities are explained by the factors of Value and low volatility, and the returns of dividend growth equities are explained by Quality and low volatility. This is not a bad thing, just something to note - that the dividend payment itself is not responsible for the \[out\]performance of VIG compared to the S&amp;P 500. Again, VIG may allow you to beat the market in the long run.

[SCHD](https://www.schwabfunds.com/public/csim/home/products/exchange_traded_funds/summary.html?symbol=SCHD) is another popular fund like VYM. [Both have lagged the S&amp;P](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2019&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=VYM&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=SCHD&amp;allocation2_2=100&amp;total1=100&amp;total2=100&amp;total3=0) since SCHD’s inception in 2011. This makes some sense when we look at the valuation metrics of these types of funds. Since the 2008 crisis, many investors have flocked to low-volatility funds to the point where the strategy has been “cursed by popularity.” The [valuation metrics](https://mebfaber.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Clipboard01.jpg) ([source](https://mebfaber.com/2016/03/10/what-you-dont-want-to-hear-about-dividend-stocks/)) for these are now higher than their “normal” Value ETF counterparts and the S&amp;P 500 index, indicating lower expected future returns for these low-volatility funds.

[DGRO](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/264623/ishares-core-dividend-growth-etf) from iShares should perform similarly to VIG, with slightly more volatility since it’s more inclusive with its 5-year-growth requirement instead of VIG’s 10-year. As a result, DGRO should have more exposure to comparatively smaller companies than those in VIG. Maybe slightly more reward for slightly more risk. It will be interesting to see going forward. [Here’s a comparison of those](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2019&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=DGRO&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=VIG&amp;allocation2_2=100&amp;total1=100&amp;total2=100&amp;total3=0). Nearly identical, with a tiny bit more volatility, though interestingly VIG had a worse max drawdown during the Q4 2018 correction. Unfortunately DGRO has only been around since 2014.

[NOBL](https://www.proshares.com/funds/nobl.html) from ProShares claims to be the “*only ETF focusing exclusively on the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats—high-quality companies that have not just paid dividends but grown them for at least 25 consecutive years, with most doing so for 40 years or more.*” Its ER of 0.35% is much higher than VIG’s 0.06%. Like DGRO, NOBL may slightly outperform VIG over the long run, albeit with more volatility. [Here’s a backtest](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2019&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=NOBL&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=VIG&amp;allocation2_2=100&amp;total1=100&amp;total2=100&amp;total3=0) comparing NOBL and VIG since NOBL’s inception in late 2013, using the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark. The S&amp;P has actually slightly outperformed NOBL since then, though again the dividend appreciation ETF’s fared better through the Q4 2018 correction with smaller drawdowns.

I did run some of the other popular players in this space - SDY, SPLV, SPHD, DVY, etc. - but they were all very similar and I think VIG beat them on all performance metrics and has the highest AUM by far, so I’m sort of holding VIG as the gold standard in that category of dividend-oriented ETF’s. Though note that these others should have lower valuation metrics than VIG precisely *because* people are flocking to VIG.

For me, a dividend growth tilt retirement pie might look [something like this](https://m1.finance/dm-58cMrL) (M1 pie link) - 90/10 equities/bonds, 10% int’l stock exposure, and 10% REITs - 8% US and 2% int’l.

But since we now know that dividend investing is essentially just a Value tilt and since the high-dividend low-volatility strategy is being “cursed by popularity,” [you may be better off just investing in large-cap Value](https://mebfaber.com/2016/05/02/much-dividends-costing/).

After spending much time researching the subject, Meb Faber succinctly summarizes these points as follows [here](https://mebfaber.com/2017/01/09/high-dividend-stocks-worst/):

1. Dividend yield investing is rooted in value investing.
2. Historically, focusing on dividend yields rather than value, has been a suboptimal way to express value.
3. If you have to focus on dividends, you MUST include a valuation screen or process to avoid high yielding but expensive, junky stocks.
4. The hunt for yield has caused dividend stocks to reach valuations levels never seen before relative to the overall market.
5. Since dividend stocks are currently expensive, we prefer a shareholder yield approach combined with a value composite screen.
6. Once you have a preferred value methodology, AVOIDING dividend stocks in the strategy could result in additional post tax alpha of approximately 0.3% to 4.5% for taxable investors.

He shows in [this table](https://mebfaber.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2.jpg) ([source](https://mebfaber.com/2017/01/09/high-dividend-stocks-worst/)) that investing in Value and ***avoiding*** high dividend payers (far right column) came out ahead in all taxable environments. EW stands for “equal weight.”

If anyone knows of any large-cap value ETF’s or mutual funds that consciously *avoid* high dividend payers, let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**  If you’re set on dividend-orientation, I would say feel free to utilize dividend growth/appreciation stocks and ETF’s like these as a tilt, but please stop chasing dividends **for the sake of the dividend itself**, *especially* in a taxable account.

Specifically, hold high-dividend-payers like REITs in tax-advantaged retirement accounts and reinvest the dividends. Hold low- or non-dividend payers in taxable accounts, reinvest the dividends, and sell shares as needed for income.

54,2019-09-04,HailLibertas,5,Understanding 13F Filings,"Dear all,

I have a question regarding the 13F forms. I find it fascinating to follow the big names in investing and what they are holding - think Buffet or Burry and the likes. I don't do this for blindly investing in positions (I am rather conservative when it comes to investing), but more so because it is exciting.

Now I wanted to ask about 13F forms which are one of my main information sources: I had always assumed they cover all long positions a fund has. Currently there is a lot of discussion about Burry and Gamestop. As of his last Filing in mid Auguts (covering the period up to June 30th, see  [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761919016689/0001567619-19-016689-index.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761919016689/0001567619-19-016689-index.htm)) he seemed to have closed his position in Gamestop.

Did he pick up a large amount of shares once again or am I missing something and the form doesn't actually cover all the long positions?

Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
55,2019-09-03,MountainsMan55,2,Mylan's Lantus copy derailed in U.S. again by manufacturing ills,"When Biocon’s insulin operations in Malaysia won EU approval two weeks ago, it sounded like the company had turned a quality corner. But that turn is not near sharp enough for the FDA, which has issued a second complete response letter (CRL) for the Lantus competitor Biocon developed with Mylan. 

Biocon announced over the weekend that the FDA had issued the CRL to Mylan for the drug approval “pending completion” of improvements at Biocon’s facilities in Malaysia. It was not a big surprise given that the FDA tallied a dozen issues at the three facilities that comprise the manufacturing operation for the drug during a preapproval inspection in June.

“The CRL did not identify any outstanding scientific issues with the application,” Biocon said (PDF) in a public filing. “We remain confident of the quality of our application and do not anticipate any impact of this CRL on the commercial launch timing of our Insulin Glargine in the U.S.”

RELATED: No surprise: FDA hits Mylan and Biocon with CRL for their follow-on copy of Lantus

The whole episode is deja vu for Biocon and Mylan, which received a CRL for the product in June 2018 following an earlier preapproval inspection. In that case, the FDA asked for additional clinical data to support a request to manufacture the insulin injectors at the Malaysia facility instead of at a plant in Bangalore, India, that has had its own issues. 

Biocon and Mylan have won approval of their drug, branded Semglee, in Europe and already launched it in England, but it competes in those markets with copies from Eli Lilly and Merck &amp; Co. 

While the further U.S. delay is a setback for Biocon and Mylan, it doesn’t mean much for Sanofi. That’s because sales of the French drugmaker’s top-selling drug have already been badly eroded by significant price discounting and by competition from Basaglar, the Lantus biosimilar Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim launched in the U.S. in 2016.

56,2019-10-29,beck2047,26,TikTok owner ByteDance eyes initial public offering in Hong Kong," [https://www.ft.com/content/7c1f223e-f721-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65](https://www.ft.com/content/7c1f223e-f721-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65) 

ByteDance, the $75bn Chinese start-up that owns the short-form video app TikTok, is eyeing an initial public offering in Hong Kong as soon as the first quarter of next year, according to two people briefed on its plans.

The seven-year-old company, which also owns the Chinese news app Jinri Toutiao, has chosen Hong Kong over New York, despite the recent turmoil in the territory. The benchmark Hang Seng index has lost about 11 per cent from its high earlier this year amid mass street protests and civil unrest.

ByteDance’s valuation hit $75bn in October 2018 when it closed a $3bn funding round led by SoftBank, doubling its worth from a year earlier. An IPO would crystallise big gains for early investors such as the Chinese arm of Sequoia Capital and would also help SoftBank at a time when the value of its investments in companies such as Uber and WeWork has sharply fallen.

A ByteDance spokesperson said: “There is absolutely zero truth to the rumour that we plan to list in Q1. Full stop.”

One of the few Chinese companies to have made significant inroads into international markets, ByteDance is facing increasing political pressure. In India, politicians have accused TikTok of inciting racial hatred and spreading pornography. The app was briefly banned earlier this year.

In the US, senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton last week called for intelligence officials to investigate TikTok, which has become a teenage craze, over the “national security risks posed by its growing use”.

The company has hired a team at the law firm K&amp;L Gates, which includes Gordon Bart, a former chair of the US House committee on science and technology, to advise on public policy. Its investors are also trying to quell Washington’s opposition to TikTok ahead of the potential listing.

“They need more political heft before they go public,” said one banker briefed on the IPO plans. “Even if they list in Hong Kong, they still need to address the concerns of US investors.”

To minimise the growing US backlash, ByteDance plans to sell TopBuzz, its US news feed business, which has a readership of 300,000, according to a people briefed on the plans.

ByteDance is also hiring a number of former US officials to help it address concerns raised by both Republican and Democratic congressmen in regard to Chinese companies. It is seeking to hire a chief legal officer and staff with Washington connections to push back against concerns ranging from data privacy to whether it is enforcing censorship at the behest of the Chinese government.

These initiatives follow Senator Marco Rubio’s recent calls for a review of ByteDance’s $900m purchase of the [Musical.ly](https://Musical.ly) app in 2017.

TikTok’s success has been powered in part by [Musical.ly](https://Musical.ly)’s technology but Mr Rubio alleged that TikTok has censored news on topics sensitive to China, such as the protests in Hong Kong and alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. ByteDance’s US general manager, Vanessa Pappas, has categorically denied those allegations.

ByteDance reported revenues of between $7bn and $8.4bn for the first half of the calendar year, according to Reuters, and was profitable in the month of June."
57,2019-10-26,InterestingNews1,11,Some interesting news in the stock market this week – big cap stocks,"It was a busy week in the stock market with earnings season under way. There were plenty of reasons for investors to cheer and also some disappointment.

**Growth stocks (Microsoft and PayPal)**

Starting with the good news. Wednesday **Microsoft** beat expectations with revenue and earnings growth of 14% and 24% as the commercial cloud business grew 36% from a year ago. For the fourth quarter revenues  the company indicated it expects a range between $35.15 billion to $35.95 billion, marginally below the consensus at $36.02 billion but still up 11% on last year.

CEO Satya Nadella said on Wednesday “The world’s leading companies are choosing our cloud to build their digital capability”. It seems governments are too after Microsoft announced on Friday that it had won a giant $10 billion cloud contract from the Pentagon. MSFT PE of 18.3 looks cheap.

**PayPal** jumped 11% after the company reported strong earnings after the bell on Wednesday. Revenues were up 19%, earnings up 6% and full year guidance was narrowed to 15% revenue growth. However it was strong growth at mobile payment app Venmo that generated the excitement with  64% growth in payment volume. CEO Dan Schulman said the app was “an incredibly powerful platform for engaging consumers” adding “we see a lot of good runway in front of Venmo”

&amp;#x200B;

**Value stocks**

Intel reported a beat and raise on Thursday that was well received by the market with the stock up 8% on Friday (TTM PE 13.11). CEO Bob Swan said “We’ve been on a multiyear journey to reposition Intel’s portfolio to take advantage of the exponential growth of data”. However, before anyone gets too excited, the full year guidance predicts 0.2% revenue growth and 0.4% earnings growth.  Some analysts said even that “momentum” may not be sustainable as it has been boosted by customers bringing forward orders due to trade and tariff fears.

eBay disappointed on Wednesday as revenues remained flat and gross merchandising volume dropped 4%. The stock fell 9% to a TTM PE of just 16.05. Thats a tempting valuation for an iconic brand like eBay but its becoming increasingly clear that, having long ago lost the ecommerce war to Amazon, the platform is now becoming irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

**A rare disappointment**

More surprising was the initial disappointment with **Amazon’s** Q3 print. Revenue grew 24% but earnings fell 27.5% as shipping costs rose 46%. (Deceleration at AWS was also a concern with 35% revenue growth compared to 46% in Q4 last year).  The stock dropped 7.5% in afterhours trading on Thursday before clawing almost all of that back. It seems investors have concluded that Amazon buying growth through one day delivery is a price worth paying for long term dominance.

&amp;#x200B;

**Short squeeze?**

Finally **Tesla** stock price is up nearly 30% after reporting a surprise profit on Wednesday. Barron’s drew attention to non-recurring items in an article on Thursday. It is impossible to tell (for now) if these were material.  However, the Barron’s article also suggests the pop in the stock price was caused by a short squeeze rather than a meaningful change in sentiment. I would sympathize with that view. A surprise earnings result doesn’t change the fact that Tesla faces huge competition, slowing growth and is trading on a huge valuation. More relevant in my opinion is that revenues fell 7.5%, operating profit fell 37% and earnings fell 33%. 

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody. Please do your own research."

60,2019-10-15,ryeander,1,"WSJ: So You Make $100,000? It Still Might Not Be Enough to Buy a Home."," 

DENVER—For Janessa White, the American dream of a red brick house on a tree-lined street blocks from a good elementary school remains obtainable. She just has to rent it.

Ms. White and her boyfriend moved with her 7-year-old son from Missouri to Denver last year. In Missouri, Ms. White owned her home, which she bought for a little over $100,000. To buy a house like the one she rents in Stapleton, an affluent section of the Colorado capital, would cost about four times as much. Even though her household’s income is in the low six-figures, homeownership is daunting in Denver.

“It’s hard not to want to buy,” she said. “Saving for a huge down payment seems almost impossible.”

Ms. White’s household is part of a growing camp: high-earning Americans who are renting instead of buying homes. In 2019, about 19% of U.S. households with six-figure incomes rented their homes, up from about 12% in 2006, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Census Bureau data that adjusted the incomes for inflation. The increase equates to about 3.4 million new renters who would have likely been homeowners a generation ago.

“I can’t think of anyone we’ve rented to recently who didn’t make $100,000,” said Bruce McNeilage, who owns 148 rental homes around the Southeast and is building 118 more.

[As more people forgo Homeownership,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeownership-rate-drops-for-first-time-in-more-than-two-years-11556220679?mod=article_inline) there is a risk that America’s already-wide wealth gap gets worse. Home-price appreciation has historically been the way most middle-class Americans accumulated wealth. When real-estate values rose steadily in the decades after World War II, middle-class wealth surged, according to a new analysis of consumer survey data from the University of Michigan going back to the late 1940s.

“Houses are the democratic assets, roughly half of housing wealth is owned by the middle class,” said Moritz Schularick, a professor of economics at the University of Bonn and one of the authors.

It isn’t unusual for high-earners to rent in pricey coastal cities like New York and San Francisco, where sky-high real-estate prices have long limited homeownership. Yet these markets account for less than 20% of the new six-figure renters, according to the Journal’s analysis.

 

To accommodate well-off renters, developers have raced to erect luxury apartment buildings around city centers. Investors, meanwhile, have bought hundreds of thousands of suburban houses to turn into rentals and are [increasingly building single-family homes specifically aimed at well-heeled tenants.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-streets-big-landlords-are-so-hungry-for-houses-theyre-building-them-11546511401?mod=article_inline)

The average tenant of the country’s two largest single-family landlords, [Invitation Homes](https://quotes.wsj.com/INVH) Inc. and [American Homes 4 Rent](https://quotes.wsj.com/AMH), now earns $100,000 a year, the companies say. These companies own some 133,000 houses between them[ in attractive neighborhoods with good school districts ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-your-new-landlord-wall-street-1500647417?mod=article_inline)around growing cities, like Houston, Denver and Nashville, Tenn.

In each of those cities as well as in Seattle, Cincinnati and Ann Arbor, Mich., the number of six-figure renters doubled or better between 2006 and 2017, making them the fastest-growing segment of renters in these markets, according to the Journal’s analysis.

During that period, which began just before the housing market imploded in 2007, the number of renter households in the U.S. grew 25% while the number of homeowners was nearly flat, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Since 2017 home buyers have started returning to the market, but not nearly enough of them to offset the decade of new renters.

 

The big home-rental companies are betting that high earners will continue renting. Bankrolled by major property investors like [Blackstone Group](https://quotes.wsj.com/BX) Inc., Starwood Capital Group and Colony Capital Inc., these companies snapped up foreclosed houses with the expectation of [renting them to educated workers who could afford to pay a lot every month but perhaps not buy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-home-rents-put-big-landlords-in-sweet-spot-11564747202?mod=article_inline).

“Very early in this business, we figured out that the cost to replace the HVAC unit is, for the most part, the same on a $1,200 or $1,300 rental as it is on $1,800 or $1,900 rental,” said Dallas Tanner, chief executive and a founder of Invitation Homes.

Six-figure earners tend to be more consistent rent payers, too. Car troubles or a sick child don’t cost them hours at work and income like they can for many lower earners.

High earners also tend to stay put and are willing to absorb regular rent increases if it means not having to move their children to new schools. That translates to lower turnover and maintenance costs for the landlords. “These tenants are treating our houses as if they are their homes,” American Homes CEO David Singelyn said at a real-estate investment conference this summer in New York.

Invitation and American Homes have reported record occupancy and rent growth as well as ever-growing retention as their average renters’ income has risen into six-figure territory.

 

The phenomenon is being felt down the line in the rental-home business and has prompted a rush among investors to buy and build family-sized rental houses around growing cities. Investors, a mix of big and small landlords and house flippers, accounted for more than 11% of U.S. home sales in 2018, their highest share on record, according to [CoreLogic](https://quotes.wsj.com/CLGX) Inc.

A $100,000 income is still comfortably in excess of the median U.S. household income, which was $63,179 in 2018, according to the Census Bureau. But many Americans these days are mired in debt. They have car payments, credit-card debt, health-care bills and college loans. [Student debt is particularly vexing for the younger Americans who are starting families.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-long-road-to-the-student-debt-crisis-11559923730?mod=article_inline)

There is a connection between student loans and the housing bust, which isn’t lost on young home buyers. Many students took out loans because the housing crisis wiped out the equity in their parents’ homes that would have helped pay for college. Since then the amount of student debt outstanding has tripled, to more than $1.6 trillion. A couple of years ago [Fannie Mae](https://quotes.wsj.com/FNMA), the government-sponsored mortgage giant, made it easier for borrowers with higher debt levels to qualify for a mortgage, though recently Fannie tightened its lending standards.

 

Despite the concession, and low unemployment, [the homeownership rate remains stuck about a percentage point below its long-term average of 65% and well below the peak of 69% reached during the last housing bubble.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeownership-rate-drops-for-first-time-in-more-than-two-years-11556220679?mod=article_inline) In the second quarter, there were 78.5 million owner-occupied housing units compared with 43.9 million that were rented, according to the Census Bureau.

Those who do want to buy a home face the additional hurdle of high prices that have surged beyond the reach of even relatively high earners in cities with strong jobs growth. Prices in 75 of the country’s 100 largest metro areas have surpassed their precrash highs, not adjusting for inflation, according to mortgage data and analysis firm HSH. Many of those cities, such as Salt Lake City and Raleigh, N.C., also have some of the fastest growth in high-paying jobs. The sharpest recovery, according to HSH, has been in Denver, where home prices have doubled since 2012 amid an influx of California tech workers and New York finance firms. Prices are nearly twice their precrash high.

 

It takes an annual household income of about $90,000 to afford Denver’s median-priced house, which costs around $471,000, according to HSH. But that is assuming buyers have 20%, or about $94,000, for a down payment.

“The lack of savings for a down payment in this country is grossly underestimated,” said John Pawlowski, a housing analyst at Green Street Advisors, who estimates that the typical renter’s net worth is about $5,500. “Consumer balance sheets are not good.”

In Stapleton, where Ms. White lives, the typical household income is more than $135,000. Tom Cummings, whose company manages some 240 rental homes in the neighborhood, said his typical tenant is a two-income family with children, drawn by the neighborhood’s top-rated schools. Some are recent transplants unsure if they’re staying long-term. Others can’t afford to buy, he said.

 

Houses can be effective wealth builders because most people borrow most of the purchase price. That leverage magnifies gains when prices are rising, but also increases losses when they fall. That explains the big decline in household wealth in the financial crisis and why people are less excited about owning a home today despite otherwise steady appreciation over the decades.

Invitation’s Mr. Tanner likens attitudes toward rental homes to those of leased autos. “Twenty years ago people thought about leasing a car and it was like a bad word. Everyone wanted to own a car,” the 39-year-old CEO said. “Today nobody cares.”

In fact, the idea that homes can lose significant value means people may treat them more like cars, which lose value every year. According to a survey by mortgage finance company [Freddie Mac](https://quotes.wsj.com/FMCC), just 24% of renters said it was “extremely likely” that they would ever own a home, down 11 percentage points from four years ago.

Jacob Neuberger, a 30-year-old who works in Denver for an investment firm, considered buying when he moved out of his one-bedroom downtown apartment. He and his girlfriend opted to rent a townhouse for $2,700 a month. The one next door sold for $550,000. Mr. Neuberger estimated that his costs to own would be about 20% higher than renting and that he would need the townhouse to appreciate by about 10% to cover transaction costs if he needed to sell to buy a bigger home or if he had to move for work. “The price appreciation can’t go on forever,” he said.

 

Madeline Smith, an executive assistant for a local real-estate investor, and her boyfriend, who works in real-estate development, nearly bought a house in Denver two years ago. They had made a quick decision to offer about $25,000 above the asking price under pressure of a bidding deadline. At the inspection, they started adding up the expenses for repairs and upkeep.

“The yard was beautiful, ” Ms. Smith, 29, said. “But who takes care of it? Do we have to come home and take care of it or hire someone? That’s more money.”

The couple backed out and she instead traveled abroad for a few months. When she returned, they rented a luxury apartment downtown and are waiting for asking prices to come down.

Investors are betting many of today’s luxury apartment dwellers will soon be looking for high-end suburban rental homes. Many single-family investors have determined that high-earning renters are willing to pay up to be the first occupants of a rental, which has sparked a boom in built-to-rent homes.

In the second quarter, American Homes 4 Rent added 136 custom-built homes while only purchasing eight existing houses, the first period in which the company built more than it bought. The Agoura Hills, Calif. company estimates that it will spend as much as $900 million this year and next adding properties to its stable, mostly building them with high earners in mind.

 

Executives say they’ll be building around Denver, where its $2,195 average rent is the highest in its portfolio by more than $300 a month, as well as in other booming Western cities like Seattle, Salt Lake City and San Antonio.

Just off San Antonio’s main freeway and across the street from one of its top high schools, the newly built Pradera community features tidy houses big enough for a family, typical of many subdivisions. But they are available only to rent.

For Lakisha Caldwell, the community offers suburban living that is mortgage-free and maintenance-light. “We don’t have to cut our own grass. We don’t have to worry about changing the lightbulb,” she said.

Pradera, where the typical tenant earns above $100,000 a year, will eventually include 250 rental homes. It is one of several single-family-rental communities developed by AHV Communities LLC and Bristol Group.

Mark Wolf, CEO of Irvine, Calif.-based AHV, said he looks for plots of land near good schools, employment centers and transportation corridors where well-off families might be able to afford to rent but not yet buy.

“Most people don’t have $5,000 or $10,000 to put down on a house,” he said.

Ms. Caldwell, who is 32 years old and works for a medical-device company, and her husband have been renting since moving to San Antonio eight years ago. They have a 10-year old son, two rescue dogs and two foster children.

“Some people make me feel bad about renting. They say, ‘Oh my goodness, you spend all this money on renting,’” she said. She has no desire to become a homeowner at the moment. “I don’t want to do what the Joneses are doing.”"
61,2019-10-08,fuzzyaces,18,Splunk Financials and Underlying Story,"Following my last post, I received a request to take a deeper dive into Splunk (SPLK), a rapidly growing company in the IT Operations Management (ITOM) space. 

One quick note before I kick off, I might reorganize these posts just to give them a bit more structure, which may evolve as time goes on.

**Industry**

Splunk fits within an interesting niche of the ITOM space. Their specialization is part of an area focused on machine learning and big data for logging, monitoring, and reporting IT Operations. To quote from [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3892967?ref=mrktg-srch) and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/09/the-big-problem-with-big-data/#4d89199723b1), ""By 2022, 40% of all large enterprises will combine big data and machine learning functionality to support and partially replace monitoring, service desk and automation processes and tasks."" Given the upside, there are a ton of [vendors](https://blog.opsramp.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog_images/AIOps%20Vendor%20Landscape@2x-100.jpg?width=3840&amp;name=AIOps%20Vendor%20Landscape@2x-100.jpg) craming into a very crowded market. In [Gartner's](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3939625/market-share-analysis-itom-performance-analysis-software) most recent report, the market size is $5.2B and grew at 12% YoY, also [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190423005350/en/Splunk-Increases-Market-Share-Gartner’s-Performance-Analysis). 

**Revenue**

For Splunk, their (reported) revenue is broken down into 3 main categories: Licensing, Maintenance and Services, and Cloud. The License line is a one-time payment for a perpetual license for on-premise deployment of the Splunk Enterprise suite, while the maintenance and service and cloud license pay an annual subscription fee, which is tiered based on the amount of data ingested. Their revenue is rapidly transitioning from the perpetual license to the their annual subscription as they said in their most recent [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/22/splunk-inc-splk-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx) ""We expect the elimination of perpetual license sales will accelerate renewable mix to 99% in Q4 and high 90s for the full-year."" [seen here](https://imgur.com/CX7RqQ).

This transition has a bit of uncertainty around it. Exabeam, one of Splunk's competitors in the SIEM space, recently [mentioned](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/06/14/exabeams-fast-growth-not-slowing-down-splunk/#70e6bad1c36b) that customers are unable to predict their expenditure since Splunk prices based on data ingested, which can be a varying target. Additionally, the cloud transition provides a more sticky cash flow for the company, but will provide short-term pain since the amounts are billed annually vs. entirely upfront. While this might help customers from an initial expenditure outlay (potentially removing one of the roadblocks), it is the reason that Splunk recently revised their cash flow forecast from a positive $250mm inflow to a negative $300mm outflow (despite raising annual guidance from $2.25B to $2.3B). 

The critical KPI for the company here is their [Remaining Performance Obligations](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/4333fe85-6fc8-40cc-b56d-60e4527281cb), which is non-cancellable (future) contracted revenue. In 2Q20, the RPO was [$1.235B](https://imgur.com/pr7Rxh7), with 61% of that to be recognized over the next twelve months ($753mm). The average contract duration for the contracts signed have hovered just shy of 3 years (33 months). One concerning metric in their most recent quarter was that the contract bookings slowed dramatically in the most recent quarter, $554mm, which is only a 19% growth rate.

Finally, Splunk just [closed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000141057819001502/tv530497_8k.htm) on their acquisition of SignalFX on October 1st, so guidance and RPO will likely look dramatically different in Q3 and Q4 as the company represents a combined platform.

**Costs**

From a cost perspective, the company's costs have stayed broadly consistent with [topline growth](https://imgur.com/hOrLe5P). On an LTM basis, the company has ~$1.8B of expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. The number of employees has grown from 2,700, to 3,200, to 4,400, to 4,700 from Jan-2017, Jan-2018, to Jan-2019, and today respectively. Assuming an average total compensation of [$261,231](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000120677419001555/splk3465081-def14a.htm#CEOPayRatio), accounts for ~$1.15B of those expenses or ~72% for FY19. This has remained relatively constant for 2015 to current.

As a result, cloud margins are improving, as 2Q20 reached a 50% margin, nearing their 70% gross margin target. Research and Development has remained relatively constant at 15 - 17.5% of sales, sales and marketing at 45% - 50% of sales, and G&amp;A at ~10% of sales. These percentages strip out stock-based compensation, but since there is no breakdown, still include D&amp;A. 

**Capitalization**

Splunk is well funded with 2 convertible senior notes (convertible at $148.30) for a total debt of $2.1B, but has $2.7B in cash and investments. This gives the company a great war-chest to continue to acquire companies in the space. The company has acquired [7 companies](https://imgur.com/xW8hmli) in the past 2 years, with the most notable being SignalFX, augmenting their suite of products in the monitoring segment. 

**Returns**

Over the last 4 - 5 quarters, Splunk's return on capital has settled into the [5 - 10% range](https://imgur.com/hOrLe5P). Given their reinvestment rate of ~150% (math from [here on p 26](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/ovhds/dam2ed/growthandtermvalue.pdf)), this implies a sustainable EBIT growth rate of 7 - 10%. To me, this passes the smell test since it's broadly consistent with the industry growth predicted by IDC and Gartner, implying that Splunk's organic revenue growth will continue and acquisitions should provide further juice to the topline growth rate. 

**Outlook**

Splunk issued guidance of $2.3B for FY2020, with $600mm in Q3 (implying ~$760mm in Q4). Wall street is right in line with guidance for 2020, and showing $2.8B for 2021 (or a 22% growth rate). The challenge for the company will be to weather the transition from the upfront payment to the cloud subscriptions, since that will depress cash flow for the next year or two. The company even noted on their last [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/22/splunk-inc-splk-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx) that their target cash flow yield won't be realized until after 2021.

TL;DR Splunk is a rapidly growing player in the IT Operations Management space that is growing dramatically and starting the shift into turning their revenue stream into longer-term contracts. As the company transitions, it will depress cash flow in the near-term, but could accelerate onboarding as it manages the initial expense outlay for customers.

64,2019-11-29,veritasinvestments,1,"ACST, the next Amarin?","Hi folks, as some of you know, Amarin had a great run from 2 to 20 when it released data back in the day. With that said, Amarin's not the only company that has an interest in using Omega-3's for reducing triglyceride levels. I think that the next company that is the closest to riding a wave like Amarin is Acasti. Acasti's capre had a fantastic phase 2 and is currently about to release two phase 3 studies (TRILOGY 1 and 2, in december and january) that are aimed to show the power of capre for reducing triglyceride levels in patients with high triglyceride levels. I think that current market cap (170 million) is severely undervalued given that its competitor has around a 7.6 billion market cap. Amarin's Vascepa is up for an FDA approval, and given the positivity of the adcom vote, it will most likely get a nice FDA approval. While this may not provide much of an upside for Amarin (it already has a 7.6 billion market cap), I think it will serve as another catalyst for Acasti. Furthermore, if Amarin gets BO, Acasti may also get BO by another big company that wants to have a slice of the pie. Essentially, Amarin has done a fantastic job at paving the way for what the market cap of a company with an omega 3 drug can look like, and even if Acasti achieves 1/5 of Amarin's current evaluation, its PT will be 18-20 after the phase 3 studies get rolled out. You can't buy options, but a share is going at around $2 dollars. I have locked in some shares and I think that it's a good bet that this will get a huge boost after phase 3's roll out."
65,2019-11-25,Winston_II,1,Winston's Weekly Investment Ideas,"**Buy, Sell or Hold?**

The markets have not been going anywhere for the past week. Therefore, it's timely to think about where it's heading next.

The ""Optimists"" are saying that the markets can head higher for the following reasons:-  
1. Earnings season is about over and the companies can again buy back their shares  
2. Phase One of the Trade War will be signed by early next year. (It was supposed to be at the APEC Meeting in Chile on Nov 17).  
3. Interest rates are low and getting lower  
4. If there's a plunge in the markets, the Central Banksters will rescue it by printing more money  
5. The consumers are still spending money  
6. Year End Window Dressing is coming up  
7. Trump will not be impeached. And even if he's impeached, wouldn't that be good for the markets?

On the other hand, the ""Pessimists"" are worried of the following:-  
1. Earnings season will be over soon so there's no more catalyst to push the markets higher. And if the companies are not making that much money, would they be buying back their shares. They can only borrow so much to buy back their shares.  
2. Even if Phase One is signed, the damage to the global economy is already done. And why would anyone buy Equities just because Phase One is signed?  
3. Interest rates are already very low and lowering them further would not have much effect on things. Japan has been stagnating for 30 years with low interest rates.  
4. The Central Banksters printed about US$16t over the past 10 years, to save the global economy from the Subprime Crisis. Do they really have much firepower left for the next economic crisis, especially when the debt is so much higher this round?  
5. The consumers are no longer splurging on big ticket items while Corporations are no longer spending heavily to expand.  
6. What is going to happen after the ""Santa Rally, Year End Window Dressing and the January Effect""? Isn't it a good time to sell in late December?  
7. The politics in Washington has already damaged the global economy.

In view of the above, I think that it's still ""safe"" to trade the markets for the next two weeks or so, unless Trump decides to increase the tariffs on December 15.

And if ""Phase One' do get signed in early 2020, it could extend this ""Trading Market"" for a few more weeks.

Thereafter, a coordinated QE by the Central Banksters, is needed to extend this economic ""boom"" beyond the November Presidential Election.

On the horizon, we have the following:-  
1. Trump's Impeachment Circus  
2. HK District Council Elections  
3. New Money For The New Month of December

66,2019-11-05,ryeander,1,Ready to Boost Stocks: Investors’ Multitrillion Cash Hoard (The Wall Street Journal)," [https://www.wsj.com/articles/ready-to-boost-stocks-investors-multitrillion-cash-hoard-11572958800?mod=hp\_lead\_pos4](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ready-to-boost-stocks-investors-multitrillion-cash-hoard-11572958800?mod=hp_lead_pos4) 

 

Nervous investors have socked $3.4 trillion away in cash. But stocks are rising and their nerves are calming, leading bulls to view the huge cash pile as fuel that could drive markets higher still.

Assets in money-market funds have grown by $1 trillion over the last three years to their highest level in around a decade, according to Lipper data. A variety of factors are fueling the flows, from higher money-market rates to concerns over the health of the 10-year economic expansion and an aging [bull market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-did-this-bull-market-come-from-anyway-11564766200?mod=article_inline).

 

Yet some analysts say the heap of cash shows that investors haven’t grown excessively exuberant despite markets’ double-digit gains this year, and have plenty of money available to buy when lower prices prevail. That is a comforting message to those concerned about an economic slowdown yet wary of betting against a market that has punished doubters during its 10-year run.

“Cash always makes me feel good, both having it and seeing it on the sidelines,” said Michael Farr, president of the money-management firm Farr, Miller &amp; Washington, which is holding twice as much cash as usual. “It keeps things a little bit safer.”

Investors said the rising cash reserves reflect several worries that have become prevalent among money managers over recent months, as flare-ups in the [trade war with China](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-u-s-and-china-looking-for-new-site-to-sign-trade-deal-11572530346?mod=article_inline) and uneven U.S. data sparked [bouts of volatility](https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-volatility-wagers-hit-markets-11569427758?mod=article_inline) in markets.

Many are concerned that stock prices have climbed to unsustainable levels relative to companies’ earnings at a time when the [U.S. economy is slowing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-economy-grew-at-1-9-rate-in-third-quarter-11572438761?mod=article_inline). A popular metric pioneered by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller shows that valuations remain near two-decade highs, though they have retreated from their heights of early 2018.

 

Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at the $2 billion Villere Balanced Fund, is keeping 17% of his portfolio as cash, up from the usual 10%. Mr. Villere believes valuations have become stretched and prefers to wait for another dip before jumping in again.

“We don’t have to swing at every pitch,” said Mr. Villere, who added two new stockholdings to his portfolio when markets slid last December. “Right now, we’re struggling to find high quality at reasonable prices.”

Rising yields in money markets have been another key factor. Money-market funds through October offered an average annual return of around 1.6% this year, up from 0.02% in 2011, according to Crane Data. Sweep accounts at brokerages, the main reservoir where these firms hold clients’ cash, paid about 0.2% on average through September.

 

When interest rates fell in the years after the financial crisis, bank deposits gained market share from money-market funds because the gap between the yields on both had narrowed so much, said Peter Crane, president and publisher of Crane Data.

Money-market rates rose in response to the Fed’s nine interest rate increases since 2015 and have declined in recent months to reflect the central bank’s [rate reductions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-cuts-rates-by-quarter-point-11572458556?mod=article_inline) this year.

Higher rates, together with a comparatively high degree of liquidity, has increased money markets’ allure for investors looking to park their cash for a comparatively short period.

Some fund managers have warned investors against being overly cautious in a market that has shrugged off a range of economic and geopolitical worries over the past decade and continues to edge higher. A UBS Global Wealth Management survey of 4,600 wealthy entrepreneurs and investors showed that more than a third raised their cash allocations in the past quarter in response to flaring trade worries.

 

In total, cash holdings rose a percentage point to 27% of survey respondents’ portfolios at the end of the third quarter from the previous quarter, even as a growing number said they were increasingly optimistic on the global economy and stock performance. The cash allocation is much higher than the percentage recommended by the firm.

“There is a dichotomy in sentiment—investors are holding large cash balances in a wait-and-see mode, even though nearly 50% anticipate higher stock market returns in the next six months,” said Paula Polito, UBS Global Wealth Management’s client strategy officer, in a recent report.

The difference between combined flows into cash and bond funds relative to stocks over the past year is the greatest since 2012, after adjusting for assets under management, according to Goldman Sachs.

 

In a historical context, however, stock allocations remain large. The firm estimates that investors have about 12% of their portfolios in cash, ranking in just the fifth percentile going back to 1990. By contrast, stock allocations are at roughly 44%—equivalent to the 81st percentile going back the past three decades.

Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, see the cash pile as an indication that markets have plenty of fuel for more gains.

The bank’s proprietary Cash Rule Indicator, which gives a buy signal on stocks when investors’ cash balances are above their long-term averages, has been in bullish territory for the last 20 months. Fund managers polled in the bank’s latest survey said they are holding an average of 5% of their portfolios in cash. That compares with a 10-year average of 4.6%.

“We take it as an incredibly positive sign on a contrarian basis,” said Jared Woodard, investment strategist at the bank."
67,2019-12-30,DevonAllary,1,Guide to Leveraged ETFs,"Most people who do enough research into finance and the stock market will come to the realization that picking stocks is difficult and that passive investing is the probably best strategy for consistent long run performance. Even Warren Buffett, the greatest investor of all time, [doubts that active managers can consistently outperform the market](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/03/why-warren-buffett-says-index-funds-are-the-best-investment.html). Go to any personal finance subreddit (aside from wallstreetbets) and you’ll see the same “just buy VOO” advice in nearly every thread.

Obviously, there’s good reason for why the market outperforms individual investors. A lot of novice investors take oversized positions in individual stocks, which exposes their portfolios to a lot of unsystematic risk. Even if they do get lucky in the short run and beat the market’s return, unless they have some informational edge, it’s nearly impossible to consistently get lucky over a 40 year period, and taking on *excess* risk over such a long holding period is generally considered bad. 

The S&amp;P 500 is about as close to the “market portfolio” as you can get and has virtually no unsystematic risk. According to modern portfolio theory, this makes it the most efficient portfolio: i.e. it has the highest return for its level of risk. This is what William Sharpe found in [his 1964 paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1964.tb02865.x), which helped him win the 1990 Nobel Prize. Something else Dr. Sharpe found is that leverage does not actually impact the Sharpe Ratio. While a levered ETF is riskier than an unlevered ETF, the returns should be proportionately higher because the risk you’re taking on is systematic risk. One of the recommendations from the paper is that the optimal investment strategy is to only invest in the market portfolio and use leverage to reach your desired level of risk. 

A 3x Levered ETF on the S&amp;P 500 (I’m just going to call it “UPRO” from now on) would have a 14% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) since the 1950s compared to the S&amp;P’s 7% CAGR. That’s a pretty phenomenal return. An investment of $10,000 made 40 years ago would be worth around $9,000,000 today.

A lot of pundits and experts warn against using levered ETF for anything other than a one day holding period, and while there are significant risks, the long run performance is very impressive. In fact, it might be a better way to invest aggressively than more typical aggressive strategies like small cap stocks, growth stocks, or picking individual stocks. That being said, it’s worth exploring some of the risks. 

# RISKS

**1. Total Loss**

You could lose all your money in a single day with a levered ETF. For a 2x levered ETF, you’d need a drop in the underlying of 50%, and for a 3x levered ETF, you’d need a drop of 33%. Will this happen? It’s possible, but based on historical data, it’s not very likely. Below are the five largest daily percentage losses in a single day. Only one of these occurred in the last 50 years, and all are significantly far off from 33%.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|% Change|
|:-|:-|
|1987-10-19|\-20.47|
|1929-10-28|\-12.34|
| 1929-10-29 |\-10.15|
| 1929-11-06 |\-9.92|
| 1937-10-18 |\-9.27|

**2. Volatility Drag**

This is the number one reason I see people avoiding levered ETFs. Levered ETFs magnify gains and losses by the same factor. A 1% gain becomes a 3% gain, and a 1% loss becomes a 3% loss. However, losses have a bigger impact than gains (you need a 1.01% gain to recover from a 1% loss and a 100% gain to recover from a 50% loss). In a sideways market, a levered ETF will actually lose value because the losses overpower the gains. 

In practice, though, the daily fluctuations in market price don’t have that big of an impact on the annual gains. If you regress a UPRO’s annual returns again stthe annual return of the S&amp;P multiplied by 3, you’ll see that 95% of the variance is explained by the annual return of the S&amp;P multiplied by 3. Most of UPRO’s annual performance is explained by the S&amp;P’s annual performance, and not the daily fluctuations. 

Annual volatility drag is an issue, though. The average return (arithmetic mean) of UPRO since the 1950s is about 26%, while the compound growth rate (geometric mean) is 14%, so you lose 12 percentage points to volatility drag.

The S&amp;P is the least volatile of the major indices because it’s value weighted, unlike the DJIA, and it’s not as concentrated in a single industry like the Nasdaq. It’s also the closest to the theoretical “market portfolio”, so it should be the best underlying asset for a levered ETF.

**3. Massive Drawdowns**

This is probably the biggest risk. In 2009, UPRO would have lost 86% of its value, and in 1974, it would have lost 70% of its value. Losses a very punishing to Levered ETFs, and it can take a lot longer for them to recover compared to the normal ETF. However, in 95% of 20 year holding periods between 1955 and today, UPRO would have outperformed the S&amp;P. Only consider these investments if you have a very long holding period and are comfortable taking on more risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**Timing the market**

Since levered ETFs are so sensitive to business cycles, it might seem tempting to try to time the market. However, timing a 3x levered ETF is just as difficult as timing a normal ETF. I think the same advice of “time in the market beats timing the market” applies.

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** Leveraged ETFs could be a good long run strategy for higher returns, but there are significant risks. Don’t invest any money in these that you can’t afford to lose."
68,2019-12-22,andrewmccabe3,1,Is LuLu Lemon a good buy?,"LULU stock gapped out of a flat base on Sept. 6. The buy point was 194.35. It was an early-stage base because a 33% pullback for LULU stock late last year served to reset the base count. The 5% buy zone went up to 204.07.


But Lululemon stock started moving sideways immediately after the breakout. Another flat base formed with a 204.54 entry. LULU stock cleared the buy point, but sellers came into the stock and Lululemon paid a visit to its 50-day moving average. It found support and reclaimed the buy point soon after.


Headed into earnings, LULU stock was well past the 5% buy zone from the 204.54 entry. The stock is not a buy now, but it's not a broken stock either as it continues to hold above the buy point and its 50-day moving average, a key support level. If LULU eventually pulls back to its 50-day moving average and bounces off the support level with conviction, it would give another buy area.

LULU Stock: Fundamental Analysis
Lululemon's Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, ranks it No. 1 in its industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The rating is helped by strong price performance over the past 12 months, plus a consistent track record of earnings and sales growth.


Lululemon's core women's business continues to thrive, but the company also has expanded successfully into the men's category, as well as new markets like Europe and Asia.

Earlier this year, Lululemon outlined a five-year growth plan that analysts lauded. The company plans to more than double men's revenue by 2023, while expanding its women's and accessories business. The retailer also said it expects to double its digital revenue and quadruple international sales.

The company has a three-year annualized earnings growth rate of 35% and sales growth rate of 19%. In fiscal 2019, annual return on equity jumped to 33.8% from 23.9% in 2018. Annual pretax margin also expanded nicely to 21.8%.

Another Solid Earnings Report
Lululemon's latest earnings report showed another quarter of strong bottom-line and top-line growth. Adjusted profit rose 28% from the year-ago quarter to 96 cents a share. Sales growth accelerated for the second straight quarter, up 23% to $883.4 million. Sales for its men's business were up 38%.

But the company forecast holiday sales of $1.315 to $1.33 billion, below the consensus estimate of $1.38 billion.

Chipotle Leads These 5 Consumer Stocks In Or Near Buys As Confidence Rises
FacebookTwitterLinkedIn
BILL PETERS 08:00 AM ET 12/21/2019
Your stocks to watch this week come courtesy of the strong labor and stock markets, which have helped lift consumer-facing companies. They include fast-casual chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), mattress maker Tempur Sealy (TPX) and fitness chain Planet Fitness (PLNT). Chipotle stock is in buy range, while Planet Fitness and Tempur Sealy are near but not yet in buy range.

  
Meanwhile, Brazilian airline Azul (AZUL) is also in a base. So is Euronet Worldwide (EEFT), an electronic payments provider and ATM operator. Most of these stocks are taking a breather after reaching record highs.

The buoyant mood among consumers is underscored by the latest IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, which soared 7.8% to 57 in December, the highest since May.

Chipotle Stock
Chipotle stock broke out from a cup-with-handle base with an 828.55 buy point earlier this month. Shares ended 0.7% above that level on the stock market on Friday. The ""breakout"" was more of a gentle nudge, with volume below average. It could be that CMG stock will find more resistance at 858, just above its all-time high.

Chipotle stock has an 83 Composite Rating. Its EPS Rating, a gauge of profit growth, is 73.


After foodborne illness issues in 2015 shredded the stock, Chipotle ran higher for much of 2019. But after touching a record high, Chipotle stock cooled off in September. In the process, its relative strength line dropped. The relative strength line compares a stock's performance to the S&amp;P 500.

However, the rangebound trading in recent weeks could mean that skeptics have stepped aside, potentially clearing the way for a bigger breakout.

Cowen analyst Andrew Charles in November named Chipotle stock one of his ""best ideas"" for 2020. He said Chipotle's digital sales potential, loyalty program and new drive-thru Chipotlanes would help drive growth. Greater demand for transparency in how restaurants make their food would also help, he said.

""The company has been on an outstanding run with CEO Brian Niccol at the helm, achieving growth that has far surpassed our expectations,"" Charles wrote in a research note last month.

""Unlike most competitors, virtually every Chipotle location has a second assembly line to provide capacity for digital orders, that are now fully digitized for faster prep times,"" he said later in the note.

Tempur Sealy Stock
Tempur Sealy stock is in a base-one-base pattern and 3.3% below a 92.43 buy point.

Like Chipotle stock, Tempur Sealy spent much of 2019 on an uptrend. The stock appeared to plateau in August. But Tempur Sealy stock jumped on Oct. 31 following its most recent quarterly earnings. A day later, it reached a record high. The stock has since settled into a tighter trading pattern.


Shares have a 97 Composite Rating, out of a possible 99, and an 82 EPS Rating. IBD generally encourages investors to focus on stocks with Composite Ratings in the 90s. Its relative strength line shows that is has largely performed in line with the broader market in recent months.

The company is best known for its Tempur-Pedic and Sealy beds. Tempur-Sealy has booked gains by focusing more on higher-end mattress and away from cheaper, bed-in-a-box mattresses more prone to competitive price-slashing. However, its debt-to-equity ratio is 745%, according to MarketSmith.

""There are plenty of bedding outlets, for lack of a better word, in the United States,"" Chief Executive Scott Thompson told IBD this year. ""But what wasn't being served was the high-end customer. You certainly had lots of Chevys. But there weren't any Lexus dealerships, or very few.""

Planet Fitness Stock
Planet Fitness stock is in a cup-with-handle base and 3.3% below a 76.07 buy point. Shares have a 76 Composite Rating. However, the stock's EPS Rating is a strong 98.

Shares peaked in June, slid lower, and then rebounded to form their current cup-with-handle pattern. Planet Fitness reported better-than-anticipated third-quarter earnings in November. But the RS line for Planet Fitness stock is well below its mid-May peaks.


William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia has said the company benefits from a ""generational tailwind as almost half its members are millennials"" and franchised business that runs on membership dues. However, she said that Planet Fitness faces heavy competition.

The holiday season is key for Planet Fitness as New Year's resolutions to lose weight spur people to exercise more and join gyms.

Meanwhile, emerging potential rival Peloton (PTON), which sells stationary exercise bikes for home with a subscription-based workout model, recently botched a holiday-sales ad campaign.

Euronet Worldwide Stock
Euronet stock tiptoed out of a cup-with-handle base with a 159.36 buy point intraday Friday but closed 0.5% below the pivot. Euronet has a solid 87 Composite Rating and a strong 98 EPS Rating.

The company handles transactions at more than 40,000 ATMs and nearly 300,000 point-of-sale terminals across Europe, the Asia-Pacific and Middle East, according to its annual report. It also offers money-transfer services and prepaid services."

70,2019-12-17,vgambit,1,There's something to be said about common sense investing. Moved all of my holdings to green (and low-rated) investments 3 months ago. They're up 3% overall since then.,"Earlier this year, I read an article (that I can't seem to find now). In it, there was a section where Jeremy Grantham said that 98% of his personal holdings were in sustainable investments: solar panels, batteries, beans, and the like. His logic was that the current market values, where oil that we can't burn is seen as highly valuable, are completely skewed, and not based in reality. He said that, essentially, either he's right, and he profits greatly, or he's wrong, and it doesn't matter, because humanity dies out.

It took me several months to get around to it, but I finally moved everything in my 401k to sustainable investments. Half in MMFs, half in the one green MMF I could choose.  Almost all of the funds I chose had low ratings; one, maybe 2 stars out of 5 that the service showed. Funds in oil, big data, and other nonsense I strongly disagree with had 4 and 5 stars.

They were down 1% for a while, but for the past few weeks, they've been up by 2%, and now close to 3%. They're all at or very close to 52-week highs.

The logic is pretty much as follows: put your money in industries that stand to grow as legislation catches up to what we need to do collectively to keep the world habitable. That means out of things like oil, and into things like, well, solar panels, batteries, and beans.

I understand that the value may drop again, but, from a common sense perspective, they stand to increase pretty drastically in the long term."
71,2019-12-08,DanielAdelodun,1,Can markets jump up in value 30%+ of the course of a week?,"I think that next week will be a very volatile week.   
In the background, you already have worldwide protests, the renewed rise of Rocketman with backed by a more hostile China, the forgotten inverted yield curve (which yes has un-inverted, but also yields inverted and un-inverted months before the last crashes), central bank shenanigans, low-quality IPOs, and corporate and household debt crises to go along with the government and student debt crises.

Next week there's the UK elections, we will see the market reaction to recent weak German/European data that came recently, and then there's the big US trade decision on the 15th. 

No-one can predict when a crash will come, and tbh none of those things above really affect a business' bottom line - but if an investor had to pick a week to steer clear of markets, I can't imagine anyone getting fired for choosing this week. Not a huge amount of difference between realizing those 30% year-to-date gains vs. waiting a week for 35%.

I \*can\* imagine people kicking themselves for getting too greedy and not seeing this coming. We are currently at ATHs - yeah the economy is doing good, but the stock market has been doing disproportionately better. Is Apple really worth 10% more than it was last year? Is the iPhone 11 10% better, or more popular than the 10 was? Does it make sense that there are 5 billion pieces of paper on the planet that say 'You have part ownership of Apple' and each is worth $200? Would you be willing to explain to people why each SHOULD be worth $200 each if suddenly everyone else decided they weren't? 

Am I fearmongering? Yes, I kind of am. But this really is how I feel, and I wanted to share my thoughts. So don't take this too seriously, I know the world isn't ending."

73,2019-12-03,AllDayWarrenBuffett,1,"If today's big tech is a bubble like railroads in the 1800s and telecom equipment in the 1990s, what will rise from the ashes after it pops?","Tech bubbles are nothing new. Some research indicates that when tech bubbles pop, they leave behind cheap and ubiquitous resources to help fuel the next wave of tech investment. In the 1850s, there was overinvestment in railroads. When that bubble popped, it set the stage for a massive expansion in affordable freight transportation and eventually the industrial economy. In the 1990s, there was massive overinvestment in telecom infrastructure. When that bubble popped, it left behind a glut of dirt-cheap telecom infrastructure (mostly fiber optic cable) that allowed the today's internet giants to grow quickly without having to pay a lot for previously-expensive physical resources. Let's say today's tech economy -- with its massive investments in data aggregation, automation, and algorithm development -- is a bubble. I'm not interested in debating whether this is true. What I'm interested in is: if that bubble pops and leaves behind cheap assets (data pools, algorithms, etc), which industries or companies are most likely to profit from that glut of resources?"
