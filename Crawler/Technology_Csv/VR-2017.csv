0,2017-01-26,gambit270,2,Hugo Barra is swapping China for Facebook.,"After leaving Google (GOOGL, Tech30) nearly four years ago to work at Chinese startup Xiaomi, the tech executive is returning to Silicon Valley to become head of virtual reality at Facebook (FB, Tech30).
Facebook spent around $2 billion in 2014 to buy virtual reality gaming company Oculus VR, with Zuckerberg saying at the time it would help his company build a ""new communication platform.""
He reiterated that view on Wednesday, declaring that virtual and augmented reality will ""enable us to experience completely new things and be more creative than ever before.""

1,2017-01-26,SuperDuperComputer,1,Acquiring my business for shares in a company,"Hi,
I'm hoping to get some advice about shares.  I have a small sole trader business and a bigger company wants to employ me fulltime and acquire my business in exchange for 200K in shares (2%) of their 10 Million$ business.  They began as a startup 2 years ago and have built up quickly, they are a service provider business in VR production (i.e. they create VR experiences for commercials, tourism, and some original IP).  What I'm wondering is, what kind of real value would shares in a service provider company like this actually have?  Sure they may grow in size, but they are not producing the next Instagram so I can't imagine  they will ever get bought out.  And if not, then would I even be able to sell my shares?  Say my shares grew to double the value,  would anyone actually want to pay for shares in a 20 million dolar service provider company or would I just be stuck with them?
Thanks for your advice, much appreciated"
2,2017-01-25,kingmon107,5,Fastest Growers in 2017,"Which stocks do you believe will crush the S&amp;P in 2017 and why?

Mine:

$FB - social media monopoly, endless messenger possibilities just look at WeChat in China (plus they own WhatsApp), small business booming will mean increased advertising, VR might break out

$TSLA - trump and elon relationship, battery facilities, EV growth, fanboy sentiment

$TK - oil tanker that I picked up for cheap - has been ripping since trump

Watching these smaller guys, both in a way dependent on trump (now with his EPA targeting), both good fundamentals:

$HDSN - refrigerant gas company; driven by recycling and refilling the tanks the gas comes in, EPA already passed law requiring refillment by 2020, under-followed

$CETX - environmental technology company; good fundamentals, strong business and growth, under-followed

3,2017-01-15,way_too_optimistic,0,My number 1a and 1b stocks for 2017,"I'm convinced that NVDA and TSLA will be two top growing stocks for 2017.  Despite recent expolsion in NVDA stock price, their earnings have kept P/E reasonable for a company with great potential growth.  NVDA deals in 4 major areas: gaming, VR, automobiles (I might be a little off).  The market dramatically undersestimates the earnings growth NVDA will ahve in the automotive sector :D  I see TSLA and others coming along for the ride.  TSLA is also going to have success because Elon Musk has constantly turned companies to gold.  While past success doesn't guarantee future returns, I think it's a good bet.  Anthing below ~255 is a good price for TSLA right now IMO.

7,2017-02-14,BlindTiger86,0,Is $SNE the VR Play?,"Background: I grew up playing video games about as much as the next guy, Madden, T Woods, Bond, Halo - the good stuff. 

Now until this past weekend I haven't really touched a video game or console in maybe 5 years, it was just no longer interesting to me or a good way for me to spend my time. 

Fast forward to last Sunday and my buddy had recently bought the Playstation 4 with the VR set up, and man, that sh*t was fun! The range of games I think applies to everyone too as my girlfriend was really enjoying the experience as well. 

Which leads me to this: I think VR is going to be a revolution in the space.  What is the best way to play this from an investing standpoint?  Is it $SNE, is it the game makers, the chip makers, $MSFT?

The thing with $SNE and $MSFT is that the game consoles are only individual segments of their overall business models, so growth there could be muted by other aspects of the various companies.  What do you guys think? What's the best way to play it?

8,2017-02-08,ScottyDntKnow,0,What is the best way (if possible) to invest in a company traded on a foreign exchange. (HTC: TW.2498),"So I have only recently gotten around to finally getting a good grasp on my finances and there is a lot to investing/trading that I am still learning.  

Working on zeroing in my portfolio balance and feel very comfortable with my current investments and risk allotments.  

I do however want to not have all my eggs in one basket (USA) with some potential uncertainty over the next 4 years expected, and want to increase my exposure to other markets to hedge potential losses for a country-wide downturn. 

After seeing the HTC Vive in person (and being a lifelong gamer who grew up in the good old 90s), I see the future of gaming being VR in the 5-10 year range.  In the race to dominate this market between HTC and Occulus, I have the utmost faith in Steam, with the belief that there is a realitively good chance that facebook tries to overregulate with DRM and exclusive titles, that they alienate the PC userbase... and that in the long run the Vive beats Occulus.  

Which leads me sitting here scratching my head about how the hell do I go about doing something about this.  Currently I have been using etrade to do my trading, so not sure if there is a way to do it through there.  Still a realities novice to all this and I can use any advice or guidance you all might have."

11,2017-03-23,AdamtoZ,0,Building a Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality portfolio,"Hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you clicked this I assume you are on the same mindset slightly about the future. Not looking for criticism on my decisions. Just looking for more businesses or side part manufacturers that I may not have thought of. There are infinite capabilities to this technology with huge potential growth. For those who have read the book ""Ready Player One"" you will know the very real capabilities this industry is aiming at. For those who don't, there is a movie coming out in 2018 I think...

I am pivoting my entire portfolio into a long term VR/AR focus. 

My portfolio so far includes: 
(keep in mind I am sticking to affordable stocks where gains could actually make a significant profit with a decent change in price)

* AMD - Very obvious leader in graphics cards next to their competitor NVDA (which is just too expensive to buy alot of)

* VUZI - To me I feel like they are going to be a top contender next to the big names for AR related to the healthcare industry.

* MSFT - Obvious but not sure how much this stock price will move long term.

* Considering FB and SONY because They currently have what I'd say is the most powerful VR advantage, even though they are expensive-ish.

* Really looking for stocks like WorldViz which isn't publicly traded. Companies involved in the virtual worlds development and education sectors development of VR/AR is going to be everything in the future. Every home will be involved and participating, just like the internet is used now.


I hope I didn't forget things I wanted to say."

13,2017-05-29,GumbaOi,10,VR Plays?,"A bit about me: I've got a degree in computer engineering, work in software consulting, and have always been an admirer of technology.  

For the past few years I've been incredibly interested in the prospect of VR. Last year I purchased an HTC Vive. I had no idea what to expect, but I was completed blown away. First of all, the tech was MUCH MUCH better than I expected, but also I was inspired by the future prospects. I still believe VR to be an under appreciated and less known space, considering the tech is already more advanced than the general public knows.  

I believe there can be incredible advancements in hardware and software including education, entertainment, development, business.  

So my question... Has anyone done in work investing in the VR space? Where are you guys looking? Obviously the major players are Facebook, Microsoft, and Sony... but has anyone looked deeper? Smaller software comopanies? Screen makers?"
14,2017-05-29,MartEden,0,How Microsoft Is Pursuing the Lane between VR and AR,"Mixed reality coming to challenge virtual reality
Microsoft (MSFT) has mostly kept its AR (augmented reality) headset, HoloLens, as a developer product. However, the tech giant is starting to reach out to the masses with a technology that delivers the HoloLens experience and more. However, its moves could rattle Facebook and Sony, who are trying to dominate the VR (virtual reality) market.

Microsoft is taking the MR (mixed reality) experience to the masses. MR sits somewhere between AR and VR in that it cuts you off from the physical world but allows you to interact with digital items like software."

2) IoT--&gt; increased in home internet

I'd like to invest in the data/internet infrastructure.

ATT looks like a good bet with mobile data &amp; fiber connections laid down for home internet

In terms of a longterm play is ATT my best option?

Does ATT actually own the cell towers or do they lease from Cell Tower REITs?

16,2017-06-07,hfutrell,1,thoughts on recent AR/VR Apple announcements?,"1. Apple is now selling a VR development kit through their developer program. The $599 platform consists of a Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) external GPU chasis, a AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU, and a $100 discount to purchase an HTC Vive VR headset.

2. MacOS High Sierra will support external GPUs, potentially making all current Macs VR capable at minimal cost. Nvidia has already released beta drivers for their GPUs that unlock this use case, and as I mentioned the development kit uses an AMD GPU.

3. Steam VR is coming to Mac

4. Apple has announced ARKit for iOS, an augmented reality framework to simplify development of augmented reality apps.

5. Apple has announced VisionKit for iOS, a computer vision framework that uses machine learning on-device. In developer sessions they demonstrated an augmented reality app that could label the dominant element in a scene in real time (""you're looking at a banana"", ""now you're looking at a microwave"", etc)

6. Apple has announced an update to its 3D graphics API, Metal, to support VR and external GPUs.

So what do we make of this? In particular I'm interested in the ramifications of external GPUs. Does the fact that Mac users will not need to buy a new machine to support VR make them a wider market than PCs? I am a Mac / iOS expert and professional developer, but I am not an expert on PCs or VR, so I'm interested in people's thoughts."

19,2017-08-18,alpha_u9df9H,0,We are looking for 1-2 people for our accountability group,"Hope this is ok to post in this group..as I thought this could help some like minded entrepreneur here..


I am part of a small accountability/mastermind group focused on entrepreneurship and self-improvement (pure volunteer basis). We are looking for 1-2 people who are dreamers, but can take the small steps necessary to get to their individual goals. 


The group meets on the 2nd and 4th Sunday of each month over google hangouts from ~ 7:45pm – 9 pm EST (mandatory). We also meet 1-on-1 on alternate weekends informally (optional), to get to know and check in with each other. 


To give an idea of the group:
One of the members is a CEO of a VR and Ethereum startup. He won the competition at one of the biggest startup launch conferences in SF. Going for multimillion$ ICO, was a regional sales manager for one of the big telecom companies. 
A second person is a COO and 20 year veteran of a legal startup, leading a group of 20 lawyers. He has developed a number of habits (coldshowers/meditation/GTD/journaling) and is working on starting a tech startup.
Me: 1. Finished my phd from a top 3 US university in my field 2. Fixed my sleep schedule (go to sleep at 8:30 wake at 3:30 ish am), 3. Meditate everyday 4. Follow a strict IF diet 5. went from being extremely introverted to a point, where my circle consists of a few CEOs and heavy hitters 6. Starting a business in SV 7. Dropped 50 lbs 


We have ~3-4 members from all over US, who attend regularly and have 1-2 open positions. I think the best accountability/mastermind relationship happens when you know and trust the other person, as a result regular voice/video chat is necessary. We have 3 hot-seat meetings (where members get time to talk in detail about their long term plans and get feedback) and jointly discuss 1 book on business/self-development on the 4th meeting, every 2 months.


We have a 75% attendance requirement (over 2 months), and an organized structure for efficiently conducting the meetings.


Please fill out this form, if you are interested. We will get back to you by the end of this month: https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=fLNjQzxf10-lYZQxMdt4vIC3uQN3FzpDrq1951989lNUQzRaTTlSMEVEMVJJMlZJUVNJVUdTT0U2Sy4u

24,2017-10-30,anticontenttime,2,Apple: What fingers in what pies?,"Quick clarification: I can picture an insane growth potential for Google over the next 10 years as they're invested in AI, Autonomous Cars, Space shenanigans, VR, Smartphones, etc.

What would be Apple's equivalent projects in terms of potential growth? I'm not really sure what they're up to apart from more iPhones, Macs and the obligatory VR."
25,2017-10-21,anticontenttime,7,Good VR Related Investments?,"If we're betting that VR is bound to become increasingly integrated into our daily lives and experiences, it would seem ridiculous not to try and get in on it, no?

If I could, I'd invest a-lot in Valve for example, but as we know they show no signs of going public.

Apart from the obvious giants like Google and Facebook, what other interesting ways could there be to cash in on this, or ""bet on this horse""? I'm wary of Samsung and HTC for example, as they have a-lot that could go wrong for them in the phone business that could negatively affect their stock, so I guess I'm looking more in the direction of exclusively VR companies, with a high potential to be indispensable in the long run.

Any thoughts and ideas?"
26,2017-10-06,AuthoritarianBear,2,Thoughts about VR?,"I'm thinking HTC, Oculus. Do you think they'll continue to grow? "
27,2017-12-27,-penci,8,Investing in the future of VR,"Im confident that 2018 will be the year of VR. Although I fully understand some of the fundament drawbacks and limitations of the VR space at the minute, I'm confident in the area but would like to develop my understanding better before jumping in.

Does anyone here have VR related holdings and is anyone here able to throw a few VR related stocks at me.. from those that actually develop the content (Activision,etc) to those that create the headsets (Sony, etc) through to the chipmakers (NVIDIA, etc) want to have a broad range of stocks to look at before jumping in and would appreciate all contribution.

To take this thread further, once a few stocks have been thrown in the mixer we can get discussing and hopefully create a dynamic conversation about the market and how it develops throughout the year
