""First, and most disturbing to me, there are ICOs where the lawyers involved appear to be, on the one hand, assisting promoters in structuring offerings of products that have many of the key features of a securities offering, but call it an ""ICO,"" which sounds pretty close to an ""IPO.""  On the other hand, those lawyers claim the products are not securities, and the promoters proceed without compliance with the securities laws, which deprives investors of the substantive and procedural investor protection requirements of our securities laws.""

""...I have instructed the SEC staff to be on high alert for approaches to ICOs that may be contrary to the spirit of our securities laws and the professional obligations of the U.S. securities bar.""

""The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalize on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the securities laws, particularly in the case of an offering.""

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre off to an outstanding start in 2018, with powerful momentum and financial strength continuing across all core metrics. Our enhanced competitive position and increased scale, thanks to our recent acquisition of Scottrade, is further accelerating our earnings power, which we expect to continue following the final clearing conversion,‚Äù said Tim Hockey, TD Ameritrade president and chief executive officer. ‚ÄúTrading was at record levels, and investor engagement has continued across all client segments as the market reached new highs. **Enhanced consumer interest in blockchain and cannabis-related securities drove a further surge in engagement in the final weeks of the quarter, *particularly among first-time investors*.** New account growth is at record levels, interest in our digital guidance solutions remains high, and use of our multiple mobile offerings continues to rise. Our fully-staffed service centers are busy, providing education to clients and arming them with the information they need to make informed investment decisions.‚Äù

Just an FYI. I'm not going to say that this is a top by any means, but TD Ameritrade specifically saying that ""first time investors are piling into weed stocks and blockchain stocks"" isn't something you hear at bottoms, either.

10,2018-01-19,eduardonachocamacho,0,Question on if I'm understanding cryptocurrency correctly after self education.,"I chose to dive into the history and use of Bitcoin mainly, because it seems to be the most consistently popular transaction method within the crypto world. Having done so I came away with my own conclusions, and perhaps they're obvious but given that the system is ""new"" (relatively speaking in terms of popularity), I wanted to share and also see if my assumptions are correct or not. 

So the creation of the currencies themselves strike me as the strangest part of the whole system, specifically the creation of Bitcoin itself. It has the original created blockchain itself, but then the subsequent uses of the forking method seem to be almost illimitable, in theory. With each fork not only affecting the value of the currency itself but also the method by which that value is derived (as for as I understand it, mainly through the various mining techniques which are added or subtracted in each of these forking events). 

Bitcoin was also created with a circulatory limit in mind, which I also found interesting. At which point this circulation limit is reached, then the value of the currency is dictated purely by the transactions which occur, which is not the case now. As far as investing goes, this seems to be the only place which could, theoretically, be reached where market speculation is even fundamentally feasible. Am I wrong in this thinking? (this is also a far away limit, mind you. I don't have the exact figure at hand)

It also appears the market is ripe for manipulation with mining techniques - another way of obtaining currency within the system - available in ways which lack much firm regulation. 

Basically I came away fairly dubious on the whole market be sustainable at all, at least as to how it relates to our current base currency (I don't even want to get into foreign markets). But I'd be happy to be proven wrong, because I may be and suspect I'm missing something.

&gt;5 CONCLUSION
The Bitcoin creators‚Äô intention was to develop a decentralized cash-like electronic payment
system. In this process, they faced the fundamental challenge of how to establish and transfer digital property rights of a monetary unit without a central authority. They solved this challenge
by inventing the Bitcoin Blockchain. This novel technology allows us to store and transfer a
monetary unit without the need for a central authority, similar to cash.
Price volatility and scaling issues frequently raise concerns about the suitability of Bitcoin
as a payment instrument. As an asset, however, Bitcoin and alternative blockchain-based
tokens should not be neglected. **The innovation makes it possible to represent digital property
without the need for a central authority. This can lead to the creation of a new asset class that
can mature into a valuable portfolio diversification instrument. Moreover, blockchain technology
provides an infrastructure that enables numerous applications. Promising applications
include using colored coins, smart contracts, and the possibility of using fingerprints to secure
the integrity of data files in a blockchain, which may bring change to the world of finance
and to many other sectors.**

I also like this think piece by the NYT: 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html

&gt;Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical ‚Äî almost communitarian ‚Äî possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don‚Äôt have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.

&gt;**Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain.** Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can‚Äôt change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.

13,2018-01-17,mdcd4u2c,36,"Since this gets asked fairly often, I put together a list of podcasts I listen(ed) to, with descriptions and links.","This questions gets asked on /r/investing and /r/stocks fairly often, so I wrote up a little list for new subscribers who might be interested. I tried describing each one in my own words but it's obviously subjective, so I also chose an episode that really stuck out as one that I remembered listening to, if there was one. Let me know if there's any you want to add to the list. Hope this helps!

FWIW, I like investing from a macro theme, so I probably have a bias towards podcasts that have a lot of macro, but I try to keep an open mind and keep other podcasts on my list as long as I can learn from them. I don't have patience for interviewers that talk more than their guests or try to sell stuff like their books constantly. I also don't really keep a lot of podcasts on my list that are too beginner level because I find myself getting bored, but depending on where you are in your learning, they can definitely be helpful!

The hosts have a bearish view on the US economy and so do a lot of their guests, but they do an okay job of bringing on an opposing view as well. Their focus is more macro-themed, but since they're bringing on a lot of different guests, you will have some that run their money in terms of value or momentum or a million other things. Overall good variance if you don't really know which school of though you follow yet.|

I'm not an avid listener but I've listened to 20-30 episodes (they have hundreds).

Verizon has pulled Bloomberg TV from its offerings for 4.6 million subscribers, after being asked to pay for the content. VZ's argument is that Bloomberg is making the content available to all consumers for free via web and mobile app, and that it shouldn't have to pay carriage fees.


**VW IS STILL THE BEST**

Volkswagen group sales rose to around 10.7 million cars last year, keeping the German behemoth ahead of its Japanese competition as the world's largest automaker. The report came as Ron Stach, senior vice president of sales at Volkswagen of America, left the company. U.S. sales rose 5.2% to 339,676 brand models last year but dropped 19% in December as the carmaker shifted focus to its homeland.

Talks and exhibitions will be on artificial intelligence, augmented reality, 4K TVs, robots and new drones, and these are just part of the buzz.

**FX WORLD**

Friday‚Äôs NFP has missed big time and our pairs reacted accordingly, or in cases not so subsequently. We are going to have an interesting week, with FED rate hike clues.

The **EURUSD** had a nice run on the NFP report but pulled back to 1.20, which seems to be the support at this point. The pair is still ‚Äúfighting‚Äù 1.21 as it froze the market a bit, if we break it, 1.23 or even 1.25 is doable.

The **GBPUSD** also rallied and turned to the downside. Above 1.365 would mean that we closed a massive gap below and could offer a buy and hold market. Until then just buy the dips, as 1.3333 is the floor.

The **USDJPY** has bounced on Friday, which is interesting since the jobs report numbers missed significantly. This shows that the market is interested to go 115 and beyond. Until we break above, use the dips for entries.

27,2018-01-05,khonsu01,0,"Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Tech Market Could Reach $10 Trillion in 15 Years, Says RBC Analyst","In a report published on January 3, 2018, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves confidently stated that the cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology applications market could increase thirteenfold in 15 years, reaching $10 trillion.

Steves‚Äô report, titled ‚ÄúCrypto Currency &amp; Blockchain Technology: A Decentralized Future ‚Äî A Potential Multi-Trillion Dollar Opportunity,‚Äù has been sent to RBC‚Äôs clients. A short summary has been shared on Twitter.

In a video published by CNBC, Steves, who often covers high technology stocks including Nvidia, whose value has been boosted by cryptocurrency mining, defends his bullish expectations on blockchain technology and its applications. According to Steves, cryptocurrencies represent only a part of the $10 trillion pie, the bulk of which is in the rest of the ecosystem existing around blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

‚ÄúI think what people misunderstand about the cryptocurrency space is that it‚Äôs not only a store of value, but it also allows you to secure the internet,‚Äù says Steves. Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies will permit creating decentralized versions of value storage services like Dropbox or iCloud. The $10 trillion figure represents one third of the current size of the market for value storage.

Steves argues that blockchain technology will permit creating a ‚ÄúSecure World Computer,‚Äù a decentralized world computer without a third-party intermediary, intrinsically more secure because there won‚Äôt be centralized servers that can be hacked, and suggests that next-generation killer apps will be built on top of this secure layer.

The smart move for investors, according to Steves, is to get involved with cryptocurrencies directly. As far as traditional stocks are concerned, Steves mentions public companies like AMS and Nvidia, whose chips power cryptocurrency mining hardware, and the private companies that make ASIC chips for bitcoin mining. At the same time, Steves warns that cloud service providers are likely to be the most impacted from blockchain technology, with negative results if they don‚Äôt manage to adapt.

According to Steves, the value of the blockchain technology market is also growing due to international remittances ‚Äî the sending of payments overseas is currently estimated at half a trillion dollars per year ‚Äî ‚Äúfat protocol‚Äù layers that increase in value as the applications grow, and throughput scaling efforts, such as the Lightning Network, which ‚Äúappear on track to deliver scaling that accommodates higher transactions/second, ultimately driving higher utility and network value.‚Äù

While warning that the cryptocurrency space has many risks, Steves argues that the opportunity appears vast, with constant technology updates, and a multi-trillion dollar market will likely emerge.

In a recent, related article published by the RBC, Fr√©d√©rique Carrier, managing director and head of investment strategy for RBC Wealth Management in the British Isles, argued that, while cryptocurrencies are unlikely to replace traditional money, blockchain technology could have wide-ranging implications in many industries and for investors in the medium-to-long term.

The potential of blockchain technology ‚Äúmakes it a technology well worth watching closely, which we intend to do,‚Äù notes Carrier, adding that RBC is experimenting with blockchain technology in its personal, commercial and capital markets businesses. RBC recently announced the implementation of a blockchain-based shadow ledger for cross-border payments between the U.S. and Canada.

29,2018-01-02,Siliconjurer,17,CFO/Sec'y of RIOT Blockchain previously sued twice over pump-and-dump biotech company,"The CFO and Secretary of Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) is Jeffrey G. McGonegal
See here: https://www.riotblockchain.com/about/management-team

The first pump-and-dump incident was under the name AspenBio:
https://www.denverpost.com/2011/01/14/aspenbio-battling-investors-lawsuits/

CFO of AspenBio, Jeffrey McGonegal, was awarded a bit under $290k in stock options in just 2009 off of that pump and dump scheme (probably a lot more over the years of the now-defunct company's existence). 

Investors sued in 2011 (see: http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1045/APPY10_01/2011823_r01c_11CV00165.pdf). Jeffrey G. McGonegal is personally named in the lawsuit.

After years of delay, a judge dismissed the lawsuit, despite misleading statements being made by AspenBio executives, and countless smaller investors losing money. The case was also dismissed despite AspenBio's management team personally profiting heavily due to these poorly informed investments.

Then again, in 2015, after AspenBio was renamed to Venaxis, just 2 defendants were individually named in another lawsuit involving the then re-branded firm:
http://securities.stanford.edu/filings-documents/1053/VI00_01/201522_f01c_15CV00222.pdf

The two individually named defendants were Stephen Lundy and Jeffrey McGonegal. This lawsuit was over a separate pump-and-dump scandal involving Venaxis, and its shares falling from $2.04 to $0.55 on January 29th due to damaging information.

The complaint states: ""Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the APPY1 510(k) submission and the Company‚Äôs future prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the APPY1 test failed to meet the criteria for ‚Äúsubstantial equivalence‚Äù based upon data and information submitted by Venaxis in its 510(k) submission; (2) the Company lacked a reasonable basis to conclude that the results from the APPY1 pivotal study were sufficient to support FDA clearance; and as a result of the foregoing, (3) Venaxis‚Äô public statements pertaining to the expected FDA clearance of its 510(k) submission were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.""

This is what comes up from a very quick, cursory Google search. Who knows how much more information would surface with more thorough background checks on Riot Blockchain's management team."

32,2018-02-17,financeadvicethrwawy,60,I have 100k all in one US stock. How should I diversify this to ensure a financially stable future?,"Hello everybody! Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll start with some background information:

I am 21 years old and in my fourth year of university. I study international business. When I was born, my grandfather invested in a US stock (biopharma) for me that split many times and ended up as a large sum of cash. It has paid for my college thus far and will leave me in the green after graduation. I have no debt. With only one semester left, I'll probably have somewhere near $90k when I graduate. I also have about $10k in cryptocurrency. My stock pays about a 3% dividend. I have no credit. I am also a dual citizen of USA and Switzerland with the opportunity to invest easily in international markets.

However, as I am currently an unemployed student, I depend on these funds for my daily living expenses such as rent, insurance, and food. At this rate, without any income, these funds will all be gone within a few more years of living off of them. Considering how high the market is, I'm a bit worried about a market crash/correction, especially because all of my eggs are in one basket. This leads to my questions for y'all.

How should I diversify these funds so that they continue to grow and prosper throughout my life? What actions should I take to set up a successful financial future with my current financial position? What would be the best way to utilize these funds in creating passive income streams?

I've been researching other stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds, but have been unable to come to a consensus on my own. Some specific options I've looked into are ARKW, AMZN, GOOG, TSLA, FB, QQQ, and NVDA, as well as other forms of investment such as real estate and gold. I'm very interested in industries such as tech, renewable energy, marijuana, blockchain, and finance.

I know you all are finance gurus, and I could really use your help in planning for a secure, successful financial future. Any guidance and advice is much appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!"

Shares in the Paris-based company have soared more than 60 percent since it gave further details of its crypto push on Feb. 8, after first mentioning some of the plans in December. Atari is taking a stake in a company that‚Äôs building a blockchain-based digital entertainment platform and, as part of that agreement, it will create its own digital currency called Atari Token. The company is also expanding its online casino-gaming partnership with Pariplay Ltd. to allow gambling with digital currencies.

‚ÄúBlockchain technology is poised to take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize, the current economic ecosystem, especially in the areas of the video game industry and online transactions,‚Äù Atari Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederic Chesnais said in the statement. ‚ÄúOur aim is to take strategic positions with a limited cash risk, in order to best create value with the assets and the Atari brand.‚Äù

Atari isn‚Äôt the only stock that has benefited from links with cryptocurrencies. Shares of Eastman Kodak Co. jumped 245 percent in two days after it said last month it‚Äôs working with a company that promotes paparazzi photos to offer a blockchain-based service for paying photographers. And, in perhaps the most bizarre of such moves, the unprofitable iced-tea company formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Corp. gained 183 percent in a day after re-branding as Long Blockchain Corp. in December.

37,2018-02-10,Hassan_Gym,0,Why is there such animosity towards Cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology?,[removed]
38,2018-02-10,DogfaceDino,12,"Kerrisdale Capital publishes blistering report on Kodak and KODAKCoin, their crypto currency and media rights licensing solution","From the introduction:

&gt; We are short shares of Eastman Kodak Company (‚ÄúKodak‚Äù, NYSE: KODK), a 138-year old commercial printing and imaging company whose stock has more than doubled since announcing a blockchain and cryptocurrency licensing partnership.

&gt;Fittingly for a long-time provider of motion picture film products, Kodak‚Äôs sudden rise resembles something out of the movies. A dying relic of American manufacturing licenses its brand to a blockchain project and immediately creates over $300m of value. Along the way Kodak board members conveniently grant themselves shares the day before the announcement, a stock promoter with a checkered past is engaged for PR, and a group of German copyright trolls reinvent themselves as blockchain-enabled image platform managers.

&gt;Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are exciting technologies with the potential to disrupt many industries; their use in media rights licensing by KODAKOne will not be one of them. The use of blockchain in operating an image copyright platform accomplishes nothing. KODAKOne intends to utilize smart contracts and a crypto-asset to solve the problem of copyright infringement, but the business idea is flat-out silly. Cryptographically hashing an image into a blockchain doesn‚Äôt prove the provenance of intellectual property, a blockchain does not reduce the resources necessary for copyright enforcement, no photographer would rather be paid in KODAKCoins over real money, etc. KODAKOne is little more than a moribund company‚Äôs hollow attempt to chase the ICO craze. It‚Äôs a PR stunt ‚Äì a distraction that will pass when the company reports earnings and reminds investors of its distressed financial position.

&gt;Unsurprisingly for such a nonsensical business concept, the team behind KODAKCoin has zero credibility. The chairman and founder of a key firm behind the ICO is a stock promoter who was previously banned from a Canadian stock exchange. KODAKOne‚Äôs executive team is unknown within the blockchain developer community. KODAKCoin is not a serious attempt to apply new technology to a real problem ‚Äì it‚Äôs a last-ditch stock promotion gambit for a company hurtling towards bankruptcy.

&gt;Kodak faces significant debt maturities, tightening liquidity, and restrictive debt covenants while financials are in free fall. The company is a sub-scale player in a highly competitive, secularly declining industry. Management has repeatedly failed to stem negative free cash flow and botched long promised asset sales. The situation is grim and these same set of circumstances bankrupted the company 6 years ago. Kodak doesn‚Äôt have the luxury of hoping startup blockchain projects succeed ‚Äì it‚Äôs staring at the possibility of default and a debt restructuring in the next 12-18 months. Potential ICO proceeds and royalty payments from KODAKOne do not change the high probability of these events. Rather than dreaming of a ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù for photographers, shareholders should be concerned about an eventual wipe-out. We¬†view the equity as worthless, implying downside of -100%.

39,2018-02-08,PowerDubs,2,"1+1+1=$$$? Lets discuss Atari who is emerging involvement with gaming, gambling, blockchain crypto, AMD...","I own stock in Atari, therefore I try to follow their projects.

They have offices in the U.S. but are based out of France, so most of the chatter online I have to run through Google translate.

I have noticed a trend in their projects which ties together nicely- speculative at this point yes, but the entire market is speculative really (invest in a company hoping they will profit, grow, expand, etc).

So here is what I have so far- lets discuss possibilities.

#1- Atari is already involved in real money gambling, both online and in casinos.  One of their partners is Pariplay.  Reference- http://www.pariplayltd.com/legend-lives-pariplay-atari-launch-atari-pong-online-slot/  ""Pong is the latest video arcade classic from Atari¬Æ to be honoured with an action-packed online slot, featuring non-stop excitement and plenty of big win potential. Pariplay‚Äôs previous Atari¬Æ-branded releases include Asteroids¬Æ, Star Raiders¬Æ and Black Widow¬Æ.""

#2- Pariplay just signed a deal with Foxwoods casino.  Reference- https://www.reviewed-casinos.com/news/pariplay-foxwoods-igaming-platform-tie/  ""Gaming tech firm Pariplay has partnered Foxwoods Resort Casino in what it considers a landmark technology agreement.
... enabling guests at North America's largest resort casino to enjoy digital gaming on-property

... provide guests access to a myriad of digital games, including branded titles Atari Pong, X-O Manowar and Atari Asteroids via a Foxwoods-branded mobile application and web portal.



#3- Atari just released this- (again google translated)

""Paris, France - February 8, 2018. The Atari Group announces two major development projects in the field of blockchains and crypto-currencies, with a shareholding in a crypto-platform and the creation of a dedicated Token (""Atari Token""), and on the other hand the upcoming launch of casino platforms offering crypto-currency game options.

Acquisition of a stake in Infinity Networks Ltd (Gibraltar) and creation of Atari Token
Atari took a 15% stake, with a 17.5% stake in Infinity Networks, Ltd. (Gibraltar). This investment, made without cash disbursement by Atari, demonstrates the appeal of the Atari brand. Infinity Networks, Ltd. (Gibraltar), a company founded by a team of veteran Entertainment and Finance industry veterans and led by Ron Dimant and Daniel Doll-Steinberg, has an advisory board that brings together leading figures from foreground in the field of blockchains. The company is developing a decentralized platform giving access to any form of digital entertainment, ie a very wide offer ranging from video games to movies and music. This platform, under development, will work using cryptocurrency, the Atari Token. In exchange for these equity interests, earnings and future royalties, Atari has granted Infinity Networks, Ltd. (Gibraltar) a long-term license to use the Atari brand.

""Blockchains technology is poised to take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize, the current economic ecosystem, especially in the areas of the video game industry and online transactions,"" he said. Fr√©d√©ric Chesnais, CEO of Atari, SA. ""Given our technological strengths with the development studios, and the global reputation of the Atari brand, we have the opportunity to position ourselves attractively in this sector. Our objective is to take strategic positions with a limited cash risk, in order to optimize the assets and the Atari brand "".

The second project in progress is the strengthening of the partnership with Pariplay, Ltd in the launch in 2018 of casino platforms allowing players to bet either in real money or with most crypto-currencies currently outstanding. . These casino sites will offer many Atari games. To broaden the appeal of these new casinos, and once the Atari Token available, Atari has the project to launch Pong Token, a second Token dedicated to crypto-casinos and usable on these gaming sites. The details of this launch of crypto-casinos will be announced soon.



#4- Chairman and CEO of Atari is 'advisor' to Virt-U

#5-  We all know the widespread knowledge that Atari &amp; AMD are partnered on the upcoming Atari home gaming console- confirmed by AMD to be using a Ryzen chip.

SOO...again this is all speculation by me, but this console *could* not only be used for normal games, but possibly be involved with the Atari token both in transactions, gaming, mining, and even gambling.

Lots to chew on.  Lots that would need to fall into place.  Lots of chances of failures.  But if it all ties together like it appears it could do...they just may be consolidating what at initial glance would be diversified projects.

3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR‚Äôs requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies ‚Äì those with greater than $500 million in revenues ‚Äì say they will hire a consulting firm.

4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe‚Äôs New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley‚Äôs tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

‚ÄúEvery person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,‚Äù said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. ‚ÄúG.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.‚Äù 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR ‚Äì new rules, wider reach ‚Äì the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the ‚Äúmost ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era‚Äù ‚Äì and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

53,2018-03-05,jesrabbitt,0,How do you get exposure to blockchain when publicly-traded companies solely focused on developing the tech don't exist yet?,"Everyone is caught up with the cryptocurrency 'gold rush', but I haven't seen many discussions about the more *long-term* (an and in my opinion, more exciting) investment opportunities in blockchain technology. We know it's set to drastically disrupt industries like banking and energy in the next 5-10 years, but many of the companies currently developing these innovations are start-ups or small private companies. 

How does the average investor (not a finance professional or HNI individual) get exposure to this space when publicly-traded companies solely focused on blockchain don't exist yet? Am I limited to big blue chips like IBM, Microsoft and Barclays who are integrating and funding the technology, and ETFs made up the same companies (but selling at a premium)? Or are there other less-obvious opportunities out there? "

Paypie is launching its beta April 30th just one day before Populous.

Paypie is a decentralized accounting platform that has a credit risk algorithm. The accounting of a business is scanned and the businesses is given a credit risk score that can be purchased with PPP tokens. The populous platform also allows for peer to peer invoice financing with the added value of this credit score. .

PayPie has the potential to become the Moody's of the blockchain. However PayPie is not a huge threat to Populous because its major focus is the credit score, and Populous is solely focusing on invoice lending, so there is room for both of them in the space."

60,2018-04-12,numizmat,0,PayPie risk algorithm improves lending by providing historical transactional and financial data along with credit rating powered by blockchain,"**Problem:** Isolation of financial data leads to fraud, duplicated tasks, expensive audits and skyrocketing lending costs creating
cash flow problems for businesses.

**Solution:** With PayPie, instead of keeping separate records in different accounting
software, companies can write their transactions directly into
a joint register on blockchain, thus creating an interlocking
system of ensuring accounting records. This ‚ÄúSingle Ledger‚Äù
will enable live financial audits, end duplicate tasks, speed up
credit approvals, fight fraud, and improve the overall credit
scoring process for SMEs by disrupting business accounting
landscape.

**Better access to the capital:** SMEs get immediate access to liquidity by selling their invoices to the PayPie platform

**Invoice financing marketplace:** Open the door for individuals, lenders, investors, invoice factoring companies, banks, or other
financial institutions to provide liquidity to SMEs. Build better Decentralized Trust and Transparency Rating (DTTR) for future.

PayPie was born from the fact that auditors, regulators, lenders, investors, banks and other financial institutions lack real time
financial insights of a business, and their decisions are based on the historical data that may be six months to a year old and those
numbers do not reveal enough quality data coming from isolated &amp; disconnected systems to obtain an accurate appraisal of the
company‚Äôs financial health.

63,2018-04-05,chalinaa456,0,For those of you into cryptocurrencies... (powh.io),"I stumbled upon a website which gives you side income indefinately. You basically invest ETH in it and it transfers it into ""tokens"", which basically work like stocks for the site, so the more tokens you have, the more eth you will earn. 

This site works by subtracting 10% of the amount you put in once you buy in, and that 10% is shared between all of the shareholders in the contract. Another 10% is shared once you sell, so both buying and selling earn you ""Dividends"". 

These dividends also add to the price increase of the token itself, so you earn even more money, and as we are still pretty early, we will earn more in the future.

This platform is a smart contract built in the Ethereum blockchain, and it has got no human interaction, so it¬¥s ""trustless"". This contract also has no backdoors so an exit scam isn¬¥t possible. Its also important to mention that its practically unhackable as it has succesfully passed through 2 Hackathlons.

They are claiming to have 90,000 account information. Yet they managed to pull funds out of peoples account. The criminals are asking for I think the articles mentioned a $1 million ransom in XRP (ripple cryptocurrency). 

Why would they ask for a $1 million ransom if they already proved the capability to pull funds out of the vistims accounts. Also why do they want the ransom paid in ripple? The banks said that they won't give in to the demands of the criminals. Yet Ripple is the most bank friendly blockchain/cryptocurrency and the most easy cryptocurrency to trace. Here is another thing, BMO is partners with Ripple, so they can make this happen in there favor.

67,2018-05-29,Smart-City,0,Crypto-Virgin talks about ICO market (Analysis &amp; Advise),"### Story to Think

Business man, untouched by ‚Äúcrypto‚Äùcomments ICO investment market.

### I know what I am talking About

I have implemented many mid\-size projects \(up to $8M budget/year\). All of them for international enterprise type of business. I am aware of the development and implementation costs of CRM, ERP or GL. I also know a usual effort &amp; costs for smaller desktop/mobile systems development.

### ICO Analysis

One of my activity is building a Sales Performance Network. A year ago we decided to use Blockchain for data lock feature in our platform. I have started to analyse Blockchains projects, that routed me to ICO. It was interesting area for me, so I came with the idea to make part of the project funding by ICO.

### Deep Analysis of ¬†that Crypto Sh*t

I have deep analysed 100\+ middle succeed projects and passed through 500\+. During analysis I watch to an idea, architecture, development, operations and profitability. I was mainly focused to the financial information, if any. Can you imagine that 99&amp;#37; of project don‚Äôt have even basic business case? Just a promises and marketing.

### Business not Found

I have seen ideas and ideology, sometimes some techie parts. I haven‚Äôt seen the Money.¬†The most of ICOs don‚Äôt have even a basic forecasts justification! They even mix the budget distribution with the tokens distribution, that‚Äôs a total non\-sense! What a hell? Project without numbers? Who the fu\*k are those investors who gave them money? Teenagers?

### Real vs. Crypto

**Case 1 ‚Äì End\-User oriented software/service Mobile Application ‚Äì**¬†How many of ‚Äúmobile app projects‚Äù have you seen in trackers? I think that many. And successfully funded. For example in reality ‚Äì it costs up to $2,4M to implement an enterprise mobile application and develop infrastructure. If you make it by in\-house development, it will cost you $1,1M and lot of time.¬†When I watch to an ICOs and I see funding $15M, I am asking myself. Are the crypto investors thinking before buying?

**Case 2 ‚Äì Token as a Utility** ‚Äì In my understanding, this is¬†a common Countertrade principle. Value for Value. On ICO the value of token = value of product. The problem is, that till the product release, the token‚Äôs real business value is zero! In the most cases of projects, the token is powered by marketing that creates the value of hope, the rest are manipulations and speculations. And they get¬†$20M funding for this hope of good idea. But where is the product value? Where is the sales plan? Where is market analysis? I mean, analysis, not that 7 rows of exponential growth. Investors ‚Äì do you Calculate and Think before you Pay?!

### How ICOs get Money?

Mess of chaotic information streams. These streams are supported by thick and manipulative ICO trackers\*. These trackers and ICOs itself are supported by a millions of communication Bots that serves a mass information to huge amount of ‚Äúbusiness incompetent‚Äù crypto holders who have no idea how the profit model should looks like. These people supports all that amateur shit, just because ‚Äúthey trust an Idea‚Äù! Can you imagine, that you give any money in similar conditions in real life? 

### Hyperbolised Crypto Value

Imagine that there exists thousands of crypto currencies and tokens. The blockchain¬†development¬†mainstream is powered by ideology. The rest is powered by a bubble of trust of a green investors, manipulated by experienced speculation groups. All this hyperbolised by¬†non\-regulated exchanges that blow up it to an enormous power of worthless digital ‚Äúthings‚Äù.

### Galaxy of¬†ICOs

ICO is a Galaxy of these crypto ‚Äúthings‚Äù. People pay extreme money for nothing, motivates fraud and scam that vomit another shit to the chaos and naturally impacts the cost of services paid by ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù. How much?

68,2018-05-23,treatmesubj,0,"Doesn't the dollar have value because there is a central authority who can produce it, unlike bitcoin?","There's no intrinsic value of a U.S. dollar. We don't even have a gold standard anymore. People only accept dollars because they are confident that others will too, right? The pieces of paper only have value because everybody thinks they have value. However, I understand that a widely accepted medium of exchange enormously increases our level of productivity. 
In Free to Choose by Milton Friedman I've read that continuing inflation does not naturally occur in capitalism. Inflation occurs because the central authority (the government) increases the quantity of the money supply rapidly with the ""printing press.""
This made me think about bitcoin. There is no central authority of bitcoin. No one can simply ""print"" bitcoin, the coin must be mined in blockchain. Bitcoin essentially solves inflation then, right? I also understand it addresses lots of other issues with currencies. It seems like a pretty darn good currency even though it also has no intrinsic value too.
So why does the dollar or other currencies still have value? Obviously, people have a lot of trust in government. But, isn't the fundamental reason the dollar has value is because there is a central authority who can produce it?
Logically, people mine bitcoin because the number of coins is certain and they'd like to have a larger portion of the coins because as the number of available coins to be mined decreases, the value of their mined coins increases. But, what's the point? Why would bitcoin ultimately become a currency?
Why would any currency with no intrinsic value logically become a widely accepted currency?
I feel like the increased productivity of a widely accepted medium of exchange is simply a consequence of the real answer. I guess some people would just simply trust the government.
Isn't the reason the dollar has value is because the government ""prints"" it?"

72,2018-05-18,NikolaosKost,4,China Issued Cryptocurrency Rating Index: Ethereum First,"On May 17, the first monthly cryptocurrency rating index that evaluates 28 virtual currencies and Blockchains was launched by the CCID. The index has been developed based on three criteria: technology, application, and innovation.

Ethereum scores were very high in all three categories: 80.3 in technology, 23.7 in applicability and 25.4 in creativity. The total score obtained by Ethereum was 129.4 points. In the second\-place comes Steem with 115.9 points and then Lisk scoring 104.89 points.

Bitcoin coin ranks 13th scoring 88.1 points, the same as Verge.

The Twitter account cnLedger uploaded a table that shows the ranking cited by ethereumworldnews.com:

During the last year, China took several measures to con troll cryptocurrencies and banned Initial Coin Offerings \(ICOs\). Virtual currency trading activities are also banned.

Notably, China‚Äôs intention to create a national cryptocurrency was a pioneer. Russia, Venezuela, and Iran followed the same way.

The underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, Blockchain, can be applied to many other industries like finance, healthcare, supply chain, and others. And it is known that China is one of the leading countries regarding Blockchain tech.

In 2017, according to Reuters, China registered more than half of the world‚Äôs Blockchain related patent applications. This trend seems to be continued in 2018. That is the obvious reason behind the government‚Äôs intention to understand how cryptocurrencies work, how they are being developed and what they have to offer.

Ethereum has been selected as the network with the second\-highest score in technology, the best score in the application and a very good score in innovation. Notably, the market capitalization of the coin is unrelated to the index. Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash do not have a good ranking. They were 21st, 17th, and 25th respectively. EOS is not present in the report.

74,2018-05-16,Derivatives99,1,How MARKET Protocol differs from traditional exchanges and has the potential to disrupt the quadrillion dollar derivatives market.,"Derivatives represent the largest store of value in the world, with some estimates suggesting the combined value of all derivatives surpasses US$1 quadrillion.

The derivatives market encapsulates a number of different types of trades including over-the-counter and exchange futures, options, forwards, and swaps. The largest derivatives exchange is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), whose volume of contracts executed lies in the billions per year.

Despite the massive size and popularity of derivatives, the nature of existing exchanges and market capabilities incite a number of inefficiencies and shortcomings. The issues faced by legacy exchanges can be addressed and solved by a decentralized alternative like MARKET Protocol.

Built on the Ethereum blockchain, MARKET Protocol ditches a centralized exchange in favor of an ecosystem of dApps and smart contracts, in which the public has full control to view and execute actions on the protocol. This brings full transparency to an otherwise opaque industry. Every single derivative, ongoing or closed, will be viewable forever on the public Ethereum blockchain. This eliminates any fear of the possibility that what is shown https://www.marketprotocol.io/ on the frontend does not match the backend.

This blockchain-based approach also eliminates the role of middlemen and trusted third parties. Derivatives exchanges typically rely on clearing firms to confirm trades and handle customer funds. Sufficient measures are not in place to ensure that the firm operates correctly. This dilemma was made very clear in 2011, when clearing firm MF Global announced a US$1.2 billion shortfall.

When MF Global declared bankruptcy, over 33,000 traders were locked out of trustee controlled funds.

Along with the removal of middlemen, MARKET‚Äôs decentralized approach removes inefficiencies or inequities perpetuated by the exchange itself through inclusivity to all traders. Centralized exchanges greatly limit the populations eligible to trade due to outward regulations and inward restrictions.

Not only must traders on these markets match certain levels of verification and accreditation, they still often require a broker to place trades for them. Anyone in the world can communicate with the Ethereum blockchain, which similarly means that anyone can interact with MARKET Protocol.

In addition to the inclusivity presented, this decentralized approach also greatly empowers traders in the freedom to trade exactly what and how they wish to trade. Entities like CME and CBOE choose only to list commodities believed to earn volume-listing based on values such as the open interest and market activity of the commodity.

MARKET Protocol, on the other hand, is universal. Traders have the full capacity to open contracts in relation to any commodity. Whether a niche locality or global output, traders maintain the unwavering right to trade whatever they believe to be the most profitable derivative.

MARKET Protocol also offers support for a wide variety of currencies to be used as collateral. This includes the more than 600 tokens listed on Coinmarketcaps that use the Etherum network. This additionally includes the asset-backed tokens provided by Digix, such as the DGX stablecoin, which is backed by gold.

Derivatives exchanges, in comparison, typically only accept USD as collateral. Even in the case of cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, the currencies accepted as collateral remain very limited. For example, the leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, BitMEX, only accepts Bitcoin as collateral.

MARKET Protocol also insures against forced liquidations. Every order executed specifies dates and values for closing the given contract. As there is no fluctuating margin component, forced liquidations do not take place whatsoever. This protects traders on both ends of a commodity from squeezes, where prices can artificially explode upwards or downwards when forced liquidations occur.

In extreme circumstances, the outcome of such events can carry heavy implications. For example, a large sale of Ethereum on GDAX in June of 2017 triggered a short squeeze where long futures were force liquidated, leading to more and more ETH sales and even more forced liquidations. Ultimately, ETH experienced a flash crash, dipping momentarily to US$0.10 as the entire buy book was eliminated.

During times of huge volatility in Bitcoin, BitMEX traders often find themselves unable to place and close contracts. In some instances, individuals are unable to access the site entirely, simply due to the hardware behind the exchange failing to keep up with request volume. As MARKET is built directly upon the blockchain, all contracts created and matched are verified and fulfilled by the Ethereum network. There is no risk that open operations cannot be performed and new trades cannot be placed.

Lastly, derivatives exchanges operate similar to a network of digital IOUs. That is, when trades take place, values behind the trade‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääboth the collateral and the commodity, do not necessarily trade hands. As mentioned earlier, such a system can lead to dire consequences, such as insolvency. On the MARKET Protocol, when contracts open, funds are transferred from the traders to the smart contract itself, where funds are frozen in escrow on the blockchain. At the close of the contract, the contents of the trade are transferred to their respective owners.

Given all these differences, there is certainly a case to be made that decentralized derivatives exchanges, pioneered by MARKET Protocol, represent a worthwhile system of trading that has the potential to disrupt the quadrillion dollar derivatives market. MARKET Protocol represents an exciting and empowering opportunity to trade with more freedom and ownership than has ever been possible, especially for traders that have been victim to the faults of legacy exchanges.

M17 Entertainment is a company that gives users the ability to stream content in real time, post pictures, share videos, and communicate with other users. This company was established last year after a significant percentage of 17 Media‚Äôs shares were bought by Paktor in 2016.

In April 2017, Paktor, a dating platform based in Singapore, and 17 Media, a platform for video streaming based in Taiwan, decided to merge. Since then, the collaboration has experienced great fortune and significant development in terms of content live-stream. The platform is operational in a host of countries including Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.
More than 90% of M17‚Äôs revenue is derived from the 40 million recognized users worldwide who live stream approximately 500,000 hours every month.
IPO Filing
On May 11th, 2018, M17 Entertainment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the opportunity to garner a maximum of $115 million during its initial public offering. With its creation in 2013, this Taiwan-based company has booked $116 million from sales for twelve months‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich came to a close on March 31, 2018.
M17 Entertainment plans to furnish an application for the opportunity to be listed as ‚ÄúYQ‚Äù on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company says that underwriters to the initial public offering will include Deutsche Bank Securities, Citigroup and Daiwa Capital Markets. Also, Mizuho Securities will be one of the underwriters to the initial public offering.
The set-out IPO price is just a rough approximation meant to be used to calculate the registration fee of the Securities and Exchange Commission. With initial public offerings, the process isn‚Äôt always straightforward as there is very strict regulatory scrutiny.
The Founder
Jeffrey Huang is a Taiwanese-based musician, entertainer, and innovator. For a long time, Jeff has been interested in revolutionary technologies. Even as far back as 1998, Jeff was already technology oriented and this would later lead to the creation of 17 Media. He is well-known and his constant recognition of innovative technologies has meant him blazing ahead of most of his peers in the industry.

Even before it‚Äôs merge with Paktor, Jeff‚Äôs app had already been one of the best live streaming apps in the whole of Asia. In no time, the app became the foremost app in countries like Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The app has made an entrance to the Japanese market and its plan is to become a very large platform with the hope of knocking the traditional media off its perch.
Jeff is also the founder of Mithril‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa decentralized social media platform that hands incentives to users who create content. These rewards are in the form of tokens which are earned via social mining.
M17 Entertainment &amp; Mithril

Users of both the M17 Entertainment app and Lit‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMithril‚Äôs app‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwill be pretty ecstatic if both platforms can be integrated. M17 users will be able to earn money while sharing their posts, live streaming content, and videos. M17 Entertainment will also benefit from Mithril‚Äôs blockchain technology which ensures that the transactions of all parties are safeguarded. M17‚Äôs 40 million existing customers might also serve Mithril well as the platform can integrate with virtually any social media platform."

That is to say, cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology is different from anything that existed before. 

But in another sense, Bitcoin is not unique. History is replete with fundamentally new things coming market. Amazon as an exclusively online retailer was new in this sense when it came about. Microsoft as an operating system could be said to have been new in a similar way when it came about. 

Is there a good historical comparison for the meteoric rise of Bitcoin? Not something that was just once fundamentally new, but that has more compelling resonances with Bitcoin than simply being fundamentally new or a first-mover?

One could look at the NASDAQ (with focus on 1998-2002). But can the NASDAQ bubble be compellingly compared to Bitcoin, or are there reasons to believe that if Bitcoin is a bubble it is at least a different *kind* of bubble than that of the NASDAQ? Why or why not? Does NASDAQ being based on stocks which in turn are supported by a possibility of accessing collateral make it uncomparable, or not?

What would you say is the historic example of a bubble that can *best* be likened to Bitcoin?--and why do you think other potential candidates for comparison are less apt?"

THE ETHBAY IDEOLOGY

What is Ethbay?

Ethbay is a decentralized online marketplace that is closely similar to eBay, which creates an environment for users to buy or sell tangible or intangible items using Ethereum as the only base currency. In contrast to most online marketplaces, Ethbay charges a substantially lower fee than any other standard fiat marketplace. Ethbay charges no listing fees for sellers on the platform, opening up the space to free listings, which is in stark contrast to the accepted industry standard.

Benefits of the ethbay platform

After proper scrutiny of the Ethbay project, I can boldly point out some benefits of using the platform in comparison to existing marketplaces and also other benefits of participating its ICO. These advantages are listed as follows;

√ò **Moderate fees**: In comparison to other fiat marketplaces and systems of trading, the costs of using Ethbay is by far cheaper.

√ò **Security and Safety**\- Users are guaranteed of their absolute privacy. Also, the escrow service is an excellent way of ensuring users don‚Äôt lose funds to scammers during transactions.

√ò **ICO Bonus**\- For those getting in early on the ICO, they are guaranteed to enjoy a 10&amp;#37;, 15&amp;#37; and 25&amp;#37; bonuses during the initial ICO launch.

√ò **Decentralization**\- There is absolutely no dictatorship in the ethbay marketplace as no central authority controls the marketplace and only token holders and the users are responsible.

MY VERDICT

i. I have encountered few ICO projects to create decentralized marketplace, but never seen a project like Ethbay which integrates the ethereum blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform where users have absolute anonymity and autonomy. The Ethbay technology promises great and limitless capabilities and can be considered to be very profitable for the early birds \(Early investors\) because of its pre\-sale opportunity. The Whitepaper is properly developed and written with adequate technical information. This project is A GO!

ii. I feel the Ethbay Ideology and concept is highly applicable to real life situations.

iii. The hard cap for the Ethbay ICO is 15000 ETH which looks okay to me and gives me confidence as I feel the mark will be achieved within a short period considering the usefulness and applicability of the Ethbay platform. Looking at the Soft cap budget allocation, I was impressed knowing that 60&amp;#37; of the funds from the Token Sale will be used to develop the platform with no percentage set aside for the team and founders. This fosters a high level of confidence for me.

iv. I am positive on this project for flipping and long\-term holding.

&gt;*‚ÄúThe online betting market is on the threshold of tectonic change. Blockchain will revolutionize the industry, significantly expanding the user base by ushering in new standards for functionality and reliability that will radically change the way individuals interact with each other. The Bettium platform will present a cleaner, more responsible alternative to the traditional bookmaker, fundamentally altering perceptions of sports betting and encouraging wider participation from the community as a whole: bettors, players, advertisers and industry professionals. We intend to show the positive side of the betting industry, providing tools and algorithms that will allow even amateur bettors the chance to play like the experts. Betting today stands at the intersection of sports, technology and logic‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand Bettium is the key,‚Äù* *says Alan Hunt, Bettium CEO.*

**Bettium** will truly level the playing field between professionals and amateurs by providing all users with equal capabilities and the same professional-grade tools, such as the platform‚Äôs built-in AI assistant (nicknamed ‚ÄúMerlin‚Äù), which will not only process Big Data and help users make educated decisions, but also allow to automatically execute their own betting strategies. Those who prefer to rely on the expertise of professionals will be able to subscribe to expert forecasts, mimicking their bets or even completely entrusting wagers to a fund manager for a small fee. The transparency and security of such relationships will be guaranteed by smart contracts and facilitated with a rating system allowing users to assess expert capabilities.

The project expects to capture a significant share of the online betting market, which has more than doubled over the past decade and is projected to reach US$52 billion in 2018. Bettium will help transform the industry from of loose collection of semi-respectable and unregulated bookmakers to an established institution with functionality that ensures safety and transparency for the common bettor. Blockchain technology and smart contracts will be used for deposits, payouts, transactions and risk coverage, eliminating the pitfalls of traditional systems, such as lack of transparency, technical vulnerability, excessive fees, low bet limits and high deposit requirements. Change is inevitable in today‚Äôs market and Bettium will be at the forefront.

Bettium team has already announced the details of its public crowdsale. The **pre-sale** of BETT tokens is to begin on **July 1**, and the open phase of the crowdsale on July 10, 2018.

In FinServ‚Äôs World Of Strict Rules, Data Management Flexibility Is Key   


""..Far\-reaching data protection regulations like PSD2 are both a consequence and catalyst of change in how financial service providers store, manage and use data. As banking services and products digitize, that means institutions have more data to handle ‚Äì much, much more ‚Äì impacting everything from compliance to customer relations.   


Corporate banking is a significant part of this digital transformation. Analysts at Boston Consulting Group estimated earlier this year that novel digital financial services platforms like ePayments, cross\-border transactions and supply chain financing will yield nearly a third of corporate banking revenue.   


But in an environment in which compliance pressures are rising, profits are declining and competition from FinTechs continues to build, the way in which corporate banks manage their data can mean sink or swim..""

102,2018-06-04,azooo,0,Lets talk about cryptocurrencies,"I was a bit reluctant to post this here since I have a feeling you guys don't like this topic, but then again it seems to me that this is the only sub where I can expect at least one intelligent response.

I'd like to believe I have a good technical background and understand how Bitcoin and other cryptos work and after closely examining the projects in this space it seems like, with the exception of Bitcoin, they offer no real use case. In addition, all this ""blockchain"" hype is pure buzzword with no real usage. Yes, there are things in the banking industry that can be made more efficient but using centralized databases would be much more reasonable and efficient. What is concerning is that many big companies are hyping this up and the technical managers seem to see big things for blockchain technology. Judging from history there were technically inferior things that the market still pushed forward so  juding things only from a technical perspective is not that useful.

On to the market situation.  There are now more than 1600 cryptocurrencies with a combined market cap of 330 B. The number of ICO sales in May topped last year's sale and there are projects that raised billions (!) of dollars without having any product, not to mention that the product they want to develop seem to have no valuable use or future potential.

What I do lack is market understanding and experience. Doing research, it seems to me that this whole mess is very similar to the dot-com bubble, although the (mis) understanding of the technology is much wider than in the dot-com era.  

So I was wondering if anyone could share their thoughts on how you see this market playing out in the future? My hypothesis is that everything other than Bitcoin is currently useless and hence should be valueless. But I don't know how to model this situation in a profitable investment. 

Is it realistic to expect that in 5+ years, there will still be thousands of cryptocurrencies and people willing to trade them? What could be potential catalysts to stop this expansion? Could you draw some parallels from similar phenomenons ? (please dont mention tulips)

My intuition is that anything but Bitcoin should eventually fail but there were many instances in the tech world when inferior solutions were far more successful and adopted than technically superior counterparts. (an example would be the DOS operating system vs Unix) 

So I would really be curios to hear how you guys see this thing play out in the long term. Can we expect big exchanges like Binance (raking in hundreds of dollars of yearly profit) simply disappearing once the dust settles? Or is it realistic to expect that this kind of market action (buying and selling useless coins) takes off in the long term?"

105,2018-07-25,RySi_N7,0,Investing In Blockchain Technology,"Hello Vanguard ETF lovers

TLDR: Where to invest in the underlying Blockchain technology, not the digital currency it's associated with

Some background: I am a 20 something Canadian university student looking to invest some money. I'd love to invest in real estate but the Vancouver market is way to hot. High interest bank accounts are preferable for money that may be needed within a short term like 5 years and I have already set some money aside. I have a regular checking/saving account through a major bank for ""oh shit I need money right fucking now"" and am a bit old school by carrying cash just in case. Assume no debt or major upcoming payments (as to avoid save some money for now kid answers). Also assume a 5k investment budget (hypothetical) via TFSA

The Challenge: I'd like to invest in the underlying blockchain technology. It is most often synonymous with bitcoin, and although I realize I can purchase a small piece of bitcoin instead of the entire nearly 20k for one coin, I believe bitcoin to be too speculative. Too expensive for major drops or raises in short periods of time. I realize other currencies such as lithium exist but I'm not interested in the currency. The technology that powers the digital currency has the potential to really shake things up. Estonia for instance has moved most of their government services over to a blockchain based system which increased security and efficiency. However, despite my research (complete and utter novice research at that) I cannot find a way to invest in blockchain without investing in the associated currency. My thinking is it's akin to investing in a laptop without wanting to invest in the entire ecosystem that compose Microsoft, apple, Samsung etc. Is my assumption correct? Or is there some way to invest in the underlying technology that I am missing?"

114,2018-07-10,FacelessOnes,0,"Soblo, Society of Blockchain, a blockchain development consortium","On      the 26th of June, there was an announcement regarding a blockchain      consortium called Soblo, the Society of Blockchain. Soblo (Society  of     Blockchain) is the blockchain development consortium formed by  four     startups in the following order: KStarLive, Doogle, LegalBlock,  and     UnderPin. The consortium allows the efficiency and security  that a     public blockchain provides, meanwhile allowing for some  degree of     central control, which grants more security and monitoring  through their     services and data. This creates an ease to the  barrier to entry and     firmly reiterates on the purpose of the  consortium‚Äôs purpose, which  is    to provide a free and open smart  contract environment suitable for     reverse ICOs.

By  the formation of a    blockchain development consortium, the  members  of the consortium are    able to lessen the barrier to entry and  lower  the entrance cost by    sharing the cost of development and  operation.  Upon being initiated  into   the Soblo Consortium, all SOBLO  members  agree to run their nodes  in a   unified and collaborative  manner. Over  the years, blockchain  has seen   many issues and problems  with the  way the blockchain systems  are   governed. They have based  themselves  on wealth accumulation,  meaning   that whoever had the most  coins had  more say in decision  making process   for the future  operations and  issues that are to be  faced. Needless to   say, the  issues that are  raised about the mining  problems are still not    confronted after all  these years as well. EOS  tends to reward miners    based off how much  block is mined. However,  block mining takes much    computing power, as  well as time, which leads  to many inconveniences. At    the end of the  day, it is not certain how  much EOS the miners will    acquire, which  creates many uncertainties  for the holders of EOS. Also,    the holders  of EOS are not guaranteed  of the stability of EOS because   of  its  volatility as well. The good  news that we have is that SOBLO   will   not require or have mining,  therefore will not be rewarding people    based  on these kinds of  incentives or activities. Instead, SOBLO will    reward  its users based  on the value that they add to the blockchain    through  alternative  means such as driving traffic or creating user    content for  various  platforms related to the Soblo Consortium.

Also,     speaking on Reverse ICO‚Äôs, Reverse ICO‚Äôs main problems are  ‚Äúgas‚Äù   price   and transaction speed. However, SOBLO has developed a way  to   solve  both  problems. Due to the Soblo Consortium members working    together,  there  won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúgas‚Äù price that users will have to pay.    For example,   KStarCoin is based off Ethereum, which indicates that    there will be one   transaction every seven seconds. However, we    understand that for some   services we provide, one transaction every    seven seconds would be   inefficient. SOBLO has found a way to process    1000 transactions every   second, which would be extremely helpful for    ticketing purposes in   regards to one of the consortium members like    KStarcoin, which is a   platform that involves itself on crowd funding    concerts through its   Hallyu fans.

ETnews,   one of the biggest   electronic news websites in South Korea,  wrote  an  article about SOBLO.   This article goes more in detail over  how  SOBLO  came to be and how the   consortium is an enormous benefit for   all who  are part of KStarlive and   its blockchain, KStarcoin."

Is this pump warranted &amp; with the Trump administration talking about regulations on Google what does this mean for investors? I know myself find it odd that all markets are pushing new highs are there any older investors in here have seen all markets DOW/GOLD/BTC/HOUSE markets rocket in price at the same time? how are you guys playing this news? I've set up my portfolio: 20% BTC bot / 30% USD pairs for a fast exit/ 10% altcoins /20% USD/ 20% Gold. everyone has their own strategy but I figured the news that Trump would look into Google might start a demand for a blockchain based internet open, fair &amp; transparent.

Have you heard about a new technology called encryp currency? Well there is a new investment opportunity, a much more stable and faster coin based not on blockchain, but on an encryp block. Encryp currency isn't cryptocurrency, it is different, therefore exciting. The coin I am talking about is called Skipjack Dime. Skipjack is a global digital currency managed by the Feistel Core Network (FCN). It can be sent anywhere and to anyone and is convenient to use. It‚Äôs structure also makes it great for the environment Skipjack is the world first encryption currency as oppose to traditional fiat money, digital currency and crypto currency, called Encryp Currency. Superencryp Block Foundation (SEB), a global collaboration skipjack network founded in 2018 by Skipjack Corporation.  Over 50,000 global urban influentials are members, with the ability to build worth through leveraged collaboration. The group is supporting the new superencryp block which is more faster than a blockchain.

Right now the price of 1 Skipjack Dime is 1.76 USD and if our calculations are right, it will be about 6USD by the middle of Fall and 1.91 by the next week! Make sure to get your Skipjack and don't miss out on the possible gains! It doesn't matter if you are here for short term or for long term, we can do both!

Let's say 5 years ago

* Everything was hosted locally or with an IT provider. Citrix for example was popular
* The number of apps in iOS app store and Play store have tripled - mobile is king
* Businesses slowly started to look at technology as a need and not as a luxury

Now 

* SaaS is king, hosting data in Azure, AWS or Google's data centers is popular
* Citrix is still used but in a different capacity
* You need a mobile app to pair with your website / company to be looked at seriously
* eCommerce has been changed dramatically with Square &amp; competitors

So what's next?

* Edge networking?
* A boom in security spending?
* Machine learning?
* Blockchain?
* VR &amp; AR?

127,2018-08-17,TG_King,0,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink: The Risk Is Worth The Reward","Anyone putting any amount of money into cryptocurrency needs to consider risk vs reward. Is the risk of losing a large percentage of your investment worth the potential reward of massive returns? I will attempt to outline why I believe that buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink is a risk worth taking.



**Bitcoin**



Whether you like it or not, Bitcoin is here to stay and it is likely to remain the main store of value and transactional currency in the crypto economy. It has enabled a global currency that is not issued or controlled by any centralized authority, allowing you to send value to anyone in any location without any risk of any entity stopping or intercepting the transaction. It is the most secure network in the world due to the robustness of its proof of work consensus mechanism. An attack on the bitcoin network itself is astronomically cost prohibitive and is unlikely to even be attempted in any serious manor.


Layer 2 solutions are being tested on the Bitcoin main net and will soon bring scalability to the network and enable micro transactions. This will make Bitcoin more functional as a currency.


Scarcity is one of the reasons Bitcoin‚Äôs price per coin is so high. There will never be more than 21 million coins in existence. If Bitcoin is adopted in any significant capacity as a payment method and/or as a store of value it would not be unreasonable to see it valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.


BTC price at the time of writing - $6400 Current 
Market Cap - $110 Billion



**Ethereum**



Ethereum uses the same blockchain technology as bitcoin but takes it one step further. Ethereum is Turing complete which allows for decentralized applications to run on the network using smart contracts. Smart contracts are simple ‚Äúif, then‚Äù computations that occur autonomously on the network in a decentralized, trust-less manor. This has many real world implications, but I‚Äôll use sports betting as a simple example. Let‚Äôs say I want to bet my friend that the Warriors will win the NBA finals again next season. We can put our money into a smart contract that is programmed to pay out the winner of the bet as soon as the event has occurred. If the warriors win, the money will be sent to me by the contract. I do not have to trust that my friend will pay me. We do not have to trust a centralized party to hold our money and execute the pay out. We only have to trust math and math doesn‚Äôt tend to lie.


Ethereum also allows developers to create their own tokens on top of the network which has created an entire separate economy of ICOs (initial coin offerings) and digital collectibles (crypto kitties are actually very cool).


Ethereum already has alliances with many major companies and is positioned to be the main smart contracts platform in the cryptocurrency economy. Ether (ETH) is used as gas to power the Ethereum network and will continue to increase in value in tandem with the usage of the network.


Also, Ethereum will soon be switching from proof of work to proof of stake. As soon as that switch occurs ETH holders will be able to stake their ETH in nodes and earn more in return for running the network. Not only does this provide passive income for holders, but it will also lead to a rise in the price of ETH due The the fact that many coins will be locked in nodes thus suppressing the supply.


ETH price at the time of writing - $290 
Market Cap - $27 Billion



**Chainlink**



Let‚Äôs go back to my sports betting example. The smart contract that my friend and I are using for our bet needs to know who won the NBA finals in order to know whether to pay me or my friend. If that data is not being fed into our smart contract in a decentralized, trust-less manor then our contract itself is no longer decentralized and trust-less. That is where Chainlink comes in. Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that will allow trust-less data integration onto any blockchain. One of the most valuable aspects of Chainlink is that it is blockchain agnostic and can be used for any public, private, or permissioned blockchain. Currently one of their main focuses is to provide blockchain solutions for interbank telecommunications. They are working with Swift which is the main organization in this field.


Chainlink is not yet functional making it the riskiest endeavor of the 3, but it also has the highest potential for reward. There are currently no competitors in the decentralized oracle space. The reason being that the oracle problem is an incredibly difficult problem to solve and the creator of Chainlink has been working on it for over 4 years which is an eternity in the blockchain world. The main net is nearly complete and should be released within the next few months although there is no specific release date.


Once Chainlink is online, people will be able to run nodes to help feed data into smart contracts. The node operators will be paid for this service. Running a node is not as simple a staking, but there are companies such as Linkpool that will allow anyone to contribute their Link tokens to a node and enjoy some of the profits. This will have a similar effect as ETH in limiting the supply and likely increasing the price.


LINK price at the time of writing - $.26 
Market Cap - $95 Million



Many people are currently saying that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will never again reach their all time highs of last year, but let‚Äôs take a look at the numbers. The total crypto market cap at the all time high was approximately $800 Billion. This is not a large number to begin with, but it‚Äôs also inflated due to the way market cap is calculated in cryptocurrencies. Market cap is determined by coin supply multiplied by the last price per coin. This means that I could create my own coin right now with a supply of 1 million coins, sell 1 coin to 1 person for $1 and my coin would be said to have a market cap of $1 million. This is clearly not actually the case. That being said, even $800 billion is not much when you consider the fact that Apple just hit $1 Trillion by itself and that the dot com bubble didn‚Äôt burst until it reached a $2 trillion market cap.


Large financial institutions don‚Äôt have easy access to cryptocurrencies yet, but they are interested and they will have access very soon. Most likely in the form of a Bitcoin ETF. The last crypto bull run was fueled by retail investors. The next one will be fueled by institutional investors and it will be magnitudes greater in size.


Putting money into crypto right now is still risky, but the potential reward is massive. Not only for huge returns on your initial investment, but also for streams of passive income from currencies such as ETH and LINK. We may be seeing the beginning of the world‚Äôs next great technological innovation and this time you can invest in it directly. Opportunities like this don‚Äôt arise often, so I highly recommend giving this one some thought."

**STREAMLINING TEDIOUS KYC PROCESSES FOR BUSINESSES WHILST ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO CONTROL THE FATE OF THEIR OWN IDENTITY.**

    PRICE:  $0.007826 USD
VOLUME 24H: $2,825,041 USD 
MARKET CAP: $19,004,582 USD 

PROBLEM TO SOLVE

Currently, we place an enormous amount of trust in centralised authorities to store and manage our identity. Such organisations entitle us to essential human rights such as financial services, citizenship/passport registration and business licenses. As with all centralised entities they are incredibly prone to hacking resulting from a single point of failure, all user data is stored in one single place. This has too often resulted in our identities being exploited for criminal purposes such as identity fraud, as seen in the Equifax hack where 143 million users identity were stolen from a central database.

Coupled with this inefficient management of sensitive data, the current process of completing mandatory KYC (Know Your Customer) processes for business is cumbersome, costly and repetitive. KYC ensures that client identities are fully assessed before any business relationships are formed to avoid the risk of illegal or fraudulent interactions. They span numerous jurisdictions and are therefore widely used by firms all over the world. Sharing sensitive identity data to numerous centralised databases has it proposed risks, but perhaps more poignant is how much time and energy is spent completing such a process repeatedly.

### 

### SOLUTION

Such inadequacies with the current status quo have lead Selfkey (KEY) to provide an innovative solution. In essence, KEY aim to empower individuals and businesses to possess full control over their own identities by eradicating the need for unnecessary and unsecure centralised intermediaries. Their digital identity system based on the Ethereum Blockchain will allow users to upload all necessary documentation to ensure they are fully compliant to pursue any venture which needs identity verification, whether this is for commercial or personal purposes. By combining all necessary documents in one place on their desktop and mobile app, which only the user has access to via their individual public key, applying for financial services, passport/citizenship and business endeavours that need KYC compliance becomes simple. Thus, for businesses, KEY eliminates the mundane and costly repetition of KYC registrations and for individuals, KEY allows easy access to essential services and ultimately empowering people to own their identity without relying on other unreliable middlemen.

### APPLICATIONS

Once the platform goes live in Q4 2019, individuals and businesses will be able to purchase a variety of products and services via the Selfkey marketplace utilising the KEY Token, including but not limited to, bank accounts, residency, KYC licences and real estate. Additionally one will be able to manage their cryptocurrency assets, including the KEY token itself and any other ERC-20 tokens. Conversely, unlike many other cryptocurrency firms, KEY already has a working beta of their desktop wallet which looks incredibly professional and KEY also provide an online demo of different functions the desktop wallet will be able to achieve in the future. In a space which is often incredibly difficult to understand from the outside, this a refreshing approach that allows users to gain a deeper insight into how the platform will function in the future. After all, as with all technology, once Blockchain technology is integrated into our daily lives the end users are unlikely to be interested in how things operate in the backend as long as they serve their desired purpose.

### 

### SUMMARY

Ultimately, Selfkey‚Äôs accumulation of necessary documents needed for typical business and personal interactions should reduce time and costs for both parties. KYC registration may be their killer application for businesses, whilst individuals ability to determine how to efficiently manage their own identity should gain further appeal. Still in its infancy, Selfkey has a bright future ahead of itself and if they live up to their roadmap they should become incredibly profitable for long-term investors. Be sure not to miss out!

### 

### CATALYSTS

* **Proven Ability:** Key team members behind Selfkey have already proved their ability to successfully manage a large-scale project from start-up to finish with their successful venture KYC Chain, a KYC solutions provider, that is already working with numerous blue-chip firms
* **Firm Foundations:** The interconnectivity between KYC Chain and Selfkey allows the business to focus solely on Blockchain development and user experience as the infrastructure and expertise in the business of KYC is already established
* **Consumer Awareness:** The major Equifax hack alongside the Cambridge Analytica Facebook scandal has lead to an increasing number of individuals becoming more aware of how their identity can be stolen or misused for illicit purposes, ensuring demand for having more control over one's own identity
* **Familiarity with KYC:** Every time one wishes to participate in an ICO they have to go through the KYC process, this is a repetitive and long-winded process which many cryptocurrency users are familiar with and would certainly avoid if possible, creating more demand

### 

### RISK FACTORS

* **Serious Competition:** There are other notable other firms trying to provide a digital identity solution using Blockchain technology such as Civic, which has been long established, although Selfkey‚Äôs clear advantage is the deep-rooted industry connections that KYC Chain has provided
* **Slow Timeline:** For a business that already has such firm industry foundations their timeline is not particularly fast, with continual developments throughout 2019, there will certainly be a race to become the market leader in the digital identity space, although it is also important that everything is completed to the highest of standards

### 

### EVENTS

* **30th September:** Alpha launch of SelfKey Corporate Identity Wallet desktop app, Alpha launch of SelfKey mobile app and Partnership work with governments and utility providers
* **31st December:** Beta launch of SelfKey desktop app

### 

### CONCLUSION

Selfkey is an innovative identity platform which aims to streamline the verification process for a variety of services by allowing both individuals and businesses to retain full ownership of their identity. KEY‚Äôs killer application is the ability to aggregate all information necessary for KYC processes in one place, whilst only allowing the user access to such information via their public key. This should save a considerable amount of time and expense for businesses all over the world who regularly must be KYC compliant before exchanging value with others.

Of course, this is merely one poignant application KEY offers, the platform will also provide individuals and businesses with access to financial services, citizenship, business licenses and health insurance, to name a few. It is likely the KYC validation market is where we will see KEY thrive first as a result of their successful parent company KYC Chain. Although, with such a wide-ranging market, opportunities for clients and growth are endless. For this reason, Selfkey is one not to miss out on and should be on your watchlist.

If in the beginning, for the majority of the population, it was a new and completely unfamiliar term, it is now widely believed that the future is precisely behind the technology of the distributed registry.

Blockchain is a decentralized database, which consists of blockchain linked together. Each next blockchain carries a link to the previous one. Information is not stored on one server, but is distributed among all participants.

At first, the Blockchain was used only in the sphere of crypto-currency and finance. Today, the area of its distribution is much wider, and certainly will continue to develop more actively. The technology of the distributed registry is successfully applied in the sphere of healthcare, logistics, real estate, management of guarantees, and this is far from the limit.

Regularly there are news that world-famous companies are planning to introduce Blockchain technologies: Steam, Alibaba, Apple, Google, Coca-Cola. Even the stars of the football club Barcelona have created their social network on the basis of the blockchain. Platform NYiGDE? is no exception! We could not miss the introduction of such an important tool for users.

131,2018-09-29,hemokwang,0,What Does DT Deflationary Era Inspire Us?,"**Introduction**

Several days ago, [DragonEx](https://dragonex.im/)¬†announced that the production of Dragon Token would decrease by half as from November 2, 2018, according to the smart contract, and they would also reduce their token share to ensure that Dragon Token would step into a deflationary period, with the return of interests to their communities. 

**What are inflation and deplation of tokens?**

Inflation of tokens refers to a condition when there is too much supply of the token into the digital market leading to the decrease in value. On the other hand, deflation of tokens¬†could imply decreasing production of¬†this token¬†which leads to increasing¬†value of it. There has been inflation of [Dragon Token](https://dragonex.im/en-us/news/article/622?curIdx=-1)¬†(DT)¬†since it's launched on November 2, 2017. Technically, the inflation lowers the value of each DT¬†on a daily basis. However, the¬†condition is being different since the mining difficulty will increase from November 2, 2018 according to the DT Smart Contract. With the supply of DT reduced, the value of it will¬†increase and be able to stabilize with time.¬†At the same time, the inflation of DT will be¬†significantly¬†reduced which will then result to deflation of the token. 

**How DT¬†inflation comes to an end?**

DT¬†is generated through mining, with a total volume of¬†37,339,500. The smart contract releases once per 24-hour, which counts to¬†3,650¬†times in total. Each¬†cycle consists of 365 releases¬†and every release¬†has¬†51,200 outputs of DT during the first cycle, which will be halved for the next cycle period. The whole process will be repeated and the production¬†of DT¬†will decrease which¬†means¬†that their value will¬†gradually increase,¬†leading to deflation mechanism. ¬†

**DT¬†deflationary era**

It was mentioned in the announcement [***With Great Effort and Commitment Comes Great Reward***](https://dragonex.im/en-us/news/article/1164?curIdx=0) on DragonEx, ‚ÄúDT (Dragon Token) Dividends have been distributed over 300 times so far, with more than 47 million USDT distributed to the DT community! ¬†This works out to 9.11 USDT per DT held.‚Äù According to the smart contract, the production of this token will keep on decreasing. And in the meanwhile,¬†the repurchased dragon token will be burned to ensure a shift occurs from inflation to deflation.

**How does DT** **deflation work?** 

By November 2, 2018, it is estimated that about 18,688,000 DT¬†will¬†have released. According to the DT¬†smart contract, the production of DT¬†will decrease from 51,200 to 25,600 every 24 hours. Thereafter,¬†DragonEx team will burn¬†the permanent frozen DT¬†that is not in the market circulation so that the total amount of DT¬†will never go beyond 18,688,000. The trend is expected to continue even for the coming years such that by November 2, 2019,¬†the share of DT held by DragonEx will be reduced from 50% to 25%, whereby at the same date 2020 it will have reduced to 12.5%. ¬†

As the mining of token regresses,¬†the decrement cycle¬†of the dragon token will enter into the deflation period. Assuming that everything in the market remains at its expected condition, and then this will imply that a reduction in holding capacity is in good faith to maintain the stability of investors' interest.

**What can we learn from this?**

The majority of the tokens issued by blockchain technology are in the inflation phase. Only a few that has adopted the new deflation trend because it's still a new concept in the market. It is observed that it‚Äôs difficult to control huge inflation in a broad-based¬†blockchain technology when it's still in early stages. However, it becomes very necessary for another developmental phase so that a coin¬†or token¬†maintains its value. In general, the deflation mechanism is expected to assist stabilizing cryptocurrency project and attract investors to do investment when is more stable with high equity value. 

However, will it work? ¬†And who will be the next DragonEx? 

Let‚Äôs wait and see!"

In [*7 Big Obstacles To Mass Adoption Of Blockchain Technology*](https://medium.com/the-crypto-times/7-big-obstacles-to-mass-adoption-of-blockchain-technology-87740cdda9fe), Niklas G√∂ke compares the adoption of blockchain to the adoption of the global Internet. ‚ÄúToday, as we‚Äôre closing in on 30 years of the commercial web, we‚Äôre just about to reach 50% global penetration.‚Äù He argues that while it might feel like blockchain should‚Äôve solved all our problems already, it will likely follow the same, slow trajectory of adoption that all new tech goes through, as blockchain technology is still just beginning to encounter the obstacles and challenges associated with mass expansion.

To acquire the level of global success that the Internet has reached in the last 30 years, Blockchain will have to:

This feels almost unreal. 130k was my life savings. I'm unsure of what to do and I cry everyday. Please help me. I don't think I should sell because I have lost so much already. But maybe there's a way I can write this off as a loss and profit from it? "

143,2018-10-23,hatter6822,1,A few thoughts on crypto-assets during this time of global market turmoil: My experience transitioning to a new market,"I have lurked on this sub for many years now and have enjoyed listening to and researching all the ideas and tips you guys provide. 

**A little about me:** I started investing in the stock market in my 20s. I won some, I lost some but overall I basically just followed the normal growth trend found in the market over time. Around 2010, I started to hear about Bitcoin and as a CS engineer I found it very interesting but lacking the foundations to take a dive. I changed my mind in 2011 and bought a few dozen BTC. Once I actually had some BTC I kinda lost interest, that is until about 2013 when a kid named Vitalik started posting about his upcoming project on a bitcoin forum I went to occasionally. The way he envisioned a truly programmable blockchain versus just using blockchain for cryptocurrency blew me away to say the least. By this point the in-fighting in BTC was starting to develop quickly, I could feel the community become more toxic. So I moved my originally tiny investment to Ethereum...I figured why the hell not. 

**Back to my more traditional investing:** I have been steadily contributing to my portfolio throughout my adult life. I have worked for a few companies and *once had* a decent traditional portfolio. That changed around August of this year, when I began DCAing into the crypto-market and divesting ~80% of my traditional portfolio to enter my favorite crypto-assets. I now hold roughly 90% crypto-assets and ~10% traditional stocks, and since the investment I have been surprisingly comfortable with the added risk in my portfolio. Below is what I have found out so far by making this big leap:

**The Good:** I have to say it feels kind of nice and extremely odd to be able to actually buy things online directly with my investments if and when I choose to, without having to involve a broker or bank. I have chosen to twice so far, mainly for experimentation. Both were just as fast as a credit card purchase online, with a cost of roughly ~$0.001. The other good part is thus far I have actually gained money compared to what my traditional portfolio would currently be worth if I had kept it in. Let's see if this trend continues. I obviously believe it will or I wouldn't have done this lol. Not only that, with 0x rolling out traditional securities soon I will be able to seamlessly buy back into what ever stock I feel like and rebuild my traditional portfolio from within the crypto-asset world when I feel like it is time. Also, I have already opened my own MakerDAO CDP and have locked in my current dollar cost while holding a huge amount of my wealth in the stablecoin DAI. So even though I am technically in a very volatile asset (ETH), I still get the perks of holding something that *thus far* has shown itself to be as stable as the USD. 

**The Bad:** This ecosystem is still in its infancy in *many but not all ways.* Your personal understanding of computer science and IT security are still massively important at this stage. So unless you plan to solely use a custody service such as Fidelity, Coinbase, etc., which are perfectly good options, you had better not make the leap yet. I'm not sure if I should categorize this as a bad but I do feel that I am much more involved with and thinking about my portfolio. It's much different from just trusting a brokerage currently, and because of this I am constantly learning about this area of technology and business. You kinda have to be hands on at this point. The only other bad I have found is that bad people are out there, and the threat of them stealing your stuff is high. **You must be completely aware of this and act accordingly.** "

148,2018-10-17,SwachhCoin,1,The Robust Application of Ethereum DAO in Waste Management,"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

INTRODUCTION 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To adequately understand the application of Ethereum DAO in waste management, an examination of the basic concepts becomes necessary. One such concept is Ethereum. Ethereum refers to a decentralized platform on the blockchain technology that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum runs smart contracts and these smart contracts are applications which run exactly as they are programmed. As such, they eliminate the possibility of third-party interference, censorship, downtime, and fraud.

According to *Vitalik Buterin*, the *co-founder of Ethereum*, the Ethereum dream began from the imagination of a platform that transcends just the financial use cases that are allowed by Bitcoin. Buterin has expressed hope that Ethereum will become the solution for all the use cases of blockchain that do not have a specialized system to aid their operations.

Since its inception, it has gone ahead to experience rapid growth and has also enjoyed rapid adoption by a lot of developers. Several companies are also contributing directly or indirectly to the adoption of Ethereum. For instance, *JP Morgan* and *Microsoft* are reportedly some of the organizations that have committed to support Ethereum development through the establishment of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. This alliance has the sole purpose of ensuring that the potential of Ethereum is realized across all industries.

*Ethereum* has contributed to the development of advanced solutions across several industries and the waste management industry is not left out. Waste management refers to all actions and activities involved in dealing with waste right from the production of the waste to its final disposal. That would include, waste collection, transportation, treatment, disposal, and even recycling.

Among other things, waste is managed so as to reduce the adverse effects of improper waste management on health and the environment. However, there is an inadequacy in the current waste management systems. Problems such as lack of proper collection mechanisms, disposal methods, and even lack of in-depth knowledge by the individuals about the environment have all contributed to the inadequacy of the current system. There is, therefore, a need to adopt a system that can foster proper waste management globally. It is in this sense that the application of Ethereum DAO in the waste management system becomes highly relevant.

#### Ethereum DAO

**DAO** also was known as a *Decentralized Autonomous Organization* is simply an organization operated on smart contracts. Ethereum DAO is one of Ethereum applications and is designed to eliminate the need for middlemen. It can be programmed to digitally achieve all that traditional companies can, even in a more efficient manner. Smart contracts on which the Ethereum DAO operates are simply programs that execute functions just the exact way the creators developed them. Smart contracts can be used for different purposes, including but not limited to transferring of funds and can also be used in the waste management industry. For instance, the smart contracts can be set up to automatically transfer rewards to individuals that have properly managed their waste.

#### How Swachhcoin Projects Solves Waste Management Issues Using Ethereum Blockchain

Swachhcoin was developed on the Ethereum Blockchain and that endows it with the general innate features of the Blockchain technology. Swachhcoin was specifically built to solve waste management problems using the Ethereum Blockchain and it seeks to do that through different methods.

For one, Swachhcoin uses an extensive infrastructure that comprises of different smart contracts where all actions in the waste management process will be initiated and recorded in a transparent, traceable and irreversible manner. This gives room for adequate transparency in the waste management process. The fundamental properties and nature of the blockchain technology are such that altering codes, influencing or tampering with them are impossible.

Also, several DAO based actions are being carried out using the Ethereum blockchain so as to streamline the traditional functioning of the current waste management industry that is run on an obsolete infrastructure. This, in the long-run, will aid a faster and more effective waste management process while also eliminating all the issues characterizing the current waste management system.

*The Swachh DAO*, asides the typical features of a blockchain, also has advanced features. For instance, the SwBIN is programmed in such a way that it allows the feature of decentralized advertisement. With this feature, a Swachh token holder can use his tokens to pay for the advertisement of specific content on SwBIN at any location of his choice.

Swachhcoin also has the Rural Welfare program, the operation of which will be aided by the Swachh DAO. The Rural Welfare Program is a program which is neither philanthropic nor charitable. It is majorly an innovative program to set up waste storage facilities in some villages (and subsequent expansion to other villages) to encourage the villagers to store their waste in the waste storage facility. The waste will be collected and the village will receive the monetary reward in the form of Rural Welfare Funds based on the calculations done by the SwBIN reward calculator. It is expected that the reward will be used for the development of such villages. This process is aided by the Swachh DAO.

Another feature of the Swachh DAO is the Autonomous Philanthropy, where Swachhcoin funds for donation purposes are transferred to specific organizations in a manner which is fair and transparent. The infrastructure that exists on the Swachhcoin eliminates the possibility of funds not being distributed to the organization or person for which it was originally intended. All these are made possible as a result of the implementation of the Swachh DAO infrastructure.

In conclusion, the Swachhcoin through the robust application of Ethereum DAO has a lot of potential benefits both in the short term and in the long run. Such benefits include the creation of a global decentralized waste management ecosystem, the provision of a network that offers extensive infrastructure necessary for proper waste management and the positive alteration of people‚Äôs perception about waste to see it as a profitable untapped resource. In addition, it will also benefit the environment as it will lead to an improvement in the environment and ultimately contribute to the profitability of the waste management industry."

161,2018-11-23,Befudleds,1,Private vs Public Blockchain: Differences and Applications. A hybrid blockchain: the golden middle.," 

# Private vs Public Blockchain: Differences and Applications

In a few years, the blockchain technology has greatly evolved and mutated into different types, particularly public and private. Let‚Äôs find out what the difference between these two blockchains is, and how we can reap advantages from both solutions.

## What is a public blockchain?

A public blockchain is an open-source code, which means any person can be the part of the consensus, and no one is in charge. You can read, write, or audit the code ‚Äì the access to the network is free. A public blockchain is trustless: no entity is required to control the operations, and yet the network will stay resistant to censorship. 

Such blockchains as Litecoin or Bitcoin are totally public due to the following facts:

* Anyone can mine BTC or LTC and run the full node.
* Any user can make transactions on LTC or BTC chain.
* Anyone can audit the network using Blockchain explorer.

What protects a decentralized self-governed blockchain? The trustless autonomy is powered by a difficult method of decision making (Proof-Of-Work, Proof-Of-Stake, etc) that is impossible to tamper with.

## What is a private blockchain?

In terms of access, this is an absolute opposite of public blockchain. Here, authorized people only can read and edit the code. Besides, the private blockchain is in power of a single entity or enterprise that can execute and cancel commands on the blockchain. In that sense, a private blockchain cannot be called fully decentralized ‚Äì this is just a distributed ledger that leverages cryptography to protect data. 

Although a private blockchain kills the idea of decentralization and transparency, it boasts a few merits. Due to the fact that a private network is accessible for insiders only, it consumes much less energy, time and money to reach a consensus. Besides, it‚Äôs cheaper and faster. 

Wonder whether it‚Äôs possible to take the best from both technological solutions? A hybrid blockchain makes that possible.

## A hybrid blockchain: the golden middle

A hybrid blockchain combines the advantages of both public and private blockchain. In this case, network participants or a particular entity can decide which transactions can remain public, and which should be accessible for a small group of members only.

A hybrid blockchain makes every transaction private but verifiable by an immutable record, which is the peculiarity of a public blockchain. The every transaction is approved by the network, and there‚Äôs no need for a central entity or any intermediary to control operations. 

In a hybrid blockchain, everyone has equal rights to view and perform transactions, but the identity of transacting parties is not disclosed to the network participants. Some financial institutions also implement the KYC (Know Your Customer) in their hybrid blockchain: although it stays decentralized, secure and transparent, there are different levels of permission. 

A hybrid blockchain technology can be applied in different spheres: travel, energy, delivery, etc, but the biggest benefit can be reaped by businesses that need decentralization for financing, supply-chain, or procurement.  There are a few projects that help businesses implement a hybrid blockchain into their infrastructure, and one of them is [Precium](https://www.precium.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=first&amp;utm_campaign=cg).

[Precium](https://www.precium.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=first&amp;utm_campaign=cg) is a Korean project that leverages its proprietary Onyx chain ‚Äì a hybrid blockchain that uses a public blockchain to authorize hashing of a private block, and yet sustains the privacy of participants. While any person can view the Onyx chain‚Äôs public blocks, private blocks are accessible for particular users only. Onyx chain gets external information through Oracle technology, which makes it superb to a public blockchain that requires a multitude of nodes to validate smart contracts.

[Precium](https://www.precium.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=first&amp;utm_campaign=cg) gives any business the opportunity to implement a hybrid blockchain: it provides sets of codes for companies to construct their own smart contract. That allows for making transactions faster and cheaper without hurting clients‚Äô privacy and safety.

163,2018-11-21,GhibelMizzen,1,Smart contracts in real business: The future is here," The global financial community recognizes blockchain as one of the most groundbreaking technologies that are set to rock the boat of the world economy. Enterprises in all industries attempt to reap benefits from this technology to reach their specific goals, and one of the key blockchain‚Äôs advantages is smart contracts. 

## What is a smart contract?

To put it simply, smart contract is a piece of code that executes certain actions under certain conditions. For instance, when implemented in eCommerce, it can trigger a payment from the user‚Äôs wallet as soon as ordered items are shipped and this fact is fixed in the blockchain. 

Smart contracts have three key unbeatable advantages:

1. They eliminate intermediaries from transactions enabling P2P interaction. 
2. Smart contracts are much faster and totally eliminate the risk of human error ‚Äì they‚Äôre executed automatically.
3. It‚Äôs a great solution for the contractual relationships where trust is required. A properly written smart contract makes transactions transparent and fair.

## [Precium](https://www.precium.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=first&amp;utm_campaign=cg) brings smart contracts to real life

Practice shows that smart contracts make a day-and-night difference in performance and efficiency of business operations. For this reason, tech-savvy countries like China, South Korea and Japan encourage ICO creation and adoption of smart contracts in various industries. In traditional business, smart contracts facilitate communication and perform many other functions.

Precium is a good case in point: this project was established in South Korea in 2017. It is supported by major local and international partners, including Two AB, SBS, Naver, Swarovski, Kakao Talk, and Bit Asset. Precium platform offers a template of smart contract terms for users to create their own customized smart contracts and use them in peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions.

Here‚Äôs how it works.

Any company can become a Precium user and exploit its smart contract templates. It allows for developing the proprietary smart contract that‚Äôs tailored to specific business requirements. Smart contracts can serve for the whole gamut of tasks:

1. Automation of payments and transactions.
2. Delivery of items (smart contract will register the status of shipping and trigger corresponding actions).
3. Contractual relationships and legal issues (particularly useful for law firms). 
4. Voting during real-life meet-ups. 
5. Data security and access management in virtual infrastructure. 

Precium provides its proprietary Onyx Chain where all information related to smart contracts is stored. How is data obtained? The project uses Oracle technology to import all off-chain information on the Onyx blockchain. Therefore, customers are free to exploit different platforms and applications to manage their business ‚Äì they won‚Äôt need to make any drastic changes in their current digital infrastructure. 

Smart contract is a versatile means of data and fund management ‚Äì it automates business processes making them transparent and error-proof. Practice shows that any business can benefit from this technology: such projects as Precium make this utopian dream come true. "

166,2018-11-17,KiwiWithAHat,1,Investing Newbie - EFTS? Zacks? Fidelity?,"I'm fairly new to investing and young (only 20). I realize the importance of investing and I prefer to be stingy (or at least force myself not to spend by putting my savings into the market... don't worry not all of my savings haha).

&amp;#x200B;

My Uncle, a successful investor, strongly recommends I primarily stick to mutual funds and EFTs such as QQQ and a good index fund. He helped me get set up on Fidelity, so I'll be sticking with that platform. I've about $5600 that I've invested so far. Unfortunately I picked a really bad day to put 70% of my cash into the market (peak in October before the recent downward trend). First lesson learned - PATIENCE (I've now put the rest in as I believe the business cycle will increase again).

&amp;#x200B;

I have a one month free trial (I really don't trust paying over $1000 a year for probabilities that are somewhat inconsistent) with Zacks and I've enjoyed the service. Most of the investments I have are in Fidelity EFTs (500 Index, IT/Security, Horizons Life Sciences \[OUCH\], Healthcare Tech), and 30% in stocks (Target, AMD, Kohls, and JMP). I'm very interested in Blockchain and possibly waiting for a nice fund for that. I found out about these stocks soley through Zacks (and familiarity with AMDs stocks a few years back). However, I believe that there is so much information at my fingertips now that it doesn't really make sense to pay for a service like that. How can I learn/what free services/sources are available?

&amp;#x200B;

My goal with investing is to have 50% be money that grows longterm (10 - 40 years), and 50% be money that is shorter term that I can pull out when I move/buy a house OR reinvest (5 - 10 years). How can I learn more about investing, and how do I discover stocks/good funds? Good sources? How should I plan for the supposed incoming recession (inbound in 1 - 3 years). I believe that I COULD take the time to learn a lot of the analytics, but I despise analytics and believe investing in stocks is more strategized gambling and betting on probabilities. If you believe I should take the time to learn about scanning these detailed reports, then please convince me."

Good and bad, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

* *The insane ROI on coins going + 36 000% in a year with hundreds of millions in USD transacted daily*
* *The amounts of innocent people getting scammed who didn't know any better*
* *The people taking out loans and second mortages on their houses, just to lose it all in gambling on crypto currencies*

* *The benefits of using the open, auditable immutable distriburtued ledger technologies that blockchain has to offer*
* *This one you must've heard, ""only criminals, scammers and terrorists use cryptocurrencies""* 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to summarise, you have heard alot of bad things about it, but the is alot of good aswell. Most of what you have heard is true, there is alot of criminal activity, tax evasion, scams, market manipulation etc. going on, im not going to lie about it. But that is not at all what blockchain and crypto is about. There are several bad actors going around and tarnishing the whole space. Blockchain and crypto is a legit movement which aims to better and improve existing industries such as:

* *FinTech.*
*  *IoT.*
* *supplychain management.*
* *preventing fraud and high markups by middlemen,*
*  *providing actual sound money for people in developing countries where there is always a fear of hyper inflation of the local currency due to highly uncapable leaders. (look at venezuela, argentina, turkey, zimbabwe etc.)* 
* *providing verifyable identities to people without identities, can you imagine living without being to verify who you are?*
* *financial inclusion, providing banking services to people with no access to them*
* *tracking and verifying authenticity of a product / good / collectible*

These are just a set of examples what blockchain and crypto can and probably will improve on. Now, dont get me wrong. Currently many, if not most cryptocurrencies are actual scams and money grabs from innocent people tryng to get those incredible gains of 100x ROI, chasing pumps and losing their money.

The key when looking up and investing in cryptocurrencies is extensive research and analyzing of a company and its staff, being patient and not to ""FOMO"" (Fear Of Missing OUT) and finding these companies providing a solution to a problem or an actual upgrade to what the legacy system has to offer. Don't go throwing your money at something someone else recommended to you. Do your own research, it has to be extensive and thorough, otherwise you might just go to a roulet table, put it all on red and wish for the best. Most of the  companies runnig a crypto / blockchain don't even need it. They have no use of it and only try to ride the hype which the ""blockchain buzzword"" offers. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just as an example, im going to provide you info on a Canadian company called Adbank and im hoping to give you a different perspective on the crypto and blockchain industry. If you change your mind (assuming all you think about when you hear crypto is ""ponzi, scam and criminal activity"") and start allocating a samll % of your portfolio into crypto, I hope you keep in mind that it is very risky at all times and do some serious contemplating if it's actually a good idea to put some money into what ever it is you are thinking of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, about adbank, i'm going to provide you with some background on the online ad-industry, which Adbank is providing its services to. 

The online ad-industry is a place where ad-fraud is running rampant. The internet is riddled with bot traffic (any wehre form 40-60% of internet traffic is bots), advertisers lose 1/3 of their moeny to bots watching their ads and it's actually the second largest source of income for criminal organizations, second to none but illegal drugs. Can you imagine that?

There is a russian group of hackers, who make 3 000 000 USD on a daily basis due to them runnig a few bots. [Adweek actually released an article about this group, which you can read here.](https://www.adweek.com/digital/russian-ring-digital-ad-crooks-reportedly-making-over-3-million-day-175194/)

There is little or close to none transparency in the industry, which industry giants such as google and facebook have been sued several times for. Both advertisers and publishers are pretty helpes in these cases and there was no improvement in sight until blockchain. here are a few articles for youto read if you want to verify:

[https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/06/google-and-facebook-sued-over-failure-to-disclose-political-ad-spending/](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/06/google-and-facebook-sued-over-failure-to-disclose-political-ad-spending/)

[https://hackernoon.com/why-adtrader-is-suing-google-and-why-most-advertisers-might-never-get-that-chance-again-2bc3ee376d0c](https://hackernoon.com/why-adtrader-is-suing-google-and-why-most-advertisers-might-never-get-that-chance-again-2bc3ee376d0c)

&amp;#x200B;

The industry also has a problem with payment times, sometimes ranging between a week or two to motnhs.

Now that we have established some sort of understanding what problems the industry has, lets open up how blockchain can provide solutions to them. I'm not going to go into detail on how blockchain and smart contracts work, due to me not being tech savvy enough and it would probably double the length of this already long post. But i will shortly and very simply tel you what can be achieved.

Through blockchain technology all the transactions become transparent and auditable. What this means basically is that every advertiser can verify that their money is going to the right place and no where else. This kind of transparency has never been seen in this space. heres a quote from the SVP of customer experience at adweek when talking about piloting Adbanks tech:

 

&gt;*‚ÄúWe are excited to be experiencing the way blockchain is providing a new level of accountability and transparency in ad technology. Adbank is delivering on a concept that appeals to the entire marketing ecosystem‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand we look forward to seeing how the industry will evolve when it‚Äôs deployed at scale‚Äù*  
&gt;  
&gt;*David Saabye, SVP of Customer Experience @ Adweek*

&amp;#x200B;

Through smart contracts, the Adbank platform will be able to provide realtime payments for every ad watched, so that the transaction from advertiser to publisher happens in realtime when running an ad-campaign.

Adbank has developed an AI (which they have a patent pending on) which tracks every traqnsaction within their ecosystem and flags fraudulent activity so that a human can double check situation and ""follow the money"" so to say, if a transaction is deemed fraudulent, actions will be taken. Now remember, this is putting it very simplisticly, there is a set of different algorithms, code and procedures taking place in tracking the fraudulent activity. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all could just be so called ""fluff"" and have nothing backing it up. How do you verify that anything they say is true and not all just a big sham? It's not unheard of in the crypto space. 

There are articles and pressreleases by the parties involved, events that the company attends to and different statements from 3rd parties. Adbank has run pilot campaigns with the Austrian government body ANTO and RedBull, aswell as with adweek and flixxel. An article has been published on forbes about it, you can read about it [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ginaclarke/2018/09/25/the-viral-video-that-convinced-the-austrian-national-tourism-office-to-embrace-blockchain/#f9bf52c1b5ae). 

Adbank has attended the United Nations forums about blockchain and actually been awarded.

[https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-cso-kelsey-cole-receives-award-at-united-nations-on-international-peace-day-833a23417fbb](https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-cso-kelsey-cole-receives-award-at-united-nations-on-international-peace-day-833a23417fbb)

They have founded the blockchain research commitee at IAB (Interactive Advertisment Buerau), all the big players within the industry is apart of it. [https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-joins-interactive-advertising-bureau-iab-to-start-blockchain-committee-d85c51e58f96](https://medium.com/adbank-blog/adbank-joins-interactive-advertising-bureau-iab-to-start-blockchain-committee-d85c51e58f96)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to post about all of their achievments, but you can read more about them here, [in their medium blog.](https://medium.com/@adbank)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'ts these kinds of ""gems"" the more serious crypto investors are searching for, with a real usecase and a service to provide. The ones that follow all the regulations and are actually legit companies working to provide a solution to a problem. There is so much potential in this space and in a few years time, we will see that blockchain will actually provide some game changing services to different industries. I'ts up to the savvy investors to take advantage of the current situation regarding the uncertanty surrounding the space and make some life changing investments. Adbank's marketcap is currently at 2 000 000 USD which is comparable to the lower penny stocks. The risk / reward ratio on throwing in a few hundred to thousand bucks on a promising project like this is unheard of.

&amp;#x200B;

177,2018-11-02,daniilgor,1,Monaco As a Potential Crypto Haven: Will the Monaco International Blockchain Conference Provide the Answers?,"One of the biggest issues that the investors in the domain of blockchain and related technologies face in multiple ways is the regulatory uncertainty.

The first manifestation of this problem lies in the attempts by many regulators to fit the novelties presented by the domain into the old regulatory straitjacket. One of the most important examples is the treatment of the digital assets by the US SEC. In this approach, essentially any asset whose value depends on the efforts of an identifiable group of people (even ETH at the moment of its issuance) becomes a security.

At the same time, some or even all competent authorities leave certain aspects of the blockchain and related technologies without any clear official interpretation. For instance, almost nowhere in the world are blockchain ledgers recognized as a legitimate source of legal evidence, despite the fact that they may well in many cases be more reliable than the old ways of documenting things. Among other things, this makes it challenging to prove the provenance of certain important transactions, for instance for the purpose of establishing the initial acquisition value of digital assets.

Another major hurdle created mostly by the anti-money laundering regulation concerns the capacity of blockchain-related projects to forge banking relationships. Most banks appear to be so afraid of the potential sanctions that they prefer to avoid dealing with blockchain-related projects as much as possible. The case that best illustrates this is the effective forcing of the cryptocurrency-based prepaid card providers like Xapo and BitPay to leave the European market in the beginning of this year.

Finally, in many countries, digital asset holders have little clarity with respect to the treatment of their gains or losses from the tax perspective. This may well drive away many potential investors, especially those without an extremely high tolerance for risk, probably leaving the cryptocurrency investment space dominated by early adopters and high-risk speculators, which does not necessarily make for well-functioning crypto asset markets.

The difficulties caused by the regulatory uncertainty of course do not mean that the regulators would help if they chose the other extreme, namely, a detailed stifling blockchain-specific set of rules. The development of the world wide web should serve as an inspiration here as it took place in the absence of either of those extremes.

Realistically, though, it is hard to expect major countries‚Äô governments to show leadership as far as blockchain regulation is concerned. They tend to either face other problems that are perceived to be much more pressing politically or they tend to place too much emphasis on objectives (such as maximizing tax receipts, curbing drug trade, maintaining tight control over the money supply and so on) that, if pursued too vigorously, are incompatible with creating optimal conditions for open experimentation in the blockchain space.

On the other hand, relatively small, more or less developed countries like Switzerland, Malta and Mauritius, have already positioned themselves far ahead of the larger counterparts in this respect. Such countries, unsurprisingly, tend to be the first playgrounds for innovative practices, especially in finance-related domains.

However, the position of any individual small crypto haven may change at any moment because of the external pressure by countries that are important to them from the economic or strategic standpoint, economic difficulties, political upheavals and other factors. That is why, it is arguably crucial for the ultimate success of the blockchain space as a whole for it to be able to potentially rely on a range of crypto havens to choose from.

This is where the potential position of Monaco comes in. The Principality has so far been largely flying under the radar compared to, for instance, Malta or Switzerland in terms of its legal approach to the blockchain but in January this year its elected National Council actually approved Bill 237 specifically devoted to the regulation of the blockchain space. (text in French). Amazingly, no major news outlet, crypto-focused or otherwise, has covered this major development.

Although there does not seem to have been any updates on the developments around this bill, according to the analysis by Mark Lipskier, at least on paper, it appears to be very promising because of its generalist approach [1], perhaps, so far without precedent anywhere else. Interestingly, the aforementioned AMB is supposed to be a ‚Äúbody of private law‚Äù, and during three years it will be uniquely responsible for blockchain regulation, as well as for overseeing 13 development programs.

During the aforementioned 3-year experimentation period, Article 7 of the bill provides that the enterprises interested in collaborating with the principality in developing solutions based on blockchains, smart contracts, algorithmic enterprises and cryptocurrencies will receive material assistance, as well as a guarantee of no hindrances from the regulatory perspective.

The bill also spells out the definitions of important terms such as blockchains, smart contracts, algorithmic enterprises [2] and cryptocurrencies, and recognizes blockchain technology-enabled ledgers as a form of legally binding document creation facilitating the usage of ledger contents in all kinds of legal contexts.

Despite its great promise, however, the passed bill in itself contains only very general terms and probably cannot be applied to actual cases directly, especially in a continental law jurisdiction such as Monaco. Thus, the ultimate effect of the bill will depend on the further regulatory actions will be promptly taken to substantiate its provisions. It also needs to be clarified what kind of material assistance blockchain-related enterprises can apply for, in what manner, and what exactly the no regulatory hindrance guarantee will imply in practice.

This is why the upcoming Monaco International Blockchain conference on November 29‚Äì30 may be of particular interest, especially the session devoted to regulation. One of the speakers during that session will be the founder of the Word of Blockchains Monaco Thierry Poyet, the author of the aforementioned bill. One has to hope that he will cover the developments around the blockchain law, and I also hope to be able to discuss with him personally in more detail or even arrange an interview, as I am planning to attend the conference.

In any case, stay tuned for my post-conference update which I will definitely provide here.

[1] With the caveat that I so far only managed to access the text of the bill and not the adopted law. It is, however, unlikely, that the adopted law differs from the draft in major respects.

[2] This term appears to refer to decentralized autonomous organizations but it is not wholly clear whether it is limited just to them."

184,2018-12-17,SmoresPies,1,I want to re-evaluate my portfolio. How do I commit to cut losses?,"My portfolio is riddled with long shots that didn't work out, some that did and just laced with an overall misguided direction that relied heavily on luck or greed. I want to become more focused and concise and try to learn from my mistakes. 

I have no problem liquidating the profitable ones, it's the steep blemishes I have a hard time committing to. Overall, if I cut EVERYTHING I'd come out with a 10% gain over 5+ years. Abysmal(was at 35% before the last month or so). Given my new direction, am I better off just cutting my losses and moving forward? or do I leave them as reminders for where I want to go from here? 

Also, if it helps, right now my portfolio is *very* risky, a lot of decisions were made off whims or impulses dating back to when I was 21-22 and very naive, probably still am but... some plays in oil from a few years ago when the industry tanked, broke even. Most in marijuana for years that I held throughout the bubble, foolish. AMD off the crypto hype(came out ahead just seems rather stagnant lately), along with various other blockchain related stocks that truly decimated me(smallish plays to begin with, just staring at -90% whenever I log in). And now since I'm beginning my journey into the 30s, from these ashes, I hope to sprout a growth oriented dividend portfolio with maybe 1-2 moves playing heavily into volatility. 

Any help is much appreciated, thanks!"

This nice initiative allows employees to receive tokens for participation in innovative projects and sharing ideas. Tokens earned by company personnel can then be spent on a large number of ""experiences"". For example, you can buy a poker game with the vice president of PayPal, drink coffee in the company of CFO John Rainey, or practice your martial arts with CEO Dan Schulman. One of the rewards even allows you to ""borrow"" one day the dog of one of the managers!"
