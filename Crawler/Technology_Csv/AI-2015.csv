0,2015-02-25,AiresGRC,1,An Investment Tool That Uses AI to Simulate Markets and Predict Their Next Move,"http://bit.ly/1AJYT9P

Nowadays investing in the stock market seems to be all about competing over pennies at sub-millisecond speed, requiring huge upfront investments in low-latency technology, in what is known as High-Frequency Trading. At the other end of the extreme, ordinary people are using mobile investing apps to simply automatically invest small amounts in passive index funds. Little attention however is going to approaches that actually aim to predict market movements by taking advantage of fundamental market inefficiencies. This is surprising, given todayâ€™s advances in artificial intelligence, big data and available computing power.

One such attempt though is made by Altreva, a company that specializes in financial time series forecasting and market modeling. Their Adaptive Modeler software uses evolutionary computing and simulation technology to create evolving market models that predict market movements.

What are your thoughts on this topic?"
1,2015-03-11,cygtfm,17,Is Google innovative? Should its track record inspire confidence in a lay investor?,"Premise: Google is innovative. 

Subtext: investing in innovation will lead to outsized rewards in the future.

Supporting arguments: driverless cars, Google Fiber?, dominant mobile market share...

Counterpoints: 
1. Driverless cars - the Wiki page for driverless cars says institutions like CMU and Mercedes Benz have been working in this space for decades. Google is merely a very visible proponent of such cars.

2. Google Fiber: hardly innovative. Wireless providers like VZ have fiber optics. Maybe Google enjoys a halo because companies like VZ have not been sufficiently customer friendly. It takes one visionary CEO to realize the goldmine they are sitting on. 

3. Android: this product is the opposite of innovative. In fact, when the iPhone was launched in 2007, the founder of Android took his product back to the drawing board because he felt that the iPhone had fundamentally changed the entire mobile phone market. Ever since, Android has been playing catch up. They introduced NFC but no one cared. Apple Pay comes out and immediately eats Google Wallet's lunch. Now, once again, Google is trying to stay relevant in the mobile payments market by paying attention to Google Wallet.

4. Wearables: Google Glass flopped. On the contrary, Microsoft's Band came out to rave reviews. 

Google isn't competitive in social, nor in e-commerce, not in mass Internet, not in moonshots like driverless cars - a tesla or Apple driverless car will likely be more interesting than a Google driverless car, not in wearables. Question is, why is Google even treated like a long term investment by this sub?

Even in search, their marketshare will be eroded by the likes of FB's own search engine and AI like Watson. I test drove Yahoo's search on my iPhone after Apple switched to it from Bing - after the first week, I barely notice the difference in search result quality.

So, why Google? "

The reason for my question is that I am currently a small business consultant on the Retirement Plan desk but am eyeing a move to a firm that specializes in AI and am curious about the viability of the business. Any help is appreciated.
3,2015-05-23,goingToInvest,0,Started a $500 account with Etrade. Help me break inertia and start investing,"I've been meaning to do this for a while, so I set aside $500 for individual stock investing. Its been 48 hours since the funds are available for investing, but I don't know which stock(s) to start investing in. Done fair amount of reading about the whole process and assessment of companies, but still. I'm a tech guy who really understands how technology works, whats appealing, and whats not. Here are a few categories that I think are trendy (ranking is random so don't judge me by putting 3D printing as #1 :)  )

1) 3D printing
2) AI
3) MDM
4) SDN
5) Quantum computing
6) Mobile H/W. Companies like Qualcom
7) Virtualization (VMware and Citrix,.. etc.)
8) Internet of Things
9) Battery Technology
10) Social Media (Twitter, Facebook,..etc.)

Thanks a bunch!!

4,2015-05-02,nerdhard,0,Which public companies will benefit from AI and Immortality?,"For the next decades, I see 2 trends being the most funfamental:
1. Computers reaching and surpassing human intelligence in all areas.
2. Human immortality. Either by manipulation of the DNA or by continously replacing/repairing parts of the human body.
How could this be incorporated in a stock market portfolio?"
5,2015-06-03,greatm31,1,Can Google execute?,"They invest BILLIONS into R&amp;D but what successful product have they made substantial **money** on besides search and gmail? Sure they have amazing talent and invent incredible technology, pushing the boundaries on wearable computing and image recognition and tons of other AI tech, but where are the products? Even when they have something nearly consumer ready (Google Glass) they have insufficient vision to execute. Plus they have countless other products that they gave half-hearted efforts before letting them die.

Why should we believe that they will make any money from all their research dollars? Kind of reminds me of MSFT, who also has built amazing tech that never got to a product, but at least Microsoft *sells* their software!
