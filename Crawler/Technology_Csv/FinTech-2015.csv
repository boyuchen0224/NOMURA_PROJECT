I didn't agree and I'm sharing it anyway, I thought it is sound advice but somewhat obvious for advanced investors on the platforms, excellent for [very new P2P investors](http://thelendingmag.com/peer-to-peer-lending/) or people that don't know much about what P2P lending is in general. 


I'm excited about the future of P2P lending, the major financial institutions are jumping on board in both the US and UK, fintech is a major game changer and great way to diversify the portfolio.

10,2015-07-30,investwithup,1,2015 is crowdfundings watershed year,"""When new industries are born they either die quickly, snuffled out by growing pains, or they burst into the scene with furious pace.""
The more innovative an idea, the harder it can be to find real adoption. First you need to educate, build within rules, which were often not designed for you and lastly wait for punters to catch on/up and adopt. Crowdfunding is in the middle of this exact process, transitioning from being a clever idea, into a real mechanism for individuals and businesses to raise money. So here are the top 3 reasons why 2015 is proving crowdfunding’s watershed point.

1. UK government support is awesome

Political support for the alternative finance sector has been enduring and constant. The chancellor George Osborne seems super-keen to bring alternative finance into the mainstream. With his post-election Budget, the announcement of the Innovative Finance ISA demonstrates this desire admirably. In fact, with the UK discovering a world-leading niche with the fintech sector, support for new-fangled tech and finance sectors is likely to continue to grow, even potentially through direct government investment. Further tax incentives, changes in the way banks treat failed loan application and greater awareness at the very top, will ensure continued strength in the already rapidly growing industry.

2. The Innovative Finance ISA is a BIG deal

The government recently announced the launch of the Innovative Finance ISA, called by the industry the IFISA, or the far more colloquial crowdISA as we at investUP call it. This will be based on all investment types of crowdfunding (so lending to people, businesses and buying shares). The new ISA will not sit under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). It also recognises that crowdfunding is a set of distinct asset classes, with a unique risk profile. The massiveness of this one really must not be understated. The crowdISA will allow consumers to lend or invest up to £15,240 a year tax free, via either individual crowdfunding sites, or across lots of them, to individuals and businesses. Crowdfunding will suddenly have access to a slice of the £50bn a year of retail money, which goes into the ISA pot. By all accounts this will be a huge transformation within the crowdfunding world, as well as signalling that crowdfunding is going mainstream. Public awareness of crowdfunding will be transformed due to this change. Exciting.

3. Global crowdfunding is continuing to grow massively

Whilst the UK is the most advanced western crowdfunding marketplace, worldwide crowdfunding is catching up. Relatively the US is starting to really pick up the pace. With Nesta.org in Nov 2014 suggested that the 2015 alternative finance market in the UK alone would reach £4.4bn, the global figures are predicted by Massolution to double as well to $34.4bn. The EU is also pushing new boundaries, with crowdfunding developing, although this is still in its infancy. 

What does the future hold for crowdfunding?

Crowdfunding is undergoing huge growth. We at UP expect this to start levelling off by 2020. By this point crowdfunding will be mainstream, with alternative finance really being anything but alternative. As investors understand better the risk profile of the industry, so to will the FCA. Having both parties better understand the losses as well as potential gains one can make will only strengthen the sector. Sites which offer greater portfolio diversification with tools to support this will win. Millennial adoption of the alternative finance mechanisms will ensure that they become the majority retail user. By 2020 crowdfunding will be fully grown UP. #theonlywayisUP"
11,2015-07-21,idealinvestisseur,1,Investir sur Internet : le e-investissement est-il bien raisonnable ?,"Internet a bouleversé les modes de consommation et le e-commerce est entré dans les mœurs : près de 60% des français ont déjà réalisé un achat en ligne (étude FEVAD 2014). Les « Fintech », ces sociétés repensant les services financiers à l’appui des nouvelles technologies, permettent aujourd’hui d’investir directement sur Internet. Alors se pose la même question que pour le e-commerce au début des années 2000 : investir sur Internet, est-ce bien raisonnable ?"
12,2015-09-17,InsaneAngler,2,"Just watched Drugs Inc. ""The Real Wolves of Wallstreet"". Is Wallstreet REALLY all drug fueled, ultra high stress chaos?","The show basically portrayed cocaine, heroin and Adderall abuse as being at near epidemic proportions for wall-streeters. Some even went on to say that they wouldn't be able to make it in the industry without it, and that they are forced to stay up day and night to get an edge-- to stay productive or be viewed as worthless. 

As someone who has been in the financial industry down here in Baltimore, I don't see any of this kind of stuff  happening. Then again, the people I work with are probably making a tier below in money to the JP / GS traders. Honestly? I'm not about that life, and I'm concerned that if I continue in Fintech that I will run into this at some point.

Anyone have thoughts on this?

16,2015-12-15,eivindab,27,"Fingerprint Cards. (STO: FING-B) - Biometry, extreme growth and high profitability","I thought I’d write a short intro to a very exciting Swedish company called Fingerprint Cards (STO: FING-B, hereafter FPC). I bet a lot of people here have heard about them (and indeed maybe own shares). Some will probably know it a lot better than I do, but this is a start. Even though it’s a small company (market cap of slightly more than $3.5 billion), it’s one of the most traded stocks in Europe. I’m from Norway, and the FPC has a higher trade volume on an average day than the entire stock exchange in Norway.

So, what do they do? They make fingerprint scanners for smartphones, tablets and soon to be smartcards.

**Reasons for reading on:**  

- It’s the fastest growing company in Europe (words of the CEO a couple of days ago).  
- I mean it’s still a good buy even though it’s up 1300% so far this year.  
- They have a highly scalable business model.  
- They have, seemingly, the best technology.  

**History and competition**  
18 years ago there were a couple of players in the fingerprint business. You had the Americans Authentec and Synaptics and FPC. A few more players have entered the scene later on. Chinese Goodix is the most notable of them now, as well as a couple of Norwegian companies (Idex and Next Biometrics). Nothing really happened before Authentec was bought by Apple and released the Iphone 5s with touch id. Suddenly everyone wanted a fingerprint scanner on their phone. The breakthrough for FPC was when Huawei launched their Mate 7 in 2014 with a sensor from FPC. So what about Synaptics? They deliver the sensors for all Samsung-phones.

**Financials**  
Revenue (in SEK (divide by 8,5 to get USD)):
2012: 12 million  
2013: 94 million  
2014: 233 million  
2015: 2.8 billion (estimated)  
2016: 7.5 billion (middle range of guided 6.5-8.5 last week).  
2017: ?  

They say their gross margin will be roughly the same as the second half of 2015 which has been 45%(!). With 22% tax, 550m in Opex (roughly) we’re looking at a positive cash flow of over 2 billion sek next year. If the middle range of the guided will come through. This year though, they have increased their guiding 4 or 5 times because of the explosive market. I think they are careful for 2016. A guiding of 6.5 billion leaves almost no market growth (q over q) as Q4 2015 will have a revenue of about 1.3billion alone and Q1 should be around 1.4-1.5 billion.

**Customers**  
FPC stated that their goal was to have 50% of the addressable market of fingerprint sensor market for smartphones in 2014. In practice they probably have 85-90%. They are sweeping the floor with the competition.

9 out of the 10 biggest smartphone players in China are customers of FPC. 42 phones have launched in China with FPC to date. Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Oppo, Coolpad, Vivo, Gionee, Meizu and a lot of smaller all have phones with FPC technology.

The biggest market is still outside of China for FPC. Obviously Huawei (who really are all in and 100m phone sales in 2016 should net FPC 2.4 billion in revenue alone) is the biggest. Google is the

In 2015 53 smarthphones/tablets with FPC have been launched with 24 OEMs. 2 phones were launched in 2014.

**Brands outside of China:**  
LG
Sony
Google (the new Nexus phones by LG and Huawei). Google also included FPC in the work with Android M.
Microsoft (Surface 4 pro)
Blu
Nextbit Robin (Kickstarter project)

**The competition and their phones:**  
Synaptics: They have Samsung, and are struggling. Some think that Samsung will come to FPC. That would be HUGE. They also have Sharp.
Apple: Only inhouse
Next Biometrics: No phones to date
Idex: No phones to date
Goodix: They won TCL (top 10 in China, but probably can’t sell it outside of China because of patent issues). Goodix previously had Meizu which FPC now has.

A lot of smaller niche phones have been released as well with unknown sensor producer.

**Growing market**  
The fingerprint sensor penetration (the number of phones with a sensor that is released of the total amount) is slightly above 30% for 2015. About 100m sensors this yearFPC says that 2016 the number will be a bit more than 50% (about 300m will be FPCs share probably). This will continue to increase until 100% of the phones are released with a sensor (2020ish).

**New business opportunities**  
Smartcards is coming soon to try to stop the bleeding of customers from credit cards to smartphone payment systems. It’s in development and starting commercialization in 2016. In 2018 the smartcard market, according to FPC, will be as big as the smartphone market in 2016 (7,5 billion more for FPC?). Who has the technology for smartcards? So far, only FPC who is leading this together with Zwipe and Mastercard plus some unknown fintech companies.

Check out Kickstarter and see how many new projects feature fingerprint sensors. They are coming everywhere. Smart locks for bikes. Smart homes. Internet of things. Medical equipment. Guns. Passports. Automotive industry. This is just the beginning of this mega trend.

**The Stock**  
The stock is a WILD ride. From the low of 30ish this year it’s at 494 now. However, 7 trading days ago it closed at 675 before the guiding of 2016. Since it has dropped like a stone, was down to 421 today. 

Now, what is a fair valuation of a company that grows 1000% from 2014 to 2015 and looking at 200% 2015-2016? Current valuation gives a forward P/E of around 10 if they hit the top of the guiding. I personally believe they will top their guided range. Based on 2015 numbers they are trading at a P/E of 37,5 (but bear in mind that the revenue for Q1-Q3 have been 140m - 460m - 960m and Q4 is looking at 1300m). 

**Outlook:**  
5% of the stock (about 3 million shares) is shorted which also has caused the downfall last week. They might have to close the short prior to 21st of December (FPC enters Eurostoxx 600 index) or 4th of January (enters the OMX30 index). A few million shares will be bought by index funds of the total of 64 million shares.

**Technology**  
I advice to take a look at the presentation linked below for the technology.

- They have the lowest power consumption (a must for smart cards)
- It’s safe (nothing is stored on the phone).
- It’s the only company that can satisfy Google’s demand for false rejection/acceptance rate).
- It’s hardware so it’s insanely hard to copy and they have a developed the sensors for 18 years.
- They have a very broad portfolio of sensors.

**Risks**  
It’s a technology stock after all. Competition is a risk, but still the competition is nowhere to be seen. Qualcomm might come with an ultrasonic sensor in 2016 (supposed to be 2015, but we’ll see). Price pressure might come up. They say though that they are the cheapest already at about $3 per sensor (and they sell 1 million per day). For 2016 it’s estimated that the price will go down to $2.75. But, the sensors are also getting smaller (look at the Sony Xperia for example, the side sensor is very small, being less material needed and therefore higher margins).

**My two cents:**  
Tech is fun. I'm not an expert. I came in late to this stock as I was careful, I wasn't convinced until they raised the guidance for the third time this year). This is a megatrend that is taking off. FPC is leading it. The stock might not be dirt cheap now, but there is certainly a potential here (maybe not 10x in the short term anymore), but I’ll be very surprised if it doesn’t double in the next 12 months. It’s not a stock for the faint hearted. It’s extremely volatile, but hopefully it will calm down when it enters the index in Sweden and the tick size will go down considerably (meaning more robots, less daytraders) over new years.
