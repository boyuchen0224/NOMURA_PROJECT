From the article:

Health care became GV’s largest investment category in 2014, topping consumer, data and artificial intelligence, enterprise and robotics. In 2013, only 6 percent of GV’s investments were in health care. That jumped to 34 percent in 2014 and 31 percent in 2015, and Maris may expand his team of five partners who cover the industry this year.

...

“Often, the ones that are most controversial -- Uber, Foundation -- have the most spectacular outcomes, good or bad,” Maris said. “We are looking for spectacular outcomes. The most you can lose is all of your money.” The gains can be far larger, he said.

1,2016-02-10,Youted,1,Did the feds just pave a legal path for self-driving cars?,"While the letter is nether a formal policy ruling nor a recommendation, its tone suggests the agency is open to considering whether an artificial-intelligence system can be legally considered a driver.


In the letter, the NHTSA said that as “foundational starting point,” it “will interpret ‘driver’ in the context of Google’s described motor vehicle design as referring to the (self-driving system), and not to any of the vehicle occupants.”

“We agree with Google its (self-driving car) will not have a ‘driver’ in the traditional sense that vehicles have had drivers during the last more than one hundred years,” the NHTSA said. “If no human occupant of the vehicle can actually drive the vehicle, it is more reasonable to identify the driver as whatever (as opposed to whoever) is doing the driving.”

That possible interpretation of “driver” could have major implications in California, where Google has been testing autonomous cars for years, and which in December released draft rules that call for driverless cars, to, ironically enough, have a licensed driver. Those proposals caused dismay among driverless-car proponents; on Tuesday, a number of tech industry groups called on the state to rethink the driver requirement, saying it “misses the point” of the technology.

The NHTSA letter asks Google to answer a number of questions certifying the safety of its systems, and while numerous legal hurdles remain, the door to autonomous driving may have been pushed open.

6,2016-06-15,the_mighty_mango,0,Short Artificial Intelligence,"I am only talking about deep AI. However, things such as driverless cars and predicting the weather are inevitable in the near future. 

Any company that says they're going to make a robot that talks and can interact with human beings. Short. It's all bullshit. Remember the human genome project in the early 2000s? Billions were spent on understanding our genes and we got nothing. Sure you can predict eye color but you can only predict height with a 5% chance, strictly using genes. If I simply look at someone I can predict their children will be of similar height by 80%. Genes don't predict anything useful. That means we are far from understanding ourselves, let alone consciousness. Therefore we can't create anything we don't understand. 

Short any company that says they can. They're spending money on bullshit to make them look appealing. 

Tdlr; minimal AI is going to happen. But an AI with consciousness is going to take centuries to develop."

8,2016-09-21,tsarwalkedintoabar,15,Best ways for a regular person to invest in emerging technologies?,"I'd like to invest a small portion of my investment savings in emerging technologies: autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and internet of things. However, I don't want to buy stock in individual companies. I don't have the cash to buy multiple shares in 30+ companies, and I don't want to devote the time to constantly rearranging my portfolio as these rapidly-changing fields evolve. Though Vanguard is usually my go-to for investing, I'm not in love with their Information Technology fund: it's more weighted toward traditional IT companies than companies in the emerging fields mentioned above. Does anyone have recommendations for funds that might be better fits for these emerging technologies? And bigger picture, is there an efficient way to find funds based on interests? "
9,2016-09-19,erichisalurker,103,NVDA DD feel free to critique,"Nvidia’s foundational revenue stream is in its gaming-oriented PC GPU products.  Despite diversification into other market segments, this product division remains the largest revenue-generator for Nvidia. Over the last six quarters, gaming-related products have accounted for more than 50% of sales revenue for the company. However, this relative share of revenue has declined as Nvidia has expanded into other product areas. Since their Q1 2016 report (4-26-2015), revenue streams from Datacenter and Automotive products have increased by 71.6% and 54.55% respectively. Nvidia also generates a significant portion of its revenues from Professional Visualization and OEM &amp; IP products as well. Combined, these segments represent roughly 25% of Nvidia’s revenue. It is worth noting that over the last six quarters the revenue generated from OEM &amp; IP products has declined 25.22% while the revenue from Professional Visualization products has increased by 18.2%


Regionally, Nvidia still derives most of its revenue from the Asia Pacific markets. In Q2 2017 (7-31-2016), revenue in the Asia Pacific region accounted for 66.67% of overall revenue. This is compared to 14.42% from the US, 11.69% from Europe, and 7.21% from Other Americas. There has been stable revenue growth from every region over the last six quarters, keeping in line with the growth in overall revenue. The largest regional growth can be seen in the Asia Pacific and United States regions, indicating improving consumer demand in both of these areas.


Having recognized the declines in relative revenue generation from video game segments, Nvidia has shifted their focus moving forward to larger-scale, more innovative market segments. At Nvidia’s GTC China 2017 presentation, CEO Jen-Hsun Huang highlighted the massive impact that deep learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have on the world in the coming years. Nvidia seeks to push the boundaries of AI and deep learning technologies, and their first step is with their new GPU architecture, Pascal. Nvidia’s latest line of GPUs for both consumer and commercial use have been hailed as the best performing processors on the market. Furthermore, during the Q2 2017 earnings call, Huang reiterated his belief that deep learning is going to be the company’s most significant growth driver moving forward. Nvidia has very recently procured a contract with Chinese web company Baidu to develop AI platforms for their self-driving cars, adding their name to a client list which already includes industry leaders such as Tesla and BMW. A recent Bank of America forecast suggested that the deep learning and AI market could reach $153 billion by 2020, and Nvidia already has a strong position in the industry. 
	

Nvidia has very strong fundamentals currently. Over the last seven years, Nvidia has reported positive revenue and net income. Both of these metrics have seen substantial growth as costs have been reduced and profit margins have improved. Since 2010 both the total assets and total capital available have nearly doubled to $7370 million and $4580 million respectively. Nvidia has also seen substantial improvements in its ROA, ROC, and ROE. As of FY2016 reporting, ROA is 10.59%, ROC is 17.04%, and ROE is 17.46%. It is estimated that in FY2017, Nvidia will see revenue of $6098 million (12.12% increase from FY2016), net income of $1381.4 million (41.8% increase), and an EPS of $2.30 (67.9% increase). 
	

Nvidia’s TTM P/E ratio is currently sitting at 38.28 compared to an industry average of 15.2 and has a P/BV ratio of 7.51 compared to an industry average of 2.7. Normally these may indicate that the stock is overvalued, however Nvidia is seemingly at the forefront of a huge growth phase in an emerging industry and it appears that the market has priced this future growth in. In the coming months we should see a reduction in the P/E ratio due to higher EPS levels. As of their latest reporting, Nvidia has a current ratio of 2.56. This shows a lot fundamental strength for Nvidia to meet and short-term liabilities. Nvidia’s FY2016 profit margin was 15.58%, and impressive number alongside an equally impressive ROE of 17.46%. 
	

Given current fundamentals, Nvidia will be able to see a growth rate of 11.1%. This number is based on an equally-weighted average between the company’s Long-Run Growth Rate (10.90%) as shown on the company’s Bloomberg Terminal page and the Sustainable Growth Rate (11.28%) derived from the following formula: (ROE*b)/[1-(ROE*b)] where ROE is the company’s return on equity for the previous fiscal year and b is the retention ratio for the company. Nvidia’s current WACC is 12.5%, which is used as a benchmark for required return. Based on these two values and Nvidia’s returns over the last six years, Nvidia has an implied value of $46,827.67 million when using an earnings power valuation model. With 535 million shares outstanding, this implies a stock price of $87.52 per share. At the closing price of $62.84 on Sept. 16, there is a margin of safety of 28%. 
	

In spite of the huge returns Nvidia has already seen this year, I believe that it still has huge upside potential and would be a fantastic long-term buy. Nvidia’s upcoming product lines and revenue streams have positioned them positioned the company to be at the forefront of a growing deep learning and AI industry. Automation and self-learning software are becoming a larger part of our lives every day and Nvidia is creating the tools necessary to meet these new computational demands."
10,2016-11-17,BenjaminBoyle,1,Artificial Intelligence Based Trading Signals,"Hi All

Myself and 4 others are building Artificial Intelligence based trading signals and I just wanted to check with people here to see if you would buy into it once we have it up and running and how much would you be willing to pay a month to access the software (obviously understanding the signals have a decent level of accuracy).

We are just doing it for FOREX right now but we have a great long term strategy also. "
