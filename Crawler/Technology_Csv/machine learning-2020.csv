1) it has direct  relationships with 900m or 15% of the world's wealthiest consumers;

2)  its successful transition from a product-based company to an ecosystem  company means its relationship with users is becoming increasingly sticky and a product-based company (e.g. Samsung) can no longer  disrupt AAPL; only another ecosystem company (e.g. Google) could  compete;

3) AAPL's increasingly recurring-revenue business model is  driving its valuation multiple expansion;

4) AAPL has the best data for machine learning and AI to drive long-term data network effects,  because its closed ecosystem greatly limits fraud;

5) its enormous net cash position provides the flexibility to invest strategically and  return of capital."

I'm quite experienced in applied mathematics and computer science and have always been curious about trading. Would anyone happen to have an interesting idea for how I could apply my skillset in investing?

So far I've managed to come up with the following ideas:

\- A model that could estimate the sentiment of a security based on various internet sources (news, twitter, reddit and so forth). I'm however aware that many such models exist, but maybe you guys could suggest a unqiue take on the idea that could be useful to you?

\- A model that could read quarterly reports VERY quickly and figure out whether the reports live up to market expectations. Such a model could perhaps be deployed to trade in the nightly markets such that trades can be made the second the reports are published.

What do you guys think? Any ideas?"
5,2020-02-07,Thehamii,1,NVDA vs AMD,"Hi all,

Currently trying to pick between these 2 and having done my own research wanted to throw it out to this sub to see what I’ve missed.

Coming at this pretty much purely from a cloud gaming view which will dominate gaming in the future.

AMD: Also in the CPU market and are making major in roads here, and will likely grow market share in years to come. Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu’s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so.

NVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably. Not sure what NVDA would then do in this space, especially since cloud gaming may dislodge their GPU sales in consumer devices.

Leaning towards AMD at the moment but would welcome any thoughts."
6,2020-02-01,marketforecast1,1,Experiment: Investing in Future Technologies,"**Experiment: Investing in Future Technologies** 

I like to earn money on investments, and I also love modern technology.

I decided to conduct an experiment: make a list of potential technologies of the future and invest part of my capital in them. There are 14 industries on this list. Keeping track of this number and trying to guess in each one or more potential leaders is quite difficult.

As a result, I decided it was safer to contact not with specific companies, but with ETFs – funds that invest immediately in the industry or some set of companies. As a result, I opened an account with Interactive Brokers and started choosing funds.

&gt;***What kind of ETF and Interactive Brokers, let me just invest in the creation of robocopes***  
*We already wrote about what ETFs are and how they work – if you are in the know, you can skip this paragraph. In short: An ETF is a fund that includes a specific set of securities. When you buy an ETF stock, you invest immediately in all the companies in its portfolio. This is convenient because the threshold for entering the ETF is much lower than if you had to buy shares of each company in this fund. For convenience, you have to pay a commission that covers the costs of the fund.*  
*And Interactive Brokers is an American broker who opens accounts with clients from different countries. Such an account is one of the ways to buy stocks and ETFs on the American stock exchange.*

## How did I choose funds and how much did I invest

I must say right away that in each industry, I eventually allocated one ETF and invested $ 1000 in it. A total of 14 funds and $ 14,000.

When choosing a fund, I was guided by the following criteria:

1. Specialization of the fund on a specific technology, and not on a wide range.
2. Methodology for the selection of issuers.
3. Liquidity.
4. Adequate spread with which you can buy paper.
5. The size of the service fee.
6. Launch date.
7. The presence of competitors.
8. Historical quotes.

In each section, I give illustrations of quotes and geography – from them you can understand the historical profitability of the fund, the effectiveness of the stock selection methodology and how well the fund is diversified: ideally, it should track companies around the world, and not just in the United States.

Many eggs, many baskets. How exchange funds work  
At the end of the article will be an interactive table with all selected funds. It shows what is happening now with my portfolio.

## Fund 1 – Drones

Goldman Sachs predicts that [by 2020, the cost of drones in the world will exceed $ 100 billion](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/technology-driving-innovation/drones/). Drones are used everywhere:

1. Military – for reconnaissance and military operations.
2. Consumers are photographers, videographers and just lovers of toys.
3. Law enforcement agencies – for surveillance and patrolling.
4. E-Commerce – Amazon Already Delivers Drones Purchases in the UK
5. Oil and gas sector – for monitoring pipelines.
6. Construction – for maintenance, surveying, mapping.
7. Government agencies for rescue missions.
8. Agriculture – for soil analysis, crop health assessment, pesticide spraying, seed planting and field irrigation throughout the crop cycle.

Now in the drone industry you can invest with only one narrow-profile fund – ETFMG Drone Economy Strategy, [ticker IFLY](https://www.etf.com/IFLY). The fund tracks its own stock index of companies around the world – US companies account for only 58.67% of the portfolio. All index companies are associated with the unmanned aerial vehicle industry, including manufacturers and suppliers. IFLY launched in March 2016, the fund takes a commission of 0.75% for the management.

## Fund 2 – Artificial Intelligence

This sector includes developments in machine learning, neural networks, robotics, face and speech recognition. Thanks to neural networks, the on-board computer of self-driving vehicles can distinguish a pedestrian from other objects on the highway.

7,2020-03-16,tttmmmsss,1,Crisis Means a New Business Era | WSJ Op-ed,"&gt;**Crisis Means a New Business Era**

&gt;*Cheap energy, a shift from China and remote work will all shape the long-term economy.*


&gt;The junk-bond-financed $6.75 billion buyout of United Airlines collapsed on Friday, Oct. 13, 1989. The stock market immediately dropped 191 points or almost 7%, equivalent to a 1,500-point drop today. Scary.

&gt;Rod Berens, head of research at Morgan Stanley at the time, called a departmentwide meeting after the market closed. I dreaded going. I had a list of tech stocks I was recommending that got killed that day. When I showed up, I noticed several cases of champagne—a weird way to celebrate the loss of wealth. But why not? I grabbed a glass; it was Friday.

&gt;And then my boss headed toward me. Uh oh, I thought, he’s going to fire me. Instead, he smiled, gave me a high-five and said, “Congratulations, now it’s your turn,” and clinked my glass. Talk about confused—one of the worst days in my professional life and I get congratulated?

&gt;I didn’t see it at the time, but he was dead right. Eras change, sometimes overnight. Over the next decade, the stock market shifted from junk-bond-fueled buyouts, a dominant Japan and the Cold War to highly valued emerging technology companies, ending with the dot-com blowout.

&gt;The current market turmoil tells me a new era is breaking, so question everything. Will cable, energy, mobile and social media ever come back? And if not, what’s next?

&gt;Well, the knee-jerk reactions will come first. Most think the 2003 SARS epidemic in China ushered in that country’s era of e-commerce, but it was going to happen anyway—the crisis only accelerated it. So be wary about talk of robot and drone deliveries. It may come to that if the virus spreads, but the economics still seem far out.

&gt;Will energy stay cheap forever after this week’s devastation? I doubt it, but the economy can finally benefit from fracking’s cheap natural gas. I’d bet so-called clean and renewable energy was set back a decade by having to compete with lower prices. Cheap fossil fuels may also push back any new adoption of carbon-free nuclear energy.

&gt;More interesting is the emptying of countless college campuses, sending students home. Classes will be online-only until further notice. Smart. But at some point parents will surely ask, “Why again are we paying 78 grand a year?” Is the end of universities far behind?

&gt;Similarly, lots of companies are telling employees to work at home. Will an era of telecommuting and no rush-hour traffic finally arrive? Maybe not. Recall that early in Marissa Mayer’s tenure as Yahoo CEO, she banned working from home because so many people were, as they say, mailing it in.

&gt;The end of China’s dominance is certainly coming. No one will ever again concentrate manufacturing in China alone. Vietnam and other countries with low-cost labor will benefit. Maybe this is Africa’s moment. Related: A louder globalization backlash may arise again—but since consumers like cheap goods, it will flame out.

&gt;Another observation: Interest rates and the Federal Reserve may be increasingly irrelevant. The Fed’s job seems to be to ensure the availability of Treasurys—mostly, as we wrote last September, as collateral for the repo market, which finances an increasing share of global trade. The $500 billion announced Thursday is encouraging.

&gt;What about mobile and cloud computing, and even the stock market and its trillion-dollar valuations? It’s worth asking, as venture capital and private equity using cheap debt are keeping companies private longer, or forever. Others think it is value stocks’ turn to shine, but that usually requires a period of inflation that I certainly don’t see coming. Quite the opposite.

&gt;No, growth will still rule, but with a different set of leaders. In the bio world, DNA sequencing and Crispr gene editing are starting to ramp up. Health care will be transformed by new ways to detect and treat cancer and other ways to cure previously incurable diseases like sickle-cell anemia.

&gt;In the high-tech world, mobile seems tired. Apple’s hottest product is AirPods Pro, those Star Wars-inspired white sticks hanging out of everyone’s ears. That’s an accessory, not an innovation. Here’s hoping for some knock-your-socks-off new mobile products. Note also that we’re only about a third of the way into the cloudification of enterprises. And we’re only beginning to master machine learning and artificial intelligence, with their ability to find patterns that humans can’t. I think the next tech era will be driven by implementation of AI-infused systems into every business.

&gt;Finally, I asked the man himself, Rod Berens, whom he’d high-five today. He says that the past 30 year’s tech abundance means the developing world’s billions will finally see productivity improvements and attract an increasing share of investment. That’s probably right.

&gt;New eras are notoriously hard to predict. So instead of focusing on which cities are quarantined, start thinking about what’s next. Very few investors do."
8,2020-03-06,street-guru,1,$AMD Highlights from Investor Day in Santa Clara,"Analyst day was largely as expected. It was encouraging to hear management reconfirm Q1 guidance, although sales may come in at the low end due to the coronavirus (not a surprise at this point). Most assume sales will pick back up in the 2H, so full year street estimates are unlikely to changing much from this event.

AMD's pivot in GPU strategy from general-purpose GPUs to domain-specific GPUs seems like a smart move in adapting to the market evolution. The Radeon DNA will be optimized for gaming, while Compute DNA will be optimized for machine learning etc.

AMD's market share gain story has been rewarding for shareholders, but the biggest push-back now is its valuation (\~33x forward PE vs. \~19x for peer group), leaving some to wonder if all the good news has been priced in. AMD will likely get a top-line boost in 2H from gaming console refresh, but this is a low margin business.

As the ""second horse"" in the declining PC market, AMD still needs to prove it has a long-term profitable business model. $INTC and $NVDA appear to be in better financial position to strengthen their positions in both CPU and GPU markets. AMD chasing the low-margin gaming business could hinder its ability to improve profitability."

10,2020-04-25,rawrtherapy,1,How Power BI (Microsoft’s Self-Service Data Visualization Platform) will be their new Halo Platform that will lead Data Science,"**TL;DR: Power BI can add pre-made Machine and deep learning models. Recent press conference this was specifically mentioned for scale. I think Microsoft is planning a Machine Learning Store for commercial purposes working like the App Store for pre-made models.**

Also I work in the Data Science Field.

——————————————————————

As some of you may or may not know, Power BI has the ability to add pre-made machine learning and deep learning models internally

Once I learned about this I knew where Microsoft was headed

I’m thinking machine learning and AI will be a sort of addition to power bi users completely nulling the need for learning code, why?

Microsoft’s job is to make it as easy as possible for everyone to use their systems and this is why I think Microsoft will have a similar variation of the “App Store” for machine learning models and algorithms

Actual engineers will have the unique experience to be sort of like an app developer where they develop their code and publish it in the App Store and people using Power BI will be able to either download it for free or for a small fee

In their recent press conference about Power BI they mentioned pre-made models being directly implemented into the power BI software and said that this was done specifically for scale

In my opinion, I really think this is the direction Microsoft is headed with their Power BI software and their implementation of scale through Machine Learning for everybody

11,2020-04-24,quary1993,1,Predicting Bitcoin Price with Machine Learning and K-Clustering Unsupervised Learning,"I'm trying for some time now to develop a neural network that can predict bitcoin prices. Bitcoin is a great asset for such an experiment because it has fewer fundamentals than the other stocks or derivatives and it relies more on technical analysis than other assets. Nevertheless, it is impacted from time to time by the news and other events in the crypto-world.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working with TF (tensorflow) + Keras and LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) cells to try and predict future prices.

&amp;#x200B;

If I let the network guess freely, from some point onwards, without feeding the price of the tick before, the predictions look like this: [https://i.imgur.com/Qk50hdv.png](https://i.imgur.com/Qk50hdv.png) and this [https://i.imgur.com/OCRep8r.png](https://i.imgur.com/OCRep8r.png)

&amp;#x200B;

If i adjust it at every point in the dataset (feed the price of the tick before), it is needless to say that the graph of predictions is way more precise: [https://i.imgur.com/Y1H3n9z.png](https://i.imgur.com/Y1H3n9z.png)

&amp;#x200B;

There are few steps I would like to take to improve this

* Factor in Technical indicator (BB, Ichimoku Cloud, SAR, etc...
* Place a factor for fundamental analysis in the dataset (for example, a score for the positivity of the news at that specific tick (0=bad news for btc, 10=great news)\[/li\]
* Collect data from the order books of the largest exchanged and factor in the order book states at every tick
* Unsupervised learning and K-Clustering to find co-relations between bitcoin and other foreign currency (for example, it might be that there's an inverse relationship between bitcoin and the Yuan (generally when Yuan drops, Bitcoin rises). K-Clustering can find such relationships
* Merging all of the above into a trading bot that aims for around 30%-40% return a year

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone pursue such a goal? If yes, would you like to share the accumulated knowledge/ideas? :D

This is a serious project and currently, only me and two of my partners are involved in it, but we could sure use some more man-power. I'd also like to know if someone would like to fund such a venture and get involved.

No judgement. We've all been there.

At a certain point, though, your balls are going to drop and you're gonna grow the fuck up.

**Intro**

The way that the administration is currently handling the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic is proof that they have learned nothing from the government’s pitiful response in 2008

In this overview, I am going to be covering how the U.S. administration has addressed the coronavirus from an economic incentives standpoint. I will also be analyzing its response on how it’ll go about “flattening the curve” as stated in common parlance.

**Overview on the SBA and PPP programs (and how they’re going to COMPLETELY screw over the economy a la mortage loans in 2008)**  
As a response to the coronavirus, the government has decided to allow the Small Business Association (SBA) to give out loans to small businesses as a form of “disaster relief”. According to Reddit, banks are actually RUSHING out these loans to businesses that were overleveraged (i.e. had a significant amount of debt) before the coronavirus crisis occurred. What does this mean?

Once again, the U.S. government has decided that certain businesses are simply TOO BIG TO FAIL (Henceforth referred to as TBTF). That means that you can bet your bottom dollar that the U.S. government will do everything in its power to bail these companies out of bankruptcy to the best of its ability. This creates a significant MORAL HAZARD. These TBTF businesses now know that they will continue to be bailed out by Uncle Sam if (or, more likely than not, when) they fail and are on the verge of bankruptcy. So much for the notion of free-market capitalism :shrug:

Furthermore, banks just simply do NOT have the capacity to handle the sheer amount of SBA loans that business owners have applied for. By the time all of these applications are completely processed, it isn’t out of the question that a significant majority of these small businesses will go completely bankrupt. The fact of the matter is that many small businesses and business owners live paycheck to paycheck. In general, business owners are NOT your “1%’er greedy scumbag that just cares about profits and loves screwing his workers and pulling the wool of shareholder’s eyes” that Bernie Sanders and his motley crew would have you believe. Small business owners are similar to you and I, they’re just trying to get by financially. When these SBA loans don’t get processed on time, guess what? A lot of these small business owners simply will NOT have enough cash on hand to pay their liabilities (e.g. leases, worker’s salaries, etc.) and will be FORCED to shrink their business to stay afloat (leading to significantly decreased revenue, which investors do NOT want to see) or will be forced to go bankrupt.

**Trump’s pitiful and very, very sad stimulus checks**

Another economic response that the government has provided is the $1,200 stimulus check. Let’s see how this stimulus check will be handed out and who will receive this stimulus check.  
Single adults with $75,000 or less on their 2019 tax returns will receive a $1,200 check. Married couples will receive $2,400 jointly and an additional $500 for children under 17.  
The idea behind these stimulus checks is that it will jumpstart the economy back up by giving consumers money to be able to go out and purchase goods. However, does anybody realistically think that the $1,200 check is enough to sustain these families? Assuming the quarantine lasts longer than the middle of May (a significant possibility), a paltry $1,200 check will barely be enough for people to get by. Rent costs $1,200 or more in some cases for just one month. This stimulus check is in essence a virtue signal from the U.S. government to retail investors that they will intervene in the markets. However, the stimulus checks won’t actually do anything. That $1,200 will go by faster than the roadrunner escaping Wile E. Coyote.

Small businesses will continue to die off in droves, and enterprise companies will accumulate market-share and power as they begin to buyout companies or let their competitors go bankrupt.

**Faulty Unemployment Numbers**

[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/out-work-because-coronavirus-struggling-file-unemployment-n1175466](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/out-work-because-coronavirus-struggling-file-unemployment-n1175466)

Based on the news, as well as personal anecdotes from friends, it is VERY, VERY difficult to file for unemployment now. The offices are all backed up with people trying to file unemployment claims and there's a huge backlog that they need to take care of.

That means the number of unemployed people will be SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the numbers that the BLS will be putting out. Those unemployed people will be unable to go out and purchase goods due to a lack of cash, which will negatively impact company's earnings across the board.

**Actual Coronavirus and its Impact**

""The curve is flattening!!""

Yeah, the curve is flattening because we have a limited number of tests available. The number of coronavirus positive cases can't go up if you don't test them \*insert Roll Safe tapping on head meme here\*. There's a fuckton more people who are coronavirus-positive that we don't know about simply because we haven't tested them yet.

We still don't have a vaccine. Do you really think this shit is over with? Once we reopen, there's going to be a second wave of infections. That'll cause there to be panic again, which will possibly cause another lockdown/quarantine. At which point, we'll keep cycling being lockdown and reopening the eocnomy ad nauseaum until a vaccine is discovered. We will see the long-term effects of the coronavirus on company's earnings which will be reflected in quarter one and quarter two earnings. That means we have a MUCH longer way down to go from here for SPY.

**Impact of coronavirus and quarantine on mental health**

[https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/text-messages-crisis-hotline-coronavirus-mental-health](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tasneemnashrulla/text-messages-crisis-hotline-coronavirus-mental-health)

The coronavirus and quarantine is also completely devastating to people's mental health. This is a novel situation that people haven't faced before. People are more scared, anxious, and worried than ever before. This will also reflect in consumer purchasing decisions in the long-term. Consumer purchasing will be dampened until a vaccine is discovered

**Conclusion**

Now is the greatest time to buy puts on SPY with an expiration date of 6 months out or more. Don't buy puts with sooner expiration dates because Trump might find some way to manipulate the market in short-term. The fundamentals are clear: the coronavirus is here to stay. Earnings will be down for quarter one and stay down to quarter two and beyond.

With that being said, if the market is still up in the long-term and a vaccine hasn't been discovered, I can only conclude that either

1. The U.S. dollar has become completely worthless
2. The stock market is completely disconnected from the economy in every way, shape, and form and stonks only go up. Trump found the secret formula to make his 1% friends rich. Dump all your money in the stock market and hold hands with the Vice Presidents of Bank of American, Chase, and JP Morgan as we sing Kumbaya and eventually ascend into capitalist heaven while Kanye West's ""Selah"" is playing in the background. Adam Smith, the creator of capitalism, greets you with a smile. ""All money is a matter of belief"", he says. ""Individual ambition serves the common good"". You close your eyes. Earth is decimated. Life has ceased to exist on earth. The only action left are several computers running machine learning trading algorithms 24/7 trading against each other. The S&amp;P 500 has reached an all-time high of 5,000. One computer whirrs slightly louder than usual as it rewards itself for having 420% returns year over year. The heat death of the universe occurs several billions of years later. The trading algorithms are still running in the background, trading against each other. The heat death of the universe has been priced in. The S&amp;P 500 reaches 10,000

**Some thoughts on certain individual stocks**

**Zoom (ZM)**

Zoom, as you probably know if you are working remotely, is a remote teleconference tool that many companies are using. I believe that Zoom is VASTLY overvalued and that its current market valuation is based off of irrational investor sentiment as opposed to fundamentals of the market.  
The market is currently valuing zoom at a WHOPPING 42 billion dollars!!! Holy cow!!! When Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011, it acquired Skype for $8.5 billion in cash. That’s about $10 billion in today’s money. Is it realistic to think that Zoom is worth 4X more than Skype currently? Absolutely not!!!

Let’s look at the bull case for Zoom. Yes, a lot of people are using Zoom than ever before. However, these people are not paying for Zoom. Zoom went from $75 to $150 in a span of a month because… more people were using it. That’s about it. They’re not paying customers. Unless the quarantine lasts a long time, these companies will not continue to use Zoom and even if they continue to use Zoom they won’t be paying for the software.

Bearish case: Zoom’s P/E ratio is 1,700X. Holy moly, batman!!! Amazon, widely considered to be a significant growth stock, has a P/E ratio of 100X. Apparently Zoom’s multiplier is 17X larger than Amazon’s because…. Nothing. Seriously, can anybody explain how Zoom has such a larger P/E multiplier than Amazon? No, they can’t.

Number of privacy/security concerns with Zoom. Zoom says that they are trying to fix these issues but it is debatable how long it will take to get these fixed."

Back then was about 50 percent slower (ie what happened back then in 3 months now happened in 2). Applying that logic and using similar proportions we would have our bottom around August next year at around 8000 points. Of course this is all BS and nonsense, but there's one thing I can't get out of my head:

What's the chance all the machine learning driven trading algos are completely overfitted to that historical data point due to lack of other similar events? If so this would have been gone unnoticed so far (neural nets are mostly a black box assuming they use some of those) and it would even be a self fulfilling prophecy. Based on the model the algorithm would assume a certain target price and trade accordingly eventually leading to that exact price of enough players follow the same logic.
