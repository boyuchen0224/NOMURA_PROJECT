1,2020-01-29,mydandy11,1,"Seeking advice on $300k portfolio diversification and allocation (ETFs, dividends-based and cryptocurrency)","Hi all,

First of all, thank you all in advance for any advice and please do let me know if my post is appropriate- newbie here. I have a few questions regarding a big financial decision I had made last year and future financial/investing plans.

I'm 29 and currently working in a non-profit in NYC. Not making too much money right now just out of grad school. Family does have some funds and with it I purchased a \~$680,000 studio condo in midtown. Without too much knowledge of investment and homeownership I did feel that the purchase was a bit rushed for a couple of reasons: 1) we paid all cash. Now thinking back, perhaps financing would be a better option because now a big sum of money is illiquid? 2) a studio won't be a long-term ideal housing situation-probably will have to switch to at least one-bed when I decide to live with partner or family 3)property tax + HOA fees are a bit high ($1,300 combined). But what's done is done- I'll move in &amp; consider selling it in 2-3 years depending on the market trend. Still think it's not too bad an investment considering the location and carrying zero mortgage. Nonetheless, do you think it was a bad decision that I did not finance with the historic low interest rate? 

Main questions for this post- I will be able to access an additional $300,000 fund within these two years to put in investments and retirement accounts, and I am seeking advice on the allocations. Currently I primarily use M1 to learn the strategies - I'm sharing some of my 'pies' for references. My goal is to be financially independent from my employment income &amp; the capital gains + dividends earned from these accounts. Risk tolerance is high and my horizon is both long-term and short-term I guess? Def want to withdraw some gains per year (3-4% max) till I find better paying jobs. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. 15-20% I am thinking about putting in a 'passive income', dividends portfolio from the YouTuber Joseph Carlson:

[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbta0n8i6Rljh0obO7HzG9A](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbta0n8i6Rljh0obO7HzG9A)

My allocations are basically mirroring his: [https://m1.finance/gt3wyDoks](https://m1.finance/gt3wyDoks)

I know there are a lot of criticism surrounding a dividend portfolio like this so I am just trying out by putting a couple of thousands dollars in it to see how it performs. What do you think about this allocation with my overall portfolio and strategy? My main goal for this is to generate supplemental income. Dividend portfolio also seems to be less volatile in downturns? Is that true? 

&amp;#x200B;

2) 80-85% main ETFs portfolios

Current allocations are a mess - I am trying to achieve something like the following:

45% VTI 10% VOO 10% VEA 10% VXUS 5%VB 5%VWO 5% VO 5% VNQ 3%BND 2% BNDX

I also have shares such as iShare medical device, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF, iShares PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index Fund in my current allocations now (will be less than 1% each). Should I keep simplifying my allocations and ETFs? Should I just open Vanguard account and put the majority of fund into a Target Retirement Fund? Or do you think my personalized diversification will be ok and give me some advantages over time with my overall allocations &amp; strategies?

&amp;#x200B;

3) IRA- maxed out each year (just started last year)

My current employer doesn't offer retirement plans. So I can only open Roth IRA now. Here's my current allocation:

[https://m1.finance/DNAz4x6W2](https://m1.finance/DNAz4x6W2)

Again, do you think it's too complicated for an IRA? Or do you think my personalized diversification will be ok and give me some advantages over time? Should I simplify to 2 or 3 fund portfolio?

&amp;#x200B;

4) 5% or less- individual stocks and cryptocurrency

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you again for reading all these and I appreciate any advice and suggestions from everyone! Again, I hope my first post is appropriate &amp; will make necessary edits if not."
2,2020-01-25,Anaranovski,1,Motley Fool - David's Best Buy Now,"Summary from the post to avoid copyright issues.  I can say that, as of this writing, except for AMZN, they have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 for the 1- and 5-year period.  AMZN outperformed for 5-year but underperformed for 1-year period

YMMV

&gt; **Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN)** is one of the best companies in the world, one we've recommended multiple times in Stock Advisor. And it's still one of our top investing opportunities today, because it's keeping up a fast pace of innovation. Consider ongoing successes like Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud service — AWS has captured roughly half of the cloud infrastructure market, and it's still Amazon's fastest-growing segment.
 
&gt; It's been almost a year since we last named **Idexx Laboratories (NASDAQ: IDXX)** a Best Buy Now. Back then, I wrote that it had more than tripled for members who bought shares when we recommended it in July 2014. Well, Idexx has spent the last 11 months going even higher — it's now up 330% since that initial recommendation, better than a 4-bagger.
&gt; 
&gt; It's been more than two years since **McCormick (NYSE: MKC)** last appeared as a Best Buy Now in Stock Advisor. Over that period, its stock is up roughly 70% versus the market's nearly 30% — and that's just in stock gains alone. This dividend aristocrat's total returns outperform the market by a whopping 44 percentage points over that same time period.
&gt; 
&gt; In November 2018, **NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)** fell from grace, never to recover — or so the talking heads would have told you. Back then, the company was dealing with the fallout of an unexpected drop in demand for its cryptocurrency mining products. Nowadays, the chipmaker's world couldn't look brighter. Its graphics, high-performance computing, and artificial intelligence chips are key to advances in gaming, cloud computing, automotive connectivity, manufacturing, and healthcare.
&gt; 
&gt; There's an unquenchable thirst for data around the world, which is triggering an intense, high-stakes race in the semiconductor industry. That's great news for **Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS)**, a kind of behind-the-scenes quality assurance specialist that can benefit no matter which chipmakers have the upper hand."

9,2020-01-08,AncapElijah,1,Start investing in simple mobile mining cryptocurrency for free! Great for beginner investors.,"A great way to earn some extra cash over time by doing nothing, is to use a free mobile mining cryptocurrency. They cost absolutely nothing, and you get more money every day similarly to interest at a bank. No, this is no a scam, this is very common and how most cryptocurrencies work. By mining and finding ways to boost your mining rate you can make cash for doing nothing, seriously. (Although it’s intended that you use the coin and buy some, you don’t have to) I make 6 dollars a month from my cryptos, and I hope to double that soon!

Electroneum is the first, simplest, and best mobile miner, and is in the form of a free app. All you have to do is register, and you get 25 free ETN. This will grow over time at an average rate of 3 USD per month at first. It is exchangeable on almost all main coin exchanges Use this code: 2CC463, in order to mine 5% faster. You will be given your own code that you give to other people as well, that will boost your earnings.

XYO (or is it YXO?) is easy to get, and mines in a fun way. Buy the COIN network app to get coins that you instantly transfer to XYO just by walking! It’s like mining through Pokémon go! This coin can be traded for bitcoin and ether (big cryptocurrencies) by using kucoin.

Pi. Pi is a brand new mobile miner based heavily off of electroneum. This one requires work to raise your mining, but you can settle with the base mining rate. Pi is brand new and you should get with it while it’s still giving out a high mining rate. This March you will be able to send and recieve it as payment, and will soon be exchangeable for other cryptocurrencies. Use this code: elijahRM, as you need a code like this to use PI"
10,2020-01-06,jmil7,1,Investing advice for 20 year old,"I am currently 20 years old and go to college online. I still live at home and have very low expenses (~$4-5,000 per year). I have worked throughout college and currently have about $65,000 saved up. Roughly $20,000 is in my 401k and Roth IRA account. I also put about $2,000 into cryptocurrency about a year ago. Besides that everything else is cash and in my savings account. My biggest questions are should I put the rest of my money in an index fund right now, although many people, myself included, are expecting a potential pullback. I completely missed out on this last years gains, except my retirement accounts, and feel like missing another year like this would be more detrimental than a 20% loss. In the future I would like to venture into rentals, but for now want an easier way to see some returns while I continue to just save. If anyone could provide some advice/ resources that I could use to know where to invest the rest of my money I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks"

35,2020-02-07,kodjima33,1,Why I switched to crypto after I traded 10 years with forex,"I recently noticed that the Forex trading market is insanely regulated which means that the middlemen are present everywhere in this world, therefore, I decided to make my analysis about the so-called wonderful world of Forex trading.

Starting with unresponsive brokers and ending with smartly hidden fees and costs, the Forex trading process can become very expensive very fast and this can happen even before a trader can turn a dollar into profit.

This means that traders need to have a considerable amount of capital before they can begin trade. I also believe that institutional involvement is another significant aspect of Forex trading, unlike crypto, Forex traders are competing with established banks, high-frequency traders, and other specialized companies.

In a nutshell, I have found that this institutional involvement makes it very challenging to compete.

Here are some very interesting and productive facts as to why cryptocurrency trading is better than forex trading:

**1) Your safety, your money**

Unlike the Forex market where there are many suffocating regulations, as well as many cases of identity theft, crypto traders that use digital currency are in direct control of their transactions which makes everything much safer. Another important thing here that I’ve noticed here is that the transactions are made free from the identities of the parties involved. This grants a considerable amount of help in protecting users from all forms of identity theft.

**2) There is no inflation**

Every traditional currency experiences different inflation fluctuations because of the ongoing movement of global economies which shifts prices continuously. In response to this, countries print more money, therefore, increasing capital inflation. Cryptocurrency does not experience this issue. That’s why it is more predictable.

**3) Cryptocurrency trading is a clear process**

Unlike forex trading crypto trading uses a recorder which is called a blockchain, it is here where all transactions are recorded and monitored. In other words, when a transaction is completed it is automatically transcribed on the ledger. These transactions can be verified by anyone anytime. No person or organization can modify this ledger this is why this is considered to be the biggest security feature.

**4) Fast and solid transactions.**

Probably the best advantage, when compared to the forex market, is that the crypto market is free from any type of central banking regulations and control as well as other third-party vendors, that’s why transaction fees are extremely low.

**5) Availability**

The crypto investment funds bring many opportunities between parties anywhere in the world. These enable individuals to use and trade cryptocurrency even if they are from harsh countries without solid banking institutions.

**What are crypto funds and why they are beating forex?**

In the complex world of cryptocurrency trading, a user is required to have plenty of crypto assets.

Those who are new to this practice are already mining an abundant quantity of cryptocurrency, without the help of an investment fund this can be rather difficult due to the growing complexities of the prospecting process.

So I ask myself how can novices build up their assets?

This is when a crypto fund comes into the picture!

I’ve discussed with [trading specialists](https://fundplatform.io/?utm_source=reddit) who specialize in creating crypto funds to give you all the characteristics of what the crypto funds are as well as the new outcomes in this field.

A crypto fund is the regulated asset of a digital currency that is accessible to the investors for replication, it also works as a connection between a trader, who is producing the crypto fund, and the one who would gladly invest in that supply.

The concluding goal of engaging in a crypto fund is to augment crypto assets for both the winning participants.

In the year 2020, the crypto funds have evolved as the digital translation of fiat currency. Because this is an independent form of currency, it enables anyone to inaugurate a fund solely by adding a new cryptocurrency.

As a consequence, several types of crypto funds have developed aiming to gratify the desire of investors and traders so that they can ultimately increase their digital assets.

Many currencies are regulated by their governments making them sensitive to financial and pecuniary procedures as well as other geopolitical developments. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are managed instantly by clever algorithms and are only influenced by the actions of those using them. This makes the crypto market more engaging for investors who do not want vulnerability to inflation or state administration policy arrangements.

**Why did I invest in crypto funds instead of trading or mining**

Here are the major advantages that you may experience after you invest in a crypto fund:

* The leading advantage of financing in a crypto fund is that the cryptocurrency is going to be the money of the tomorrow. Therefore, financing in such crypto funds will aid you to earn a solid future.
* Most of crypto funds are open, sharing their asset structure with weekly reports
* People can invest in crypto funds from anywhere in the world
* Cryptocurrency mining has now grown more complex than it was in the past. Because of this, the rate of crypto mining is reduced due to the notable turnover of people towards cryptocurrency and the developments introduced in the mining algorithms. It became harder to track new movements in the market
* Investing in crypto funds fits a reliable method to develop your assets.
* Crypto funds offer greater profit margins.
* The volatility of assets is limited.
* As a crypto fund manager You can fundraise investments directly to your wallet without any type of fees
* Absolutely anyone can invest in your trading strategies even if they are a million miles away.
* You are not required to be legally registered (but if you want people to trust you - you have to be legally registered)

Ending Ideas

In conclusion I feel confident that Forex is now becoming a trading process of the past and it will continue to remain affixed in the 2000’s but now in the year 2020 the future resides in the crypto investment fund because it is a highly suitable method to earn money without getting stuck in any difficult mining algorithms.

**Overview**

Bitcoin is the world’s first decentralized cryptocurrency built upon open-source software and blockchain technology that enables a global, permissionless, and peer-to-peer financial settlement layer as well as a pseudonymous, immutable, and censorship-resistant store of value. It is the world’s first (and largest) unfalsifiable, digitally-scarce asset that removes the need to trust and rely on payment processors, banks, or governments in order for one to participate in the global economy.

**Bitcoin Strengths** 

* The most truly decentralized, censorship-resistant sound money in the world 
* First trustless, permissionless, and borderless global payments network 
* Largest user base / network effects / name recognition 
* Longest history of any cryptocurrency, with 99.98% uptime 
* Transparent and fully-auditable public ledger of transactions 
* A hedge against fiat currencies and US stock market as a new safe-haven, reserve asset

**Bitcoin Weaknesses** 

* Quite volatile when compared to traditional assets
*  Slow transaction times and high transaction costs for small transactions when compared to traditional, centralized services 
* Still a low adoption rate (&lt;1% of the world’s population) 
* Lack of regulatory clarity by nation’s governments"

39,2020-02-05,AlfonzAroch,1,E-Commerce and Marketing Investing Opportunity," 

Hello everyone, i'm a new investor/opportunist.

I'm barely 22yrs old so i'm pretty new to the game, but on my short-lived career i have managed to create a group of Marketers, Business Owners and Entrepeneurs called Dollar Economy (@Ecdollar).

With this small group i have achieved around $70k total, by joining several communities and taking advantage of uprising markets, such as Cryptocurrency and E-commerces.

I've stumbled upon this subreddit and figured i might give you guys, and anyone interested in jumping on the bandwagon to achieve financial freedom.

So... I'm preseting a one in a lifetime opportunity, with a new company that set it's sights on becoming bigger than Amazon and Alibaba, in the last 14months they have created several millionaires and they have opened over 12 offices around the world, in Europe, South America and North America.

# Neworkom

So, what's the deal? There are 2 offers, one is for bussineses, and the other one for entrepeneurs/investors.

If you are a business owner wanting to grow and reaching out to a wider variety of markets and audiences you can do so by being Licensed through this company to be able to sell your wares in virtually any part of the world, plus you'll be widely advertised and marketed (They'll bring the customers to you, and it just works.)

On the other hand, if you want to form part of the founders you can do so by investing certain amounts to be certified, for this you will be getting a lifetime passive income into your account. There are several goals, ranks and amounts. For example, if you invest $30,000 as part of the founders program, you'll get 1% of every sale that is made through the company, additionally, every month after the founders program ends you'll get up to $40,000 back to your account per month just by being part of the team that helped the company get into the radar on the first place.

The way it works is self-sustained, it's a ecosystem where investors help businesses to grow, and these businesses help investors back by splitting just 1% of their earnings. In comparison to Amazon, they would cost you roughly $457/yr or around thand mark, their sale comissions are way higher at around 4 to 5% of every sale you make plus their membership (still, they're the biggest and most widely known, so it's worth it in the long run).

And Alibaba is just outrageous, it's made with bigger providers on mind but they can cost you up to 15,000$ just to stay with them.

All in all. If you're interested you can reach out to me on our Facebook group [https://www.facebook.com/EcDollar/](https://www.facebook.com/EcDollar/)

Remember that opportunities are not lost, other people will simply take advantage of them.

52,2020-03-14,mac300010,1,Starting a portfolio,"Hey all,

I’m an accounting and finance student and have been looking to invest for a while now, it seems with Corona, the oil prices etc, now could be a good time to start. Of course nobody can predict what will happen and I think the market might still fall but want to buy it down instead of trying to time the peak.

The issue I’m having comes when looking to build my portfolio. I’ve only just started my uni course and have only started looking deeper into investing over the past month or two. 

I’ve set up a stocks and shares isa in Hargreaves Lansdown after a lot of research into the best platform to setup an ISA with, but am now also looking at some of these apps like Trading212, eToro etc and wondering if I should be using those also, perhaps a mix of platforms?

I’m also trying to work out how to invest, I want to invest over time and plan to invest for 5+ years, I’m also willing to take a certain level of risk to achieve somewhat aggressive growth. 

I’m trying to work out if I should build a portfolio of all individual stocks, my fear here is I wouldn’t be able to diversify the portfolio enough. To build a portfolio from just a mix of funds, or, my current favourite idea, to build a portfolio with a mix of some funds and some individual stocks. 

Currently looking at funds such as Fundsmith Equity, Aviva Inv UK listed equity income, M&amp;G Global Macro Bond, Jupiter Strategic Bond and JPMorgan Emerging Markets - I feel this gives me a somewhat good mix? 

For stocks I’ll probably be looking towards some big tech Apple, Amazon, Microsoft but also considering purchasing cruise stocks like Carnival since they’ve taken such a huge hit, however I think cruises will still be stopped for a while so it might take some time for those to start to rise, along with airlines. 

I’m not talking huge amounts of money but I’d like to move a chunk of my current savings across (as I said I’m looking to invest for the longer term so can afford some blips) and then I work part time through uni so would like to continue to feed excess wages into a mix of cash savings, and investments. So how do I go about investing. Say initially I wanted to put in 500-2000 over the next few months then a few hundred a month going forth. I know it’s not great just to split my stocks 1/5 each for example if I have 5. So would I be investing small amounts across my portfolio each time (e.g. 20 to Apple, 400 in Fundsmith, 100 in Carnival) or just one at a time, and if one at a time how should I kickstart my portfolio without just investing in one singular asset? I think I understand some of the fees for trading, so I’m charged an annual fee from Hargreaves for example, plus a fee from the fund I invest in. But will I also be charged each time I make a trade (eg £10 to buy 100 in Apple), in which case it would surely make sense to buy 200 and pay £10 instead of 100 twice and £10 each time if it’s a flat rate.

Slight side note, I’ll also want to put a small portion into cryptocurrency, but this will be done separately as I have a hardware wallet so I’ll just buy and transfer to that.

Sorry for the essay, so many questions and really want to get started with my portfolio just want to do it right and am overwhelmed with research. 

I plan to keep a log along the way as I invest so I can track what I’ve done, why I’ve done it and how my investments have performed."

And I hope there are not too many mistakes cause off-putting when you read as English is not my first language. Any recommendations, discussions, new ideas would be greatly appreciated.

**Overview**

At the beginning of March, dow jones, S&amp;P 500, cryptocurrency marketcap dramatically fell down due to the virus. That makes sense. About 3 weeks later, there were good news: these indices has been increasing, some countries has controlled the pandemic, not completely, but it is much better. Assuming we are at the beginning stage of the recession. The question is what happens next. I consider there are two scenarios:

**Scenario 1**: We control the pandemic well and governments’ actions can save the economy.

In this case, we will wait for covid-19 treatment vaccine and live together with the virus (coexist) just like we did before with other viruses such as H5N1, Ebola or SARS. In fact, as far as we know, mortality rate of this virus is not high . Also, it depends on underlying illnessesn. Serious and critical cases tend to be slower.

[www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/)

Moreover, probability of US recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 18.5% (compared to more than 20% that I saw at the last months of 2019).

*Everytime this number is larger than 20%, there is going to be a recession or crisis in from 12 months to 24 months ahead. Normally, a recession only last for 6 months. You can also have a look at constant maturity rate.*

[www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/capital\_markets/Prob\_Rec.pdf](http://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/capital_markets/Prob_Rec.pdf)

So, in other words, businesses (education included) could reopen, factories bring workers back, we will almost back on normal life (perhaps at the end of 2020 or at the beginning of 2021). This might be a good news.

**Scenario 2:** We cannot deal with the novel virus, people’s efforts cannot save the economy.

There has not been a country test all people. Only in developed countries, there are statisticians and epidemiologists good enough to use statistical models to estimate the reliable number or they have enough resources to implement broad testing. It means there are some active cases somewhere that have not been detected. Another point I suppose we shoud notice is that Chinese reported numbers is untrustworthy. There are also many non-symptoms cases.

Admittedly, these above indices (dow jones, S&amp;P 500) has been going up during the lockdown, I believe that this is governments’ efforts (the most obvious action is printing money), not from purchasing power from consumers or producing products of companies.

Additionally, civilian unemployment rate is not likely to go down again.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)

In this case, we face a depression.

Finally, there is a conflict in my head. But I personally think the probability of the first scenaro is higher and I have a bias towards it. Other than that, there must be “something new” after each recession (I mean changes). I expect this new change will come from blockchain, digital currency, bitcoin, ethereum.

# After all, for any predictions, the important thing is that we should make appropriate decisions, informed choices to your types of assets.

What is your opinion?

StakedWallet is a service that offers users to get profit from stacking and storage of crypto-assets.
Information about stakedwallet.io
The stakedwallet.io website looks quite unconventional for high-yield projects, as it is presented as a service for storing cryptocurrencies. Aside from keeping popular cryptocurrencies on the account, here you can also conduct exchange transactions and earn at a rate of domestic currency. The platform works on a self-written script, has a green bar, unique design, and a mobile app. Thus, the technical preparation is done at a great level and will allow the platform to work without failures.
The asset had first seen the light at the end of 2019, but became known to the public only on March 22, 2020. The administration chose Europe and the USA as priority regions for development. The start was as smooth as possible and without active promotion. Judging by the feedback, users' attention is drawn not only by investment conditions, but also by the bounty program and the referral system.


Investment conditions
The StakedWallet investors can profit here in two ways - by keeping cryptocurrency on the wallet and by investing in stacking. In the first case, they are offered to earn a return of 0.2% daily with the ability to withdraw money at any time.
Users can invest in stacking from 0.002 BTC. The deposit accrual will be 0.6% daily, and every 30 days the interest rate will increase by 0.1%. Such yield increase will be carried out up to 9 months from the moment of investment until the interest reaches 1.5% per day. After that, the interest rate will be lowered again to 0.6% per day and the whole cycle will start again. As for the deposit body withdrawal, it will be frozen for the first 30 days, after which the deposit can be withdrawn.


Marketing features
• Minimum deposit amount: 0.002 BTC.
• Payment systems: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, DashCoin, BitcoinCash, Dogecoin.
• Cryptocurrency conversion: none; the profit is accrued in project tokens.
• Minimum withdrawal amount: from 0.001 BTC.
• Profit withdrawal: instant.
• Bounty program: a participant can receive from 1 SWL to 500 SWL in project tokens for the execution of tasks.
• Affiliate program: 50% of the profit of five-level referrals.
Registration at Staked Wallet
1. Traditionally, to start earning with a project, you need to sign up on its official website. To do that, open the Staked Wallet website and press ""Get started"" in the top menu.



2. You will need to fill three lines of the registration form. Specify your e-mail address and password (you should enter it twice). Then accept the agreement, pass the anti-bot check, and click ""Create account"".



3. Only when your account is created, you can proceed to the investment. To do this open the ""Deposit"" section, choose the payment system, and specify the amount. Then click ""+ Add"".



4. You will be given the cryptographic address to be copied. You will need to send funds from your wallet to this address.

5. You will be able to withdraw your earnings by request, which can be made in your personal cabinet. To do this, click ""Send"", and then specify the payment system, amount, and other details"
75,2020-04-19,akontonasakis,1,Anyone think the USD reserve status is being overthrown by the world financial powerhouses?,"Does anyone else see what's happening here? The Inited States is printing trillions of dollars of currency, and vastly increasing it's domestic dollar velocity. But most people don't realize that the United States dollar is the reserve currency, the money where every other currency in the world is tied to, and as such they all contain VASTLY HUGE amounts of American dollars. And all those countries store their gold in our country, but they lately have been buying back their gold (crucially, in american dollars) in increasingly more frequent intervals. So all this American currency is coming back to America, drastically increasing the amount of money, leading to inflation and eventually hyper inflation (where the dollar is so plentiful that prices rise to meet the demand of the lowered buying power of the dollar.) This is going to cripple the American economy and drastically devalue the dollar. But, as the reserve currency, every other currency in the world is valued against the dollar. But if America's economy is about to implode, why are so many countries buying their gold from us, firther increasing inflation, devaluing our dollar, and by extension theirs? Do you think the global economies are plotting to replace the US dollar as the reserve currency of the world with another currency, possibly even a cryptocurrency?"
76,2020-04-18,Morgan442,1,CRYPTOCURRENCY recommendations,"What cryptocurrency do you think’s going to take off next just like bitcoin??



A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets.[1][2][3] Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.[4]

The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.[5]

Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency.[6] Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created."

78,2020-04-16,PsychiatricCliq,1,Wanting to invest 20k in XRP (crypto) due to the big banks and their use cases. Thoughts and alternatives? Would love to hear them!,"I want to invest 20k in XRP, according to [AustralianfinTech](https://australianfintech.com.au/westpac-says-rba-issued-digital-currency-would-boost-blockchain/);

“Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank, Macquarie Group and nine other international members of the R3 consortium have completed a trial of blockchain technology which saw funds transferred between banks across borders using Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP....”

“Westpac says RBA-issued digital currency would boost blockchain”

This is for Australia at the moment, personally I’ve taken a break from altcoins and just hodling; so would love some ideas for an Aussie crypto investor in terms of alt coins and/or bitcoin investment with the sum being up to 20k AUD.

Open to hear your thoughts about this and perhaps maybe alternatives if XRP isn’t the best way to go? My thinking around this is if the big banks of Australia are getting in on it, and actual use case for the blockchain; it seemingly sounds viable. Please do feel free to correct me! 


I’m also open to other avenues besides blockchain altcoins; such as anything bringing 8-12% returns p.a. 


Thanks all, looking forward to your thoughts and suggestions.

EDIT: I am, financially speaking - very well off. This 20k is merely just me looking for other avenues for passive income. My properties are doing well, but now that use cases are internationally becoming accepted due to their former xRapid facade, liquidity and what not. Just struck me as an opportunity. Thanks so much for
The replies guys!"
79,2020-04-15,BiggieMoe01,2,Is the cryptocurrency hype over?,"Hello all, I am relatively new to investing so pardon me for any potential aberration I might say. If this question is more appropriate for another subreddit, I’ll repost it where it should be :) 

My friends talked to me about a decentralized cryptocurrency that you can mine on your phone, called Pi. To be honest, I am highly skeptical about it. First, I think that the scheme of being able to mine a cryptocurrency on your phone without any energy consumption doesn’t sit right with me. Bitcoin requires a significant power supply and powerful video cards, hence its value. The fact that you can mine Pi without spending any energy leads me to think that its intrinsic market value (if it reaches the market one day) will be close to 0 and won’t ever be higher than a couple of dollars. 

Second, I’ve been looking at the price of some cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, and they seem to be relatively stable, which leads me to think that the cryptocurrency bandwagon/hype is over, at least for the next couple of years I think, until the next groundbreaking computing advancement. 

I’m interested to hear your opinions about this, whether there is still potential somewhere in investing in crypto. And again, I’m sorry if there are aspects I didn’t take into account or don’t understand, I started reading about investing and cryptocurrencies literally 13 minutes ago :p"

81,2020-04-10,TSPninja,1,A Long-term Investment Strategy (IRA + TSP),"Some of the components of my strategy might be against the grain here, but here we go... Please share your opinions about my strategy so I can consider other ideas. The best strategy is always changing. Goes without saying, but this is not investment or financial advice.

Base Assumptions

• Fortunate that earned income is stable and predictable through retirement.
• For equities, TSP Business Cycle and Bellwether investing strategies make sense, are easy to follow through with, and models have shown they can outperform the market in the long term. See: https://tspsmart.com/Bellwether-Timing-Results &amp; http://www.tspallocation.com/the-business-cycle-theory-of-investing/
• Historically, at some point all fiat has failed and USD is not immune to this. Economic crisis happen several times per generation and are often unpredictable.
• Historical precedent supports precious metals as a reasonable hedge against fiat issues and economic declines.
• Technological innovation behind cryptocurrency supports it as a viable future hedge against fiat issues and economic declines. Although volatile, it performs. Volatility will improve over time.
• Holding a portion of assets in precious metals and cryptocurrency will not make you any worse off in the long run.

Business Cycle Terms based on this chart: http://www.intlcorn.com/seedsiteblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/business-cycle-graphs.jpg

Business Cycle Indicators: http://www.tspallocation.com/how-to-determine-the-business-cycles-current-phase/ &amp; http://www.tspallocation.com/tspresources/#indicators
        
Asset Allocation Zones per Business Cycle Stage

Zone 1: Contraction/Recession Stage
• Equities- 0-10% (C Fund/VOO: 60%, S Fund/VXF: 40%)
• Bonds-10-20%
• Cash/G Fund-40-50%
• Precious Metals-20%
• Cryptocurrency-10%

Zone 2: Recovery/Expansion Stage
• Equities- 60-80% (C Fund/VOO: 60%, S Fund/VXF: 40%)
• Bonds-0%
• Cash/G Fund-0%
• Precious Metals- 10-20% (If performing well, this is last asset to reduce and move
into equities)
• Cryptocurrency- 10%

Zone 3: Prosperity/Peak Stage
• Equities- 80% (C Fund/VOO: 80%, S Fund/VXF: 20%)
• Bonds-0%
• Cash/G Fund-0%
• PreciousMetals-10%
• Cryptocurrency-10%

Zone 4: USD Collapse. Complete Crisis.
• Equities- 0-20% (C Fund/VOO: 60%, S Fund/VXF: 40%)
• Bonds- 0-20%
• G Fund only (no cash)- 40-50%
• Precious Metals- 40-50%
• Cryptocurrency- 10-20%

Notes:

Zone 1 is hardest to predict, especially if it is led by some crisis. Indicators may not be as obvious.

The Bellwether investment strategy may be worth exploring, but current focus is on Business Cycle investing until balancing between Zones 1-3 has become proficient. Bellwether investing would entail a portfolio re-balance twice annually between Zone 1 and some variation of Zone 2 or 3.

Zone 4 only applies in a severe economic crisis caused by fiat collapse. Basically USD is ending. In the event of severe hyperinflation, find somewhere comfortable between Zone 1 and Zone 4 allocations."

As much as 10% of cash purchases made with the co-branded credit card from San Francisco-based Fold and Visa will be credited to users in Bitcoin, Fold Chief Executive Officer Will Reeves said.

84,2020-04-09,xmrhaelan,2,What’s Your Hedge Against Long-term Fed Market Manipulation Risk?,"Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. Do your own research. 

The continued uptick in equities only make sense when considering one factor: the Fed. The level of market manipulation we are witnessing by the Fed is unprecedented and rather frightening.

Unemployment in the US alone is passing 20 million this week. Next week will continue to rise.

From Bloomberg 4/8/2020:
In Germany, new-car registrations in March -- usually a peak month -- plunged 38% from a year earlier, and a reading in the U.K. tanked 44%. Three of the biggest Arab economies buckled, a services index in Brazil was the lowest since 2016 and vehicle sales in South Africa slid 30%. In Australia, which has dodged recession for three decades, job advertisements plummeted by the most since 2009, even though the nation didn’t go into a strict lockdown until late in the month.

The Geneva-based arbiter of international commerce (WTO) predicted a range of scenarios, from an “optimistic” 13% drop in global merchandise trade that would rival the Great Recession of 12 years ago to a pessimistic plunge of 32% rivaling the Great Depression of the 1930s.

The optimistic view would mean a 2.5% contraction in global GDP this year, the WTO said, while the worst-case scenario would see an 8.8% decline.

The bleak outlook echoes projections from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which are both expecting a major downturn this year, as well as the increasingly gloomy projections of private economists.

With investment set to slide and more people out of work, global GDP rates could dip lower depending on how long governments maintain their lockdowns -- many of which are expected to last into May or June. The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that for each month of containment, there will be a loss of 2 percentage points in annual GDP growth.

——

When you consider all these stats, the equities market continuing to rise to 2019 economic performance levels only makes sense with Fed market manipulation. 

Central bank bailouts are like a shot of heroine for markets. Every time the economy sees a crisis the dope dealer is there for our next high. This does not make healthy markets. This only increases our risk of insolvency and hyperinflation for the long term. A crisis is supposed to weed out the poorly managed and over leveraged companies and industries, so the recovery will be on the backs of the strongest companies with the healthiest business practices. We cannot keep bailing out the crack addicts.

Fed pumping the market might work this week, it might work next week. Hell, it might even work for this entire crisis (doubtful). However this sort of behavior is not sustainable and it is irresponsible. How can we expect to be better prepared for a future crisis if companies don’t learn from their mistakes? The Fed is only enabling unhealthy market practices to continue.

At some point, central bank failure will kill us. Maybe they will become insolvent, maybe it will play out via a financial debt crisis that can only be bailed out at absurd levels, maybe through hyperinflation, maybe some other unforeseen crisis will be the straw that breaks the camels back. Gold bugs have been warning about these scenarios for years.

When the inevitable happens do you want to have your entire portfolio in equities that will fall to unprecedented levels? It seems prudent to me to keep a portion of your portfolio in hedges against this scenario, because it may happen even sooner than any of us expect (READ: Don’t be a greedy crack addict).

When central banks fail, fiat dollars will fail. People stuck with only government issued fiat will scramble to move wealth into other stores. They will see God’s money, gold, as a safe alternative. Others still will see People’s money (open-source, decentralized cryptocurrency) like Bitcoin and Monero, as a new alternative. As we saw with Gold a few weeks ago, the time to buy IS NOT when the panic is happening. If you wait until then there will be no supply left for you.

Feel free to continue riding the equities roller coaster. A prudent investor will still allocate a portion of their portfolio to precious metals and cryptocurrency. In another decade, or next month, they will not be any worse off for buying those hedges now.

Since Bitcoin was designed in the wake of our last financial crisis, I will conclude with the quote from Bitcoin’s genesis block, inserted as a time stamp by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin: 

“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”"

91,2020-04-06,OGKebabEater,1,Invest in an Upcoming Island Nation," 

Hello all,

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

the subbreddit is reddit.com/[r/theredditnation](https://www.reddit.com/r/theredditnation/)

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy (for now I will be the “king”)  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

96,2020-05-08,GotScammedByBrokers,1,I got scammed by brokers,"Hey, I dont really know how to proceed on this one so let me explain my situation.

I contacted RoyalCBank and let them persuade me into investing 250€ in cryptocurrency to their wallet. They assured me that the deposit was enough to make progress, even though fairly slowly, but they began pushing me to invest more fairly quickly. I was even recommended to sell my car or take out a family loan, so they had more options to work with. 

After being very clear about not wanting to invest any further and wanting my deposit back, their ""manager"" literally told me I wasnt worth his time and hung up on me. Since then my withdrawal requests are being cancelled without my consent, none of my ""financial analysers"" are answering my emails or requests for a call and their general customer support is unable to do anything helpful either.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way to get my money back? They did do a few trades, but what was gained through them is for ""trading exclusively"" and to be honest I dont think there was any real trading done. I believe they are a big scam company and will eventually disappear without any trace.

97,2020-05-03,Afluentblog,1,How Ethereum can be your route to financial freedom,"Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher. The system then went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins minted.


Is Cryptocurrency Worth Your Time and Investment?
We all know that cryptocurrency is on the rise and day by day the clamour for the digitalization of the whole world keeps trending hence in the few years to come it has been forecasted that cryptocurrency coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other types of coin will sweep the whole banking system.
Cryptocurrency is dynamic system, i call it digitalized money because it can be used to purchase anything even, it has been widely adopted by most online payment gateways for means of transaction.



Crpytocurrency: The right investment or Not
I know you keep asking yourself maybe you should invest in Crpytocurrency, If your mind keeps saying Yes i would say follow it.
Crpyto isn't really a physical bank, that's keeps your money for you and deduct useless charges for doing some particular activities. It is a system which is subjected to change, that's why it is an investment that is not totally risk free but has a high Return on Investment and if you play your game right the risk is reduced to technically 0%.
I said above that Crpytocurrency is subjected to change in the sense that different crypto coins has a price and the price of each coin is subject to decrease or Increase over time. So that is why capitalizing on investment opportunities is very important.
We all remember when Bitcoin was introduced to us, we turned it down and said no. Now 1 Bitcoin equals
3,422,106.32 Nigerian Naira. If we have invested into bitcoin it was first introduced to us, I would have a house in banner island by now.
But Now the same opportunity bitcoin opened to us that we never looked its way. Another Coin is offering the same opportunity



Ethereum On it's Way to Stardom
Ether is the second most popular coin after bitcoin.
1 Ether equals 80,994.71 Nigerian Naira. Too expensive to invest into right? You are thinking of closinh this page right after seeing the price. Bitcoin offered the same opportunity ethereum is doing now.

Ethereum has been forecasted to double, even tripple and sextuple to $1488 by end of 2020
, now think about having even $10 worth the coin and it eventually increase to that amount, look at how much you are having at the end by just holding a $10 worth ether. But what i am about to introduce to you now will make you a DON on the Crpytocurrency world


The Million Money
It is a platform created on the basis of Crpytocurrency but only on Ether coin
