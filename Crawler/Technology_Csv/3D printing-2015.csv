0,2015-01-21,legendarycars,0,Help - Invested in a Pump and Dump before I knew what I was getting into.,"Hey All,

So I invested into DPSM on the OTC market. It is a company called 3D Pioneer. www.3d-pioneer.com. 

I was originally attracted to them because they had the promise of some new 3D printers and software and figured it would be a good place to get into a small 3d printing company. 

Anyways, it turns out that this company is what people like to call a pump and dump? It is my understanding that this company only existed to rally shares from a low price to high price so people could flip a quick profit and then dump the shares leaving any suckers behind holding the bag (me).

I would think this would be illegal, but it appears that it isn't..

I've lost most of my money in this company now, and I'm not sure what to do. The stock is still around but they haven't had a news release for several months. 

Is there still a chance that this company might be legit and rebound? Should I just try and sell my shares for whatever I can get for them and forget about it?

Thanks all."
1,2015-01-18,workhorse_investor,98,Two Old Jim Cramer Speeches/Articles I keep to Maintain my Sanity in an Irrational Investment World,"I was inspired by [this recent post on AAPL's short term price prediction](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2st9jj/my_top_pick_for_next_week_aapl_heres_why/) to share two old Jim Cramer articles I keep on my computer for posterity. These articles speak volumes in their own right regarding the follies of being swept up in market euphoria, lack of independent thinking, reliance on analyst opinion, and short term orientation. 

I don't mean to single out the reddit post above--this actually pertains to the TSLA/Bitcoin/3D Printing/etc investors as well. It pertains to many of the posts on this sub. 

So here are two hilarious articles from a former Goldman employee/""famous investor"" who sold several bestsellers on investing, has a TV show on investing, and runs a whole website on investing: 

1) [""The Winners of the New World"" Feb 29, 2000](http://www.thestreet.com/story/891820/1/the-winners-of-the-new-world.html)
The article begins: 
&gt;You want my top 10 stocks for who is going to make it in the New World? You know what? I am going to give them to you. Right here. Right now.

&gt;OK. Here goes. Write them down -- no handouts here!: 724 Solutions (SVNX), Ariba (ARBA), Digital Island (ISLD), Exodus (EXDS), InfoSpace.com (INSP), Inktomi (INKT), Mercury Interactive (MERQ), Sonera (SNRA), VeriSign (VRSN) and Veritas Software (VRTS).

Right off the bat many will be able to predict what would have happened to a portfolio of these 10 companies (hint: not pretty). You can easily look up what happened to most of these. The real juice in this article is what comes later. I recommend reading the entire article for education/entertainment, but here are some money quotes:

&gt;They make the Web faster, cheaper, better and easier to access anywhere, anytime. They allow you to get on the Web securely anywhere in the world. They make the Web economy the only economy that matters. That's all they do.

&gt;We try to own every one of them. Every single one. And if I had my druthers, I wouldn't own any other stocks in the year 2000. Because these are the only ones worth owning right now in this extremely difficult, extremely narrow stock market. They are **the only ones that are going higher consistently in good days and bad**. I love every one of them, just as I loathe the rest of the stock universe.

Continues...

&gt;How did it get to the point where **nothing else matters, most particularly the 90% of the stock market I have studied for the last 20 years?** How did all of that knowledge become totally **irrelevant** and the only stocks that work are the stocks of companies that didn't exist five years ago and came public in the last two or three years?

Continues...

&gt;Just yesterday I found myself wishing I had bought i2 when it lost out to Oracle for the giant business-to-business contract for the Big Three automakers. Others had the same idea because i2, the loser Friday, was up much more Monday than GM and Ford could be this year. i2 can own the world because the company with the access to cheap capital always wins. And the companies with no access have to lose.

Continues...

&gt;How did this bizarro world where nine-tenths of the companies I have followed as a stock picker for the last 20 years are losers and one-tenth are winners? To answer that question, you have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that existed before the Web. You have to throw them away because they can't make money for you anymore, and that is all that matters. **We don't use price-to-earnings multiples anymore at Cramer Berkowitz. If we talk about price-to-book, we have already gone astray. If we use any of what Graham and Dodd teach us, we wouldn't have a dime under management.**

Continues...

&gt;But what about the Old Economy stocks? Can Merck (MRK) raise the bar? Can Pfizer (PFE)? Can U.S. Steel (X)? Or Phelps Dodge (PD)? Union Pacific (UNP)? No, no, no, no, no and no. So what happens to them? Despite the billions in buybacks and the plethora of strong buys that the Street has put out about these companies, their stocks have no traction. 

Continues...

&gt;How can Bank of America (BAC) compete with Nokia (NOK) as a way to bank? How can Goldman Sachs (GS) compete with Yahoo! (YHOO) as a way to invest? Isn't Nokia, with its wireless machine that goes everywhere a better bank than one that needs branches? Isn't Yahoo!, with its access to all of the information and quotes in the financial world a better place to buy stocks than Goldman?

Continues...

&gt;That's why, despite the 80% increase in the Nasdaq last year, we are looking at another record year now. It is by that process of elimination that I have picked my top 10. And my next 10 and my next 10 after. Only those companies are worth owning.

&gt;James J. Cramer is manager of a hedge fund and co-founder of TheStreet.com. At time of publication, his fund was long 724 Solutions, Ariba, Exodus, Digital Island, InfoSpace, Inktomi, Mercury Interactive, Sonera, VeriSign, Veritas Software, Oracle, TheStreet.com, Vignette, Motorola, Cisco, Intel, Nokia, Goldman Sachs, and Yahoo!, and Cramer was long TheStreet.com. 

Reads like satire, but it ain't...

2) [""Gold Surges to Nominal Euro &amp; Pound Record - Jim Cramer Critiques Warren Buffett On Anti Gold Bias"" July 11, 2011](http://www.businessinsider.com/gold-surges-to-nominal-euro-and-pound-record-jim-cramer-critiques-warren-buffett-on-anti-gold-bias-2011-7#ixzz3PCiEcsKS)

&gt;Jim Cramer Critiques Warren Buffett Over Anti Gold Bias
&gt;Jim Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money"" has critiqued the Sage of Omaha, Warren Buffett, and his anti gold bias. Buffett has said that gold isn't a sound long term investment because the precious metal has no ‘utility’. 

&gt;“No one goes to Warren Buffett and says how have you done versus gold in the last 10 years. That is verboten. You are not allowed to ask him that.”

Someone should ask Cramer about his performance from 2000 to 2011...(lol)

&gt;Cramer said that this “makes it very difficult to make headway with people” about owning gold.

&gt;While Buffett snubs the value of gold, Cramer emphasizes the limited amount of gold bullion available and gold’s rarity (see GoldNomics video), as well as the lack of new gold being mined. Cramer says that there is **far less gold than there is Berkshire Hathaway B shares and that Buffett can just print the shares**.

GoldNomics!

&gt;“I would rather buy the insurance policy of gold than the insurance policy of Geico    … pretty simple.” **(to laughter)**

&gt;“He (Warren Buffett) would does us all  …  he is doing everyone a **disservice** by saying that it’s a beauty contest.”

Yes, Warren Buffett did a disservice to investors by telling them to stay away from gold in 2011 (which is down 20% since then and hugely underperformed the S&amp;P and **Berkshire stock**). If Warren Buffett is doing investors a disservice, exactly what service is Jim Cramer providing to his follower investors???

Bonus to article #1 above: Warren Buffett on sitting out of the tech rally in 1999: [""Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market The most celebrated of investors says stocks can't possibly meet the public's expectations. As for the Internet? He notes how few people got rich from two other transforming industries, auto and aviation."" Nov 22, 1999](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269071/index.htm)

So above you have a guy who essentially threw away everything he learned about investing and went All-In at the top of the tech bubble. He did it for short term (1-2 year) outperformance (and yet most people don't even see 1-2 years as short term). You'd almost thing the article was complete **satire** when reading it! And then he did it again with gold 11 years later. 

/Much to learn."

My question is, what are your outlooks for the 3D printing industry over the next 5-10 years. This is entirely speculative but I'm interested in who believes its a hoax, and who believes it will change the world.

8,2015-04-25,h18dalton,9,Is it worth buying stocks in different currencies and exchanges?,"I'm a beginner investor, just formulating my first portfolio. I'm in the UK, so currently it only consists of ETFs in GBPs and British companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. I'd like to invest in 3D printing and robotic surgery equipment however I can't find any applicable companies on the London Stock Exchange but there are obviously plenty on the US exchanges. Is it worth using my UK based broker to buy stocks on the Nasdaq or NYSE? Or am I exposing myself to more expenses and more risk?

The way I see it, by buying a stock in USD, not only am I exposing myself to the risk of the company, but also the exchange rate. In addition to that, my broker may give me a terrible exchange rate both in purchase and sale. Advice needed.

The robotic surgery company i'm interested in is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) but I haven't properly analysed the financials yet. There are about 5 3D printing firms (DDD, SSYS, VJET etc.) i'm looking at but again, haven't done the analysis. My timeframe for these investments is 5+ years."

11,2015-04-13,prospectiveinvestor,12,"Trend investing has been very successful over the years and resulted in phenomenal growth when the right trends are identified. Examples include the PC, rise of e commerce, the transition from traditional forms of advertising to modern forms etc. What do you guys think are the major future trends?","Trend investing has been very successful over the years. By this I mean investing in companies that benefit from trends that regardless of cyclical behaviour will experience growth in the future, due to changes in trends and consumer habits. If the trend is identified and then companies are found with a large enough market share and competitive advantage, the returns can be phenomenal. The argument for this is that even the best of managements and companies in the wrong industry or on the wrong side of consumer trends are powerless.

History has many famous examples of trends and changes in consumer habits, the rise of personal computer, the importance of the Internet in society, recently the rise of smartphones and apps, the rise of ecommerce, the transition from traditional forms of advertising to modern forms and the list goes on. These trends have resulted in outsized share price gains for various different companies including Microsoft, IBM, APPLE, Google, Intel, Qualcomm, Facebook just to name a few.
 
But what are often not considered are the implications these trends have on other more traditional industries. As investors may be reluctant to invest in industries that are directly influenced or trying to pick the company that will dominate that industry in the future. However, the reality is that even if you do not consider yourself a “growth investor” you still need to understand possible future trends. Why? Let us look at several examples, for example the affects of the rise of ecommerce on delivery companies. The affects of electric cars and more energy efficiency in our technology on oil companies. The affects of wearable technology that promote healthy lifestyles and monitoring of health on fast food companies. The affects of crypto currencies on banks and payment companies.

So guys as I hope I have explained trends are very important for the growth investor as well as the investor who may not consider himself a growth investor. 

What do you think are the future trends in our world?

Some examples: cryptocurrencies, 3D printing, advertising changes, cloud based services...."

15,2015-05-18,b0ners4u,1,L'Oreal to team up with Organovo to print 3D skin cells for product testing.,"I met with the management of Organovo last fall during their roadtrip. ONVO differs in their 3D printing technology and yields a product that has a longer shelf life and less defects in production. Furthermore, they are the only company that can produce 3D assays (there are other ""3D bioprinters"" out there, but they can only print 2D or only a couple of cells thick).

Their liver assay is used in liver toxicity testing for new drugs. So instead of going to human trials to test for toxicity, pharmas can use Organovo to conduct research. If it's safe in the labs, they can then spend the money for human trials.

This stock is something to keep an eye on; it will likely be a takeout target. With EU nations banning animal testing for consumer products, multi-nationals like P&amp;G, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, etc will rely on ONVO going forward for product development and testing.

This is a known phenomenon where the public gets excited about a new technology and the price skyrockets...  Only for people to realize that moon isn't coming tomorrow.  
  
So the price falls.  
  
But the work keeps on happening behind the scenes.  And the foundations get stronger.  Eventually a sharp price correction upward rectifies things.  
  
For these companies to have a P/E in the low double digits is absurd.  This is manufacturing technology that will change the entire world from a corporate level down to a household level.  
  
But be aware that I'm not saying to buy in now.  The stock market is testing through new peaks every week, and no one knows when we will face a major correction.  I don't know how hard a crash will hit the 3D printing sector since they are already quite depressed, but I'm sure that a major collapse in equities won't look kindly on speculative technology like this.   
  
But these stocks **definitely** need to stay on your radar.  
  
They may provide some of the best investing returns of our lifetimes once the technology catches up with the hype (soon), and once we return to a more rational price for stocks (soonish).
