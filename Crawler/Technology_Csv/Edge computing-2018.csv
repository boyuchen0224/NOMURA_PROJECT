1. The world’s biggest privacy regulation GDPR goes into affect May 25 2018. 

If there is one thing that people know about the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) it’s that GDPR fines (administrative fines) can go up to 20 million Euros or 4 percent of annual global (note global!) turnover, whichever of both is highest. 
https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdpr/gdpr-fines-guidelines-application-penalties/ 

Figure this one out: Just shy of 100 percent of U.S.-based privacy professionals believe the importance and complexity of managing privacy in their organizations is increasing. 

Similar numbers (97 percent!) acknowledge they will increase their investment in managing privacy. Yet fully 61 percent of these same professionals acknowledge they have done little to prepare for the coming of the world’s biggest privacy regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. What’s more, 99 percent admit to needing additional help in preparing for the GDPR.

2. DATA443 (OTCPK: LDSR) ClassiDocs Wins Numerous Industry Awards – GDPR 100 days awayPress Release | 02/13/2018 

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. is pleased to announce that its recent acquisition – ClassiDocs - has won prestigious industry awards for GDPR Compliance, Data Classification and Governance in the 2018 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards. 

Gold Winner 

“This is validation for the whole team. The volume of support we received from the community surprised us but does match the feedback we get from clients and partners – that the ClassiDocs product set is an on-point technology that facilitates many requirements of the upcoming GDPR legislation and provides for a unique and feature-rich Data Classification and Governance solution,” stated Mr. Remillard, CEO of DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. today. 

“Congratulations to DATA443’s product team for being recognized as the gold winner in three categories: Data Classification and Data Governance. The GDPR category – a new one this year – had the ClassiDocs GDPREngine product place first also as a gold winner,” said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the 400,000-member Information Security Community on LinkedIn that organizes the awards program. ""With over 400 entries in more than 70 categories, the 2018 awards are highly competitive and all winners truly reflect the very best in today's cybersecurity industry."" 

“We have worked very hard on our GDPR functions – adding capabilities that are grounded in true use cases and deliver immediate value to the client. Our forthcoming GDPREngine technology delivered in a SaaS model delivers GDPR compliance capabilities faster and with much less total cost of ownership for clients,” added Mr. Remillard. “We will be making this officially available for beta clients in the coming month – the GDPR Deadline is fast approaching – 100 days exactly today. We are seeing increased demand worldwide for capabilities – matching our initial analysis that GDPR applies more broadly than just the European Union.” 

About Cybersecurity Insiders 
The Cybersecurity Excellence Awards are organized and managed by the team at Cybersecurity Insiders – the same group that manages the 400,000+ member information security technology professional LinkedIn group. The organization also produces numerous webinars and deep industry research for all facets of information security. It is headquartered in Maryland, US. 

About DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. 
DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (OTCPK:LDSR) (https://www.data443.com) is a technology company that is actively developing and acquiring cyber-security products &amp; service offerings that are central to blockchain, cyber data security, GDPR, compliance and governance capabilities. The Company develops its own technologies and has an active acquisitions program in place. 



3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR’s requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies – those with greater than $500 million in revenues – say they will hire a consulting firm.

4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe’s New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

“Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. “G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.” 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR – new rules, wider reach – the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the “most ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era” – and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

I am not by any means saying Metlife, Allstate and TD Ameritrade will be ClassiDocs customers, however I am saying that when they look for GDPR, they will go to N8 Identity for help. ClassiDocs may not get chosen but it will have potential access to thousands of businesses.

1,2018-04-17,ElectronicGold,34,"Microsoft ($725.09 B) just surpassed Alphabet/Google ($724.96 B) and Amazon ($697.84 B) in market cap, and with augmented reality, cloud computing, and the Surface lineup, MSFT is a BUY","Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon are neck and neck these days when it comes to technology and market cap. Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&amp;J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel)."
2,2018-08-23,wirsteve,390,What's reddit's opinion of the next big thing in tech?,"Pretty obvious what it is now, ""Cloud Computing"". Companies have to ""move to the cloud"". Some companies don't even have directors of IT on staff, they just hire a consulting firm to move them to the ""cloud"" but they don't know what it is.

Let's say 5 years ago

* Everything was hosted locally or with an IT provider. Citrix for example was popular
* The number of apps in iOS app store and Play store have tripled - mobile is king
* Businesses slowly started to look at technology as a need and not as a luxury

Now 

* SaaS is king, hosting data in Azure, AWS or Google's data centers is popular
* Citrix is still used but in a different capacity
* You need a mobile app to pair with your website / company to be looked at seriously
* eCommerce has been changed dramatically with Square &amp; competitors

So what's next?

* Edge networking?
* A boom in security spending?
* Machine learning?
* Blockchain?
* VR &amp; AR?
* Internet of Things?
* Smart kitchens?
* 3D Printing?

We all know deep down, whatever the infrastructure is now, and whatever is popular now won't be in 2023. I'd love to hear what you guys think. Obviously my list isn't what you have to pick from. It's just some things that I think could potentially take off."
