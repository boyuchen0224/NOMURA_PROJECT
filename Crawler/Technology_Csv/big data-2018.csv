&gt; By Saumya Vaishampayan
&gt;
&gt; Jan 30, 2018 4:21 am ET
&gt;
&gt; **The dollar just can’t catch a break: long-term investors have collectively turned negative on the U.S. currency this year for the first time since 2014.**
&gt; 
&gt; Asset managers—the likes of pension funds, endowments and some mutual funds—now hold more bearish futures and options contracts tied to the ICE U.S. Dollar Index than bullish ones, and they have done so all year, according to data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
&gt; 
&gt; **Put another way, these investors, who together control hundreds of billions of dollars of investment money, are now betting the dollar will get weaker.**
&gt; The last time these investors held a negative view on the greenback was nearly four years ago, but it only lasted a week and the net number of bearish contracts they held was negligible.
&gt; 
&gt; The market data is the latest sign that strong economic growth around the world, not just in the U.S., has boosted the relative appeal of stocks, bonds and currencies in places like Europe and emerging markets. Big investors’ decision to rotate money out of U.S. markets and into other regions has helped drive the dollar lower over the past year, analysts say.
&gt; 
&gt; **The bearish view held by asset managers contrasts with the current collective stance of hedge funds and other leveraged investors, who started betting on a stronger dollar after President Donald Trump signed the tax overhaul bill into law in late December.** Hedge funds had been negative on the dollar for much of the second half of 2017.
&gt; 
&gt; “Near-term, leveraged fund positioning tends to correlate with price action for currencies, while asset managers’ money is more sticky,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Singapore, who tracks CFTC data for both asset managers and hedge funds.
&gt; 
&gt; The dollar rose 0.2% by Tuesday afternoon in Asia, based on the ICE index, which measures the dollar against the euro, yen and four other currencies. The euro fell 0.3% against the dollar while the British pound dropped 0.6%.
&gt; 
&gt; *[see article on WSJ for chart]*
&gt;
&gt; Of course, the data in this chart represent a small slice of the total foreign-exchange market, as they reflect only futures and options bets tied to the ICE U.S. dollar index, not heavily traded currency pairs like the euro versus the dollar or the dollar against the Japanese yen. Mr. Goh estimates these asset managers are the most net bearish on the U.S. dollar on record when measured against the euro, yen and other major currencies.
&gt; 
&gt; **Still, it’s a piece of evidence in the $5.1 trillion-a-day currency market that shows how investors are simply finding better opportunities in non-dollar assets.**

2,2018-01-22,wait_whatamidoing,2,Sociological trends with regards to value investing,"Sociological trends can be regarded as one of the few things that allow the common man to find good value in this market. I'm not discounting the effectiveness of quants or assigning value to companies based upon well establish equations. But some of that inherently is speculation, due to the fact one of the variables in those equations would be future projections of revenue. Future revenue that is largely driven by sociological trends.


The market is very efficient with crunching numbers. But overall, I'd argue that traders aren't the most astute people with regards to understanding what others will do. A general weakness of economics, and something thats been studied quite a bit in the last few decades.


How many iPhones will be sold, how fast will Facebook/Netflix/Amazon grow their user base, how many people will be purchasing self driving cars into the future, how many people will continue to get into the crypto currency market, will people continue to move their business away from retail stores into the online space, how quickly and to what degree will smart-houses/the internet of things catch on, how prominent will videogames or sports be into the future, how quickly/to what degree will people purchase solar panels for their houses, how quickly/to what degree will electric cars catch on, how quickly will the infrastructure and laws required to govern these new technologies be created and implimented, how quickly will Virtual Reality catch on. You get the idea.


All of these are speculative. You can't create an equation to perfectly predict these things. Perhaps in the future that will change. But currently, people can't know the answer to these things. Its just guesses. Guesses that people try their best to turn into a variable and add in to their equations, but as I said, its inherently speculative, and its fairly rare that someone is both a quant and a sociologist. Two very different fields of expertise.


I think if you reflect upon the history of the last few decades and consider some of the biggest value investing plays, many of them were due to a misunderstanding of the sociological aspect of a company or product. Cryptocurrency being tied to the growing distrust of governments and large institutional banks, for example. Netflix, and people not understanding how popular it would be to get access to all this (commercial free) entertainment on their computers instead of theaters/TV. Facebook/other social media exploding in users, to the extent some people are arguing it should be treated as a public utility. Big data and people miss-valuing what you can do with it, in regards to marketing, with that much information on your consumers.


I'd appreciate your thoughts, if you made it to the end of this. "

4,2018-01-08,GTCnews,1,WEEKLY OUTLOOK,"The global financial markets will focus on U.S. economic datas this week, including Friday's inflation report in the spotlight, and for further clues on the timing of the next FED rate hike.
China is to release monthly trade and inflation data, while the U.K., traders will be awaiting a report on manufacturing production for further indications on the continued effect of Brexit on the economy.
Quarterly earnings season kicks off with eight companies on the S&amp;P500 this week.


**TRUMP - THE NEXT MOVE**

Looking to boost domestic energy production, Friday the Trump administration has proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, including in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. That would reverse the Obama-era order placing 94% of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers.


**CRYPTO**

Prices retreated from last week’s record highs after Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges for cryptocurrencies said that it has not made a decision to add new currencies to its platform. This dried out recent speculation that it would include Ripple. Ripple now has a market cap of $130 billion, in second place behind Bitcoin. Ripple sells blockchain technology, powered by its own cryptocurrency XPR, to banks and payment providers and other financial institutions to speed up cross-border payments.


**GOOGLE’s CHINESE PRESENCE**

Google made an undisclosed deal in China on E-sport streaming, with gaming live-stream company Chushou. There are other investors as well. Chushou has around eight million streamers and 250.000 live streams per day. Google’s search engine is blocked in China and the tech giant has used investments as a way to broaden its presence in the market.  - Google took a minority stake in Chinese AI startup Mobvoi in 2015 during a $75 million fundraising round.


**GREED INDEED**

Verizon has pulled Bloomberg TV from its offerings for 4.6 million subscribers, after being asked to pay for the content. VZ's argument is that Bloomberg is making the content available to all consumers for free via web and mobile app, and that it shouldn't have to pay carriage fees.


**VW IS STILL THE BEST**

Volkswagen group sales rose to around 10.7 million cars last year, keeping the German behemoth ahead of its Japanese competition as the world's largest automaker. The report came as Ron Stach, senior vice president of sales at Volkswagen of America, left the company. U.S. sales rose 5.2% to 339,676 brand models last year but dropped 19% in December as the carmaker shifted focus to its homeland.


**TECHIES**

The tech industry's biggest conference - The CES -, this week from Tuesday to Friday. Speakers include Ford (F) CEO Jim Hackett, Verizon CTO (VZ) Hans Vestberg, Qualcomm (QCOM) President Christiano Amon, YouTube's (GOOGC) Robert Kyncl and Baidu COO (BIDU) Qi Lu. Talks and exhibitions will be on artificial intelligence, augmented reality, 4K TVs, robots and new drones, and these are just part of the buzz.


**#DAILY PICK**

**Continental AG (CHXEUR:COND)** is scheduled to give earnings tomorrow, watch the numbers!

A monster week ahead of **Google, (NASDAQ:GOOG),** there is a lot more in it!

**Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)** is fighting $24.50 on the upside. - And $23.98 on the down. Who’ gonna win?

Shuffle your dividend growth, **3M Co. (NYSE:MMM)** is a must have!

**Gold (FX_IDC:XAUUSD)** had a good run, time for a reversal.


**FX WORLD**

Friday’s NFP has missed big time and our pairs reacted accordingly, or in cases not so subsequently. We are going to have an interesting week, with FED rate hike clues.

The **EURUSD** had a nice run on the NFP report but pulled back to 1.20, which seems to be the support at this point. The pair is still “fighting” 1.21 as it froze the market a bit, if we break it, 1.23 or even 1.25 is doable.

The **GBPUSD** also rallied and turned to the downside. Above 1.365 would mean that we closed a massive gap below and could offer a buy and hold market. Until then just buy the dips, as 1.3333 is the floor.

The **USDJPY** has bounced on Friday, which is interesting since the jobs report numbers missed significantly. This shows that the market is interested to go 115 and beyond. Until we break above, use the dips for entries.

6,2018-02-10,BBTB2,4,[Tinfoil ?] Current Market Drama: Could this be results from a hack? Read before making assumptions.,"#Quick Introductory Short Story

***
 So I enjoy playing a game called *EVE Online: A Super Serious Spaceship Game*. It's cool and fun but that's neither here nor there. It does, however, have an advanced in-game economy like none other and mimics the fundamentals of supply vs. demand similar to real world markets. Much like every other video game there is botting and I wanted to use the notorious EVE market bot as an example for a precursor (*for the record botting is against the rules and will get you banned*). I have never personally used any botting software but from what I understand and observed is the bot simply updates buy and sell orders once it realizes it's been outbid or undersold, keeping a profitable spread. With that being said some people have managed to pinpoint certain assets where multiple bots are active. They then manipulated the buy and sell orders with their own just enough that it resulted in a hilarious bid war between said bots that ultimately inflated price of said asset until one shut down.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#Are Big Fund Market Algorithms Vulnerable?

***
I would normally assume that investment firms, hedgefunds, etc. all have the best security and IT money can buy but [the hacking of Equifax sorta took that hypothesis out back and shot it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-18/equifax-is-said-to-suffer-a-hack-earlier-than-the-date-disclosed). It is probably safe to assume these algorithms used for position hedging are extremely complex and secure, however, could they be influenced by external factors?

Much like the primitive EVE market bot I referenced earlier - I'm curious to how market algos would play out in a situation where they went unchecked with an active ""offensive"" market algo in play. This ""offensive"" market algo would be designed to throttle prices upward by influencing our market's algo tools into a bid war... in layman's terms. I understand the complexity and would prefer to not spend hours rabbling on how they work. One could hypothesize this would not be incredibly hard a task (*for a group with relevant skills*) if information was collected on said algos inner-workings... leads me to my next point.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#Cyber Warfare and Recent Hacks

***

There has been a [drove of hacking lately](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3243108/security/biggest-hacks-security-breaches-2017.html) with many U.S. entities falling victim, [even as recent as this week](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/russian-hackers-hunt-hi-tech-secrets-exploiting-us-weakness.html). Some of these victims are very involved with the stock market such as investment platform [Scottrade (2015)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/10/02/scottrade-broker-hacker-breach-46-million/73233356/), investment banking giant [JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (2014)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/02/jp-morgan-security-breach/16590689/), and as previously mentioned [Equifax](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/10/02/equifax-breach-hit-2-5-million-more-americans-than-first-believed/725100001/). They mainly point towards ""*the data breaches*"" however I feel it's completely plausible malicious software could have been left behind to collect information on algorithmic tools utilized by said entities. It would also be possible for said hackers to pool small funds taken from each affected individual into a large fund. The large fund would later be used in offensive algo manipulation campaign. There has been a significant amount of news on various hackings but I feel it's probable that these stories are all smoke screens for something far more sinister.

Anyway, what I'm getting at is the hypothetical possibility market algos could fall victim to external manipulating factors that would result in hyper inflated bubbles. These massive bubbles would expand from algos running wild against one another at which point the price is propped up only by the underlying botting battle.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#Why Am I Pondering This?

***

First off I know that a large portion of trading is done by real people. With that being said we can't neglect the exponentially increasing involvement of market algo tools processing massive orders every .001 second. I mean 9:30 to 10:30 am EA is essentially an episode of robot wars every day. A constant battle back and forth of hedging .005 cent trades to direct an underlying equity down or up into it's desired PT for the day. Put and option contracts are bought and sold as powerful computers process hedging software to calculate positions that minimize exposure long term. 

I'm rambling, sorry, anyway - algo vs. algo: what made me think about this besides a game about spaceships? Look at the volume. Seriously. Look at that [explicit REE'ing Spoiler](/sp ""fucking daily volume holy dog shit something is fucked up""). The "" *Trump Bump^and^dump* "" can only explain for so much before you realize ""*wait... there is a lot more going on there...*"". What the hell happened last year? Let me illustrate what I'm talking about.

&amp;nbsp;

**NOTE** I'm using Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform w/ additional indicators specified below:

* The chart is set to daily over 10 year period.

* QTY x4 ""EMA"" are provide in light blue, dark blue, green and purple representing 50, 100, 200, and 365 (Modern) respectively.

* ""M"" is set to 90 days w/ over-bought and over-sold being 2,000 and -2,000 respectively.

* ""RSI"" is set to 90 days w/ high and low being 60 and 40 respectively.

&amp;nbsp;

Take a look at the DOW Jones Industrial chart I MS Painted on:

https://i.imgur.com/7EHCJrP.png

Is it me or is that volume surge rediculous? Trading volume quadrupled+ and look at those over-bought indications complimenting the price rise.

&amp;nbsp;

Now take a look at the S&amp;P 500 chart I also MS Painted on:

https://i.imgur.com/qOQbb1L.png

Same deal as the DOW... where is all that volume surge coming from?

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

#I'm Tired Of Typing: My 2 Cents

***

As stated initially I am more curious about the potential than I am pointing fingers while holding the tin-foil cone firmly atop my head. The volume surge, over bought indicators, lack of correction, and exponential rise in pricing clearly indicates what could be interpreted as market algorithms battling one another. I am entertaining the idea that one or more hedge calculating tools were corrupted and/or altered to remove restrictions. This corruption or unrestricted state could thus be influenced upward outside of buy and sell order norms by offensive market algos. It's just a thought, interested in your feedback.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:** The DOW, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P have another -10% move down to go as stocks become overheated.  I'm also entertaining one of what could be a million reasons why the market is falling.

https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-stockpickers-burden-and-other-lessons-1521460800

By
Leslie P. Norton and Dan Lam
March 19, 2018 8:00 a.m. ET

In 1962, the young writer Tom Wolfe wrote a sympathetic profile in the Washington Post about a 30-year-old mathematician who had learned how to beat the house in blackjack. The mathematician, Edward Thorp, described how to figure out the sequence of the cards and how to bet accordingly.

The story went viral. And Thorp, who taught math at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then at the University of California, Los Angeles, became an instant celebrity who wrote best-selling books about his techniques. (In fact, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes used a key idea from one of those books for their formula to price options; they subsequently won the Nobel Prize.)

Thorp also invented a wearable computer that could beat the casino at roulette. Soon, he took what he knew and began applying it to the stock market and taking private clients. One early admirer was Warren Buffett, who having briefly shut down an early money management vehicle because stocks were too expensive, advised a client to sign on with Thorp. In 1969, Thorp opened Princeton Newport, a quant fund that returned 19.1% a year until 1988. A few years later, Thorp started a new statistical arbitrage fund using techniques he discovered in 1980.

“Ed is known as the father of quantitative investing, but his genius has really been the ability to identify inefficient areas of the market and figure out ways to take advantage of mispricings,” said Steven Friedman, founder of the Santangel’s Investor Forum, an investor conference. Thorp shut the second fund down in 2002, when returns “were down to the low teens. I didn’t want to work for the low teens,” he recalled.

All along, Thorp has been writing his books, including the entertaining and informative memoir A Man for All Markets, which comes out in paperback next month. We caught up with Thorp, now 85, just before he left for a hiking vacation in New Zealand. In this first part of the wide-ranging interview, he told us how stock markets are like casinos, and why index investing is worth it.

Barron’s: How did you become the father of card counting?

Thorp: In high school, it occurred to me that the roulette ball moves in a stately orbit like a planet. I thought it might be predictable. I did a lot of doctoral work in physics, and was convinced I could predict from the motion of the ball and the spinning rotor roughly where the ball would fall, and if I did so I would have a huge advantage. That’s what got me interested in gambling. I went to the casinos in Christmas of 1958, and while there I read an article from a statistics journal that showed how to play blackjack so you lost slowly. I decided the game was beatable essentially by keeping track of the cards. So I got all the information from the people who wrote the article, improved their calculations, and used those calculations to figure out how to count cards.

I was at M.I.T. at the time and [entered the data into] an early high-speed computer that was available to the faculty. After nine months, I had my results. I saw that indeed you could beat blackjack and do a nice job. I announced it at the American Math Society, which was attended not just by mathematicians but lots of other characters like Tom Wolfe, and then it went viral on the Associated Press wire.

Q: Why are some tables hot and cold?

A: If the game is honest, most of the time it’s just random fluctuations. Those random fluctuations are what I think of as luck.

Q: How are casinos similar to the stock market?

A: Imagine you are investing in an index fund. The casino is Mr. Market, who offers you a collection of bets. If you choose an index fund, say VTSAX [the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index fund], on a typical day it randomly fluctuates by 1%. But there is a long-term drift in your favor of about one twentieth of a [percentage point]. So if you had $1 million in your portfolio in such an index, Mr. Market will come to you each day and say, “Let’s flip a coin. If it’s 50/50, then you’ll win $10,000 or lose $10,000. But I’ll pay you $500 if you play that day.” If you play for one day, you’ll be at $9,500 or at $10,500. If you play for a year, the chances are moderately good that you’ll be ahead because those $500 payments add up and overcome the fluctuation. Maybe a third of the years, you’ll be down and unhappy. But if you play for 10 years or 20 years, then those $500 payments just keep adding up.

Warren Buffett has also devoted his life to compounding. So a similar process happens at blackjack tables. If you’re counting cards, you have a little drift in your favor. But in blackjack you play 100 hands an hour, and in a week you may play 4,000 hands. In a casino, you get to the long run fairly quickly.

Q: That stock market drift you’re talking about—are those the real numbers?

A: It is five basis points a day. [A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.] Multiply that by 250 days, and it’s about 12.5%. The historical geometric growth is about 10.5%, because of the fluctuations.

Q: Given that drift, is stock-picking even worth it?

A: There are three types [of investors]. One wants to do well and not spend a lot of time. Those should be passive investors, and they will beat most of the others who will be dragged down by fees and costs and punished by what I call “the scared-rabbit syndrome,” which is that they run out at the bottom and get back in at the top. The index investors who just buy and sit avoid all these issues.

Then there is the small group of investors who want to be professionals—hedge fund managers, people who work for endowments, universities, and so on. I might add that they haven’t done all that well. Then there are people who just enjoy messing around in the market and are willing to spend time to get an education. For them, I say, take a small amount of capital and learn. But put most of it in an index fund where it will grow while you are busy getting your education and paying for it.

I paid for my education and know it can be fairly expensive. My book talks about some big mistakes and also about the Kelly Criterion formula, which tells you how to allocate money between risky alternatives and gives you an idea of how much to allocate to each.

Q: But before applying the Kelly Criterion, as you’ve pointed out, you need to know how big your edge is. How do you do that?

A: At a casino, you can generally calculate your edge fairly precisely. In the stock market, it’s not so easy. For an index fund, the statistical numbers we’ve viewed are probably not too far off what you can expect going into the future, assuming the world stays something like the world we know and the U.S. is the successful country it is. It doesn’t have to be the only superpower. The historical experience in first-world countries goes back for centuries. So we have a pretty good idea what the statistics are going to be for equities going forward.

Then take those numbers and shade them somewhat conservatively, using [your assumption of] rates and tail risk. Then you can do a pretty good conservative calculation of how much to invest. But really, don’t borrow. You can make much more if you borrow when things are reasonably good, but every so often, something nasty happens.

Look at all those people who were in the VelocityShares VIX Short Volatility Holding exchange-traded note. For years people minted money and kept telling me how great it was. I studied it, couldn’t see their edge, and I could see the black swan downside. Sure enough, it was wiped out last month.


Read part 2 of our interview with Edward Thorp, “Why Edward Thorp Only Owns Berkshire Hathaway”

In the second part of our interview with card counter and mathematician Edward Thorp—the father of quantitative investing—he recalled an early brush with Bernie Madoff, described what’s in his portfolio, shared his solution to gun violence, and served up the secrets of a long life. He also shared his most recent list of what he does to promote healthy longevity, which we post in its lightly edited entirety below.

Barrons.com: All the way back in 1991, you were suspicious about Bernie Madoff’s returns.

Edward Thorp: I was asked to review the portfolio for a client, the pension plan of a large international consulting firm. I looked through their various managers. All looked fine except Bernard Madoff Investment Securities. The returns were exceedingly regular—1% or 2% a month no matter what was going on in the market, using an allegedly simple strategy of an options collar. Even when the market went down, they had magically guessed they should put on a large short in S&amp;P index futures. It couldn’t be right. I asked the client for confirmations. For half of them, the trades never took place on the exchange that the tickets said they traded on. Then for another quarter of them, the volume didn’t match the exchange volume.

I called a friend at Bear Stearns and asked him, as a special favor since I was a large client, to get information on trading on 10 particular options on certain days. The 10 options they checked for me showed no evidence they were connected in any way with Madoff. So I told my client this was an absolute fraud and he needed to pull out. Of course, it didn’t blow up for 17 years. Some people were enraged that I never told them, but I had a fiduciary obligation to keep my mouth shut.

Q: What’s in your portfolio now?

A: One good stroke of good fortune was meeting Warren Buffett in 1968. It led me to realize that I needed to invest in Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.A), although I didn’t do it until 1982. It’s my single investment in the stock market. It’s like a broad value-stocks equity index. I hold it in lieu of VTSAX [the Vanguard Total Stock Market fund]. It does about as well with no current taxes to pay. VTSAX has dividends that are taxed annually. I also have some hedge funds, but I consider them not as good as Berkshire, so I use them to spend and finance other things I do.

Q: Why not go out and find better investments, as you did in the past?

A: When I was 35, I had lots of time and less money, so doing 10% or so better than the index, with little risk, was attractive and fun. At 85, the marginal value of time is higher and the marginal value of money is lower. These are strong disincentives when I can make a long-run 10% or so by doing nothing.

Q: There are a lot of quant funds in the market today. Is there so much competition that the inefficiencies, which at one time you would have exploited, are gone?

A: I don’t think so. The quant funds trawl through massive amounts of data. But there’s a lot of information about companies that aren’t in the available data, including strategic thinking. Take, for instance, the fact that some companies buy back stock intelligently and some do it very stupidly. The intelligent ones buy back stock when they’re getting their money’s worth, when it’s actually worth paying for the shares because they’re underpriced. Take an extreme case where the stock has liquidation value of $10 a share and the company can buy back stock at $8 a share. Many closed-end funds are in exactly the situation I just described. They just don’t happen to buy back their stock because they don’t want to reduce the amount of capital they manage and [thus] reduce their fees. There are a lot of things that involve thinking that artificial intelligence isn’t going to find.

Q: What do you think of stocks?

A: Stocks today are on the high side and will be hurt as rates rise. We are probably late in this cycle. We’re due for a slowdown and maybe another severe correction. If you’re a long-term investor, though, equities are the way to go.

NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP

Q: What lessons do you want people to come away with from A Man for All Markets?

A: That the best thing you can do for yourself is to educate yourself to think clearly and rationally. It helps to have math or science or logical training. The next is to be widely read and curious. If you are that way, you have so much more to use in terms of tools. [Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman] Charlie Munger has a collection of multiple mental models—shorthand ways to think of things. I also have my own, and one of my favorites is to understand externalities [spillover effects from other economic activity].

For example, if I buy fire insurance for my house, my neighbor is a little safer. That’s an externality benefit. If someone drives a polluting gasoline car and uses the atmosphere as a waste dump without paying any consequences, that’s a negative externality. Another one is guns. Gun dealers make a lot of money, their clients go out and kill people, and society pays huge costs. Gun dealers don’t.

Externalities are a good way to start analyzing problems. A lot of problems go away if you make people who distribute negative externalities pay the consequences. There’s a neat solution. Automobiles kill about 35,000 people a year. If you want to drive a car, you need a license, some training, and also insurance if your car does damage. People have to be accountable for their guns, just like cars. If your car is stolen, you are expected to report it. [What if it were the] same with guns? People wouldn’t be able to accumulate thousands of guns, because what insurance company will insure it? What do you think the insurance would be for an AR-15? It would be very high.

Q: You’re 85 and look like you’re in your early 60s. What’s your secret?

A: I think rationally and clearly about how to slow aging. I’ve been exercising since my 20s. I started running marathons when I was 47. I’ve run 22; my personal lifetime best is 3.17 hours. I spend five hours a week in vigorous walking or easy jogging. I work out with a trainer twice a week. I feel I should do more. I have a body-mass index of 22 and am comfortable there. I try to eat semi-intelligently. I have never smoked. It has got to be one of the stupidest things. I have never met Jim Simons of Renaissance, the greatest quant hedge fund guy ever, because he was a chain smoker and I didn’t want to go into his office. You should think about your overall health and fitness plan. You are your own best health manager. Get started by telling yourself: Some is better than none, and more is better than less.

1. The world’s biggest privacy regulation GDPR goes into affect May 25 2018. 

If there is one thing that people know about the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) it’s that GDPR fines (administrative fines) can go up to 20 million Euros or 4 percent of annual global (note global!) turnover, whichever of both is highest. 
https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdpr/gdpr-fines-guidelines-application-penalties/ 

Figure this one out: Just shy of 100 percent of U.S.-based privacy professionals believe the importance and complexity of managing privacy in their organizations is increasing. 

Similar numbers (97 percent!) acknowledge they will increase their investment in managing privacy. Yet fully 61 percent of these same professionals acknowledge they have done little to prepare for the coming of the world’s biggest privacy regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. What’s more, 99 percent admit to needing additional help in preparing for the GDPR.

2. DATA443 (OTCPK: LDSR) ClassiDocs Wins Numerous Industry Awards – GDPR 100 days awayPress Release | 02/13/2018 

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. is pleased to announce that its recent acquisition – ClassiDocs - has won prestigious industry awards for GDPR Compliance, Data Classification and Governance in the 2018 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards. 

Gold Winner 

“This is validation for the whole team. The volume of support we received from the community surprised us but does match the feedback we get from clients and partners – that the ClassiDocs product set is an on-point technology that facilitates many requirements of the upcoming GDPR legislation and provides for a unique and feature-rich Data Classification and Governance solution,” stated Mr. Remillard, CEO of DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. today. 

“Congratulations to DATA443’s product team for being recognized as the gold winner in three categories: Data Classification and Data Governance. The GDPR category – a new one this year – had the ClassiDocs GDPREngine product place first also as a gold winner,” said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the 400,000-member Information Security Community on LinkedIn that organizes the awards program. ""With over 400 entries in more than 70 categories, the 2018 awards are highly competitive and all winners truly reflect the very best in today's cybersecurity industry."" 

“We have worked very hard on our GDPR functions – adding capabilities that are grounded in true use cases and deliver immediate value to the client. Our forthcoming GDPREngine technology delivered in a SaaS model delivers GDPR compliance capabilities faster and with much less total cost of ownership for clients,” added Mr. Remillard. “We will be making this officially available for beta clients in the coming month – the GDPR Deadline is fast approaching – 100 days exactly today. We are seeing increased demand worldwide for capabilities – matching our initial analysis that GDPR applies more broadly than just the European Union.” 

About Cybersecurity Insiders 
The Cybersecurity Excellence Awards are organized and managed by the team at Cybersecurity Insiders – the same group that manages the 400,000+ member information security technology professional LinkedIn group. The organization also produces numerous webinars and deep industry research for all facets of information security. It is headquartered in Maryland, US. 

About DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. 
DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (OTCPK:LDSR) (https://www.data443.com) is a technology company that is actively developing and acquiring cyber-security products &amp; service offerings that are central to blockchain, cyber data security, GDPR, compliance and governance capabilities. The Company develops its own technologies and has an active acquisitions program in place. 



3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR’s requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies – those with greater than $500 million in revenues – say they will hire a consulting firm. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html






4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe’s New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

“Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. “G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.” 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR – new rules, wider reach – the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the “most ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era” – and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

12,2018-04-27,Jowemaha,0,How are payment processors still around?,"Credit fraud costs the American economy  **1 trillion** Venezuelan bolivars a year, and creates a big incentive to steal card info, mug people, and hack into company's data centers. It's very destructive to society and the merchants end up paying for it. The fees are exorbitant as well, 2.75% fees on revenue for retailers is like their entire net margin. 

I don't see why we don't have purely digital payments based on more secure technology, like I don't know, say an iPhone face ID. 

My first thought was to short the payment processors. But then I realize that I would have probably thought the same thing back in 1994 when the internet was getting big, and I would have lost a huge amount of money.

I just don't understand. These guys once provided an invaluable service but now are basically rent-seekers and do not add value. Retailers have a huge incentive to fix this picture. Why don't they? Walmart has been handling money for years now. I feel like Amazon could easily implement this. Apple Pay could be doing this. 

Why is nobody doing this? What am I missing?"

**Looking at Consumer Credit to Savings Rate Historically**

Hey everyone, so an interesting trend I noticed around Christmas time was the rapid expansion in consumer credit at the same time that consumer savings rates were drawing down. One can easily see how this may be bearish, although some people mentioned to me it could be bullish in that it indicates strong consumer sentiment about the forward economy.

So I decided to look at this from a more analytical and historical perspective. It turns out that there was a big spike in this ratio that times almost perfectly with the past two market tops. Data further back than that is a little murkier since consumer credit was far less than what we have now and the interest rates were much higher, leading to increased savings rates. 

I did account for interest rates in the calculations so that the savings rate is more ""normalized"" based off the risk free rate (I used 2 year bond yields as a proxy for this). 

**My two cents**

Consumer credit is inflationary int he short term, but deflationary in the long term. Much of 2017's growth was spurred by consumers taking on credit risk once again. That is good in the short term since the economy grows based on consumer spending. But once consumer savings run out, that forces consumers to either tap additional credit to keep up their spending habits, or to decrease their spending, which results in economic slowdowns. This results in either a economic slowdown, or a bigger growth in credit bubbles, only to result in bigger drawdowns down the line.

Based on this chart, we can see that the major indicator is when the slowdown (or drop after the peak) occurs after a big spike in the consumer credit to savings rate ratio. Fundamentally, this indicates that consumers are having a tough time paying their bills and that companies will see tougher time growing revenue in the face of increased consumer spending. It is a natural fit for a timer of market tops.

Everyone can draw their own conclusions. All data is taken from FRED."
16,2018-04-13,haxamin,6,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

“Think of strategic investments and M&amp;A as playing a game of go,” said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. “In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent.”"

18,2018-04-09,setyourblasterstopun,0,This is the week for gains in the financial sector. DD inside. (x-post to r/wsb),"TL;DR: I think there is strong possibility of strong gains to be had this week in the financial sector. Buy in by COB Wednesday to take advantage, and exploit using $XLF options or $FAS.

Thesis: The financial sector is one of the most undervalued in the market right now, and as earnings season begins I expect the market to finally give the sector the attention it deserves. Reasons:

1. The financial sector is tremendously undervalued right now when you [simply look at ratios](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true). At 18.3, the financial sector currently has a P/E ratio that is not only the lowest in the S&amp;P 500, but [is in line with historical P/E ratios](http://www.multpl.com/), unlike many sectors right now. 
2. Earnings should be strong for a couple reasons. One of these reasons is that net interest margins, the difference between the interest a bank pays and the interest it receives, [has been expanding](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/jpmorgan-citigroup-wells-fargo-and-pnc-financial-are-part-of-zacks-earnings-preview-cm945379), possibly more than analysts have been expecting.
3. Another reason to expect strong earnings is strong economic fundamentals. The market has had ADHD recently with concerns about tariffs, $FB data usage, Trump tweets about $AMZN, and so on. Investors have lost sight of the fact that the economy is pretty strong right now, but earnings season will remind them of that. We have great job numbers, rising household incomes, high consumer confidence, and so on. These are conditions that lead to high use of the financial sector among both consumers and industry.
4. Another reason for strong earnings is this is the first quarter of earnings after tax reform. Enough said.
5. FAANG may finally be becoming passe. I realize as I am typing this that $NFLX is up 3.5% today (though on low volume) even though it has a P/E ratio around 232, but the market seems a bit more skittish around tech ever since the Cambridge Analytica news came out. Retail investors are being dumb and buying the bubble, but [big investors are very short on tech right now](https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/09/hedge-funds-turn-bearish-on-tech-giants/). (If you don't have access for WSJ stop being a pleb. Ask mom to buy you a few less tendies this week and get you a WSJ sub instead) [Valuations for tech right now are insane](https://us.spindices.com/documents/commentary/dashboard-us-select-sector-2018-03.pdf?force_download=true), and buying in right now seems to be typical WSB buy high sell low autism.
6. This week kicks off earnings season. On Thursday, [$OZRK and $CBSH announce premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-12). On Friday, [$C, $FHN, $FRC, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC are all announcing premarket](https://www.nasdaq.com/earnings/earnings-calendar.aspx?date=2018-Apr-13). All of these are forecast to have improved YOY EPS, and some of them significantly so. P/E ratios for these are respectively: 14.14, 20.62, none, 27.41, 21.09, 17.86, 14.57, and 13.06.
More importantly, one year forward P/E ratios for these are respectively: 12.65, 17.49, 10.72, 13.08, 18.87, 12.27, 14.04, and 11.14. These valuations are as close as you can get to a steal in this market.



How to exploit:

1. Trade $XLF. It's a high volume ETF that tracks the financial sector of the S&amp;P 500. Of the banks announcing earnings this week, its holdings include $C, $JPM, $PNC, and $WFC. I would expect good results among these banks to raise share prices among the rest of the holdings of $XLF. Simply buying $XLF is the safe play.
2. Buy calls in $XLF. Pretty straightforward.
3. Buy $FAS.This is a 3x leveraged ETF tracking the financial sector. It tracks all of the banks announcing earnings this week, among others. It has average volume of around 2.3 million shares per day at a price of around $65, so it's big enough that liquidity won't be an issue. This is what I'm doing.
4. Buy calls in $FAS. This is only for those who play Russian roulette for fun. DON'T DO THIS.

For any of these methods, I would buy in the next couple days. With today's gains, I feel like there are decent odds of a pullback. Look for buying opportunities. In any case, convert as much to cash as you can, and buy in NLT COB Wednesday, and you will see sweet gains by the end of Friday."

22,2018-05-11,daynightcase,72,Betting big on GOOGLE (GOOG),"I have about ~35% exposure in Tech.
NVID - 3%
AAPL - 7%
AMAZ - 7%
GOOG - 18%

I have been holding some GOOG shares since it was at ~840 and yesterday I added 6 more. 

I am not good at evaluating companies but when I look around GOOG is slowly taking over and there is still so much potential growth. 

1). Data - Google has so much data. It is INSANE. They know about billions of humans and their behavior, business, streets, pictures (with google photos) It is absolutely nuts. which brings me to my next two point (AI and Cars)

2). AI - we know that AI is going to be a huge part of our everyday life going forward. And with the amount of data GOOGLE has, they are on the TOP spot to leverage and make their AI the best. This isn't even an opinion right? FB, Microsoft, and Amazon doesn't even have fraction of data that Google has. And AI is all about machine learning, and the more data you feed, smarter it gets. 

3). Automobile- This is uncharted territory, no one has been able to penetrate and challenge the big car giants like GM, Toyota, Audi etc. Once Elon Musk was asked a question, who does he see as his competitor and his answer was Apple. I don't know if he was being ignorant or genuinely don't see Google as a major competitor.    

Google's approach to automobile is same as their approach to Android. They do what they do the best (create software and services) and let the hardware people make the hardware. Seems like they are on the same path with cars, they are creating the best selfdriving system and infrastructure and just going to sell this to other car manufactures, who already know how to build cars. And just like Pixel line up, we might see cars made by Google at some point. But the point is, how can anyone not see Google as a serious competitor is beyond my understanding. 

I still haven't talked about their new silicon initiative and IoT stuff. Its safe to say, it all looks very promising to me

What do you guys think about Google in general? Positive, negative or neutral?"
23,2018-05-07,cbus20122,10,"Today's Consumer Credit Report Revealed a Really Bearish Signal, Haven't Seen This Discussed Much","(See FRED Revolving Credit Data Here)[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/REVOLSL]

As some probably know by now, I've been following along closely to a lot of consumer credit data in the USA and also around the world. Today's credit release had a really interesting and bearish item pop up.... a decrease in revolving credit, IE credit card debt. 

This is interesting because at the outset, many would assume that a drop in credit card debt would be a good sign for the economy, but it turns out it has other potential implications for how people are viewing forward economic environment. Also, a drop in credit card debt means consumers are spending less, which leads to companies making less in revenue. In short, deleveraging tends to be more bearish than anything else, and this is a leverage indicator that rarely decreases.

**Explaining the Chart**

If you look in the FRED chart here linked at the top, I think it should be extremely self-explanatory. In short, revolving credit only decreases during times of huge financial stress. 

The last 4 times this happened all occurred only during recessions (the 2015 event was a data reset). It happened early in 2008, in 2001, in 1990, and in 1987. 

**Things may be different?**

Even though I've been notably un-optimistic about the future of the economy (6 months - 2 years out), this indicator is... a bit odd. The thing is, during other bear markets, it dropped below zero AFTER a recession already hit. Given, it dropped down a good bit before the big drops of 2008, but in the previous recessions, it hit zero pretty late on during the recession. At least to a degree, this seems to be more of a lagging indicator than a leading indicator. So why is revolving credit dropping so much, and is that a bad thing? 


**My biased 2 cents**

Obviously, form your own judgements here and don't use this in isolation to make any decisions. I think this is *generally* not a great sign. As I mentioned, a lot of consumer spending comes from revolving credit. If revolving credit is drawing down, then consumer spending is decreasing. It's good to know that consumers are trying to reign in credit excesses, but the fact that there is a need to do so (if that's the case) probably isn't a great sign, especially given our rising rates. 

In the 2008 example, when this crossed 0, we were about 15% off from all time highs. Currently, we are about 6% off all time highs. With that said, we should be aware that the environments are much different. We recently passed a stimulative package which made the current environment much different than 2008, so it's natural that we aren't down as much. We also are coming off an era of enormous liquidity and stimulus worldwide unlike 2008, so perhaps if it weren't for these elements, we would be down more than we currently are when this indicator went negative. Who knows, it's probably a moot point to compare eras like this, but I figured it's at least worth exploring the one example where the indicator may have been more of a leading indicator than anything else. 

Regardless, discuss."

# 

# 1977

**Insurance &amp; People** \- Insurance companies offer standardised policies which can be copied by anyone. Their only products are promises. It is not difficult to be licensed, and rates are an open book. There are no important advantages from trademarks, patents, location, corporate longevity, raw material sources, etc., and very little consumer differentiation to produce insulation from competition.


It is commonplace, in corporate annual reports, to stress the difference that people make. Sometimes this is true and sometimes it isn’t. But there is no question that the nature of the insurance business magnifies the effect which individual managers have on company performance.

Our experience has been that pro\-rata portions of truly outstanding businesses sometimes sell in the securities markets at very large discounts from the prices they would command in
negotiated transactions involving entire companies.

# 1978

**Investing** \- We paid less than 100 cents on the dollar for the best company in the business, when far more than 100 cents on the dollar is being paid for mediocre companies in corporate transactions. And there is no way to start a new operation \- with necessarily uncertain prospects \- at less than 100 cents on the dollar.

# 1979

**Operating Performance** \- On this basis, we had a reasonably good operating performance in 1979 \- but not quite as good as that of 1978 \- with operating earnings amounting to 18.6&amp;#37; of beginning net
worth. Earnings per share, of course, increased somewhat \(about 20&amp;#37;\) but we regard this as an improper figure upon which to focus. We had substantially more capital to work with in 1979
than in 1978, and our performance in utilizing that capital fell short of the earlier year, even though per\-share earnings rose. “Earnings per share” will rise constantly on a dormant savings
account or on a U.S. Savings Bond bearing a fixed rate of return simply because “earnings” \(the stated interest rate\) are continuously plowed back and added to the capital base. Thus, even a “stopped clock” can look like a growth stock if the dividend payout ratio is low.

**ROIC \- Return On Invested Capital** \- The primary test of managerial economic performance is the achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed \(without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry, etc.\) and not the achievement of consistent gains in earnings per share.

**Inflation** \- the inflation rate plus the percentage of capital that must be paid by the owner to transfer into his own pocket the annual earnings achieved by the business \(i.e., ordinary income tax on dividends and capital gains tax on retained earnings\) \- can be thought of as an “investor’s misery index”. When this index exceeds the rate of return earned on equity by the business, the investor’s purchasing power \(real capital\) shrinks even though he consumes nothing at all. We have no corporate solution to this problem; high inflation rates will not help us earn higher rates of return on equity.

# 1980

**Gains In Purchasing Power** \- Only gains in purchasing power represent real earnings on investment. If you \(a\) forego ten hamburgers to purchase an investment; \(b\) receive dividends which, after tax, buy two hamburgers; and © receive, upon sale of your holdings, after\-tax proceeds that will buy eight hamburgers, then \(d\) you have had no real income from
your investment, no matter how much it appreciated in dollars. You may feel richer, but you won’t eat richer.

**Indexing** \- Indexing is the insulation that all seek against inflation. But the great bulk \(although there are important exceptions\) of corporate capital is not even partially indexed. Of course,
earnings and dividends per share usually will rise if significant earnings are “saved” by a corporation; i.e., reinvested instead of paid as dividends. But that would be true without inflation. A thrifty wage earner, likewise, could achieve regular annual increases in his total income without ever getting a pay increase \- if he were willing to take only half of his paycheck in cash \(his wage “dividend”\) and consistently add the other half \(his “retained earnings”\) to a savings account. Neither this high\-saving wage earner nor the stockholder in a high\-saving corporation whose annual dividend rate increases while its rate of return on equity remains flat is truly indexed.

For capital to be truly indexed, return on equity must rise, i.e., business earnings consistently must increase in proportion to the increase in the price level without any need for the business to add to capital \- including working capital \- employed. \(Increased earnings produced by increased investment
don’t count.\) Only a few businesses come close to exhibiting this ability. And Berkshire Hathaway isn’t one of them.

# 1981

**Buying Great Businesses** \- Regardless of the impact upon immediately reportable earnings, we would rather buy 10&amp;#37; of Wonderful Business T at X per share than 100&amp;#37; of T at 2X per share. Most corporate managers prefer just the reverse, and have no shortage of stated
rationales for their behavior.

Many managements apparently were overexposed in impressionable childhood years to the story in which the imprisoned handsome prince is released from a toad’s body by a kiss from a beautiful princess. Consequently, they are certain their managerial kiss will do wonders for the profitability of Company Target\).

Such optimism is essential. Absent that rosy view, why else should the shareholders of Company Acquisitor want to own an interest in T at the 2X takeover cost rather than at the X market price they would pay if they made direct purchases on their own?

In other words, investors can always buy toads at the going price for toads. If investors instead bankroll princesses who wish to pay double for the right to kiss the toad, those kisses had better pack some real dynamite. We’ve observed many kisses but very few miracles. Nevertheless, many managerial princesses remain serenely confident about the future potency of their kisses \- even after their corporate backyards are knee\-deep in unresponsive toads.

**High Prices** \- For the investor, a too\-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.

# 1983

**Poor Industries** \- The projections will be dazzling \- the advocates will be sincere \- but, in the end, major additional investment in a terrible industry usually is about as rewarding as struggling in quicksand.

Last year, in discussing how managers with bright, but adrenalin\-soaked minds scramble after foolish acquisitions, I quoted Pascal: “It has struck me that all the misfortunes of men spring from the single cause that they are unable to stay quietly in one room.”

# 1984

**Stock Buybacks** \- The other benefit of repurchases is less subject to precise measurement but can be fully as important over time. By making repurchases when a company’s market value is well below its business value, management clearly demonstrates that it is given to actions that enhance the wealth of shareholders, rather than to actions that expand management’s domain but that do nothing for \(or even harm\) shareholders. Seeing this, shareholders and potential shareholders increase their estimates of future returns from the business. This upward revision, in turn, produces
market prices more in line with intrinsic business value. These prices are entirely rational. Investors should pay more for a business that is lodged in the hands of a manager with demonstrated pro\-shareholder leanings than for one in the hands of a self\-interested manager marching to a different drummer. \(To make the point extreme, how much would you pay to be a minorishareholder of a company controlled by Robert Wesco?\)

**Family Businesses** \- The key to a successful family business \- All members of the family: \(1\) apply themselves with an enthusiasm and energy that would make Ben Franklin and Horatio Alger look like dropouts; \(2\) define with extraordinary realism their area of special competence and act decisively on all matters within it; \(3\) ignore even the most enticing propositions failing outside of that area of special competence; and, \(4\) unfailingly behave in a high\-grade manner with everyone they deal with. \(Mrs. B boils it down to “sell cheap and tell the truth”.\)

**Large Cap Growth** \- And an iron law of business is that growth eventually dampens exceptional economics. just look at the records of high\-return companies once they have amassed even $1 billion of equity capital. None that I know of has managed subsequently, over a ten\-year period, to keep on earning 20&amp;#37; or more on equity while reinvesting all or substantially all of its earnings. Instead, to sustain their high returns, such companies have needed to shed a lot of capital by way of either dividends or repurchases of stock. Their shareholders would have been far better off if all earnings could have been reinvested at the fat returns earned by these exceptional businesses. But the companies simply couldn’t turn up enough high\-return opportunities to make that possible.

**Price Swings** \- Wild swings in market prices far above and below business value do not change the final gains for owners in aggregate; in the end, investor gains must equal business gains

# 1986

**Talent** \- Usually the managers came with the companies we bought, having demonstrated their talents throughout careers that spanned a wide variety of business circumstances. They were managerial stars
long before they knew us, and our main contribution has been to not get in their way. This approach seems elementary: if my job were to manage a golf team \- and if Jack Nicklaus or Arnold
Palmer were willing to play for me \- neither would get a lot of directives from me about how to swing.

Working with people who cause your stomach to churn seems much like marrying for money \- probably a bad idea under any circumstances, but absolute madness if you are already rich.

# 1987

**Remarkable Business** \- Our premium of business value to book value has widened for two simple reasons: We own some remarkable businesses and they are run by even more remarkable managers.

You have a right to question that second assertion. After all, CEOs seldom tell their shareholders that they have assembled a bunch of turkeys to run things. Their reluctance to do so makes for some strange annual reports. Oftentimes, in his shareholders’ letter, a CEO will go on for pages detailing
corporate performance that is woefully inadequate. He will nonetheless end with a warm paragraph describing his managerial comrades as “our most precious asset.” Such comments sometimes
make you wonder what the other assets can possibly be.

**Moats** \- Experience, however, indicates that the best business returns are usually achieved by companies that are doing something quite similar today to what they were doing five or ten
years ago. That is no argument for managerial complacency. Businesses always have opportunities to improve service, product lines, manufacturing techniques, and the like, and obviously
these opportunities should be seized. But a business that constantly encounters major change also encounters many chances for major error. Furthermore, economic terrain that is forever
shifting violently is ground on which it is difficult to build a fortress\-like business franchise. Such a franchise is usually the key to sustained high returns.

**Borrowing** \- Really good businesses usually don’t need to borrow.

**Franchises** \- The record of these 25 companies confirms that making
the most of an already strong business franchise, or
concentrating on a single winning business theme, is what usually
produces exceptional economics.

**Newspaper Business** \- It may not be coincidence that one newspaper leads in both
categories: an exceptionally “newsrich” product makes for broad audience appeal, which in turn leads to high penetration. Of course, quantity must be matched by quality. This not only means good reporting and good writing; it means freshness and relevance. To be indispensable, a paper must promptly tell its readers many things they want to know but won’t otherwise learn
until much later, if ever.

# 1988

**GAAP &amp; Fraud** \- Then there are managers who actively use GAAP to deceive and defraud. They know that many investors and creditors accept GAAP results as gospel. So these charlatans interpret the rules “imaginatively” and record business transactions in ways that technically comply with GAAP but actually display an economic
illusion to the world.

As long as investors \- including supposedly sophisticated institutions \- place fancy valuations on reported “earnings” that march steadily upward, you can be sure that some managers and promoters will exploit GAAP to produce such numbers, no matter what the truth may be. Over the years, Charlie and I have observed many accounting\-based frauds of staggering size. Few of the perpetrators have been punished; many have not even been censured. It has been far safer to steal large sums with a pen than small sums with a gun.199

# 1990

**Newspaper Industry** \- A paper that is frequently late, because of production problems or distribution weaknesses, will lose customers, no matter how strong its editorial content.

But as happens in Wall Street all too often, what the wise do in the beginning, fools do in the end

**EBDIT** \- Soon borrowers found even the new, lax standards intolerably binding. To induce lenders to finance even sillier transactions, they introduced an abomination, EBDIT \- Earnings Before
Depreciation, Interest and Taxes \- as the test of a company’s ability to pay interest. Using this sawed\-off yardstick, the borrower ignored depreciation as an expense on the theory that it
did not require a current cash outlay.

Such an attitude is clearly delusional. At 95&amp;#37; of American businesses, capital expenditures that over time roughly approximate depreciation are a necessity and are every bit as real an expense as labor or utility costs. Even a high school dropout knows that to finance a car he must have income that covers not only interest and operating expenses, but also realistically\-calculated depreciation. He would be laughed out of the bank if he started talking about EBDIT.

**Financial Alchemy** \- But in the end, alchemy, whether it is metallurgical or
financial, fails. A base business can not be transformed into a golden business by tricks of accounting or capital structure. The man claiming to be a financial alchemist may become rich. But
gullible investors rather than business achievements will usually be the source of his wealth.

# 1991

**Low Cost Business** \- In contrast, “a business” earns exceptional profits only if it is the low\-cost operator or if supply of its product or service is tight. Tightness in supply usually does not last long. With superior management, a company may maintain its status as a low\-cost operator for a much longer time, but even then unceasingly faces the possibility of competitive attack.

# 1992

**Forecasting** \- short\-term market forecasts are poison and should
be kept locked up in a safe place, away from children and also
from grown\-ups who behave in the market like children.

**Volatility** \- We will continue to experience considerable volatility in our annual results. That’s assured by the general volatility of the stock market, by the concentration of our equity holdings in just a few companies, and by certain business decisions we have made, most especially our move to commit large resources to super\-catastrophe insurance. We not only accept this volatility, but welcome it: A tolerance for short\-term swings improves our long\-term prospects.

**Practice** \- Practice doesn’t make perfect; practice makes permanent.

# 1993

**The Market** \- In the short\-run, the market is a voting
machine \- reflecting a voter\-registration test that requires only
money, not intelligence or emotional stability \- but in the long\-
run, the market is a weighing machine.|

**Missed Opportunities** \- In 1938, more than 50 years after the introduction of Coke, and long after
the drink was firmly established as an American icon, Fortune did an excellent story on the company. In the second paragraph the writer reported: “Several times every year a weighty and serious investor looks long and with profound respect at Coca\-Cola’s record, but comes regretfully to the conclusion that he is looking too late. The spectres of saturation and competition rise before
him.”

Yes, competition there was in 1938 and in 1993 as well. But it’s worth noting that in 1938 The Coca\-Cola Co. sold 207 million cases of soft drinks \(if its gallonage then is converted into the
192\-ounce cases used for measurement today\) and in 1993 it sold about 10.7 billion cases, a 50\-fold increase in physical volume from a company that in 1938 was already dominant in its very major industry. Nor was the party over in 1938 for an investor: Though the $40 invested in 1919 in one share had \(with dividends reinvested\) turned into $3,277 by the end of 1938, a fresh $40 then invested in Coca\-Cola stock would have grown to $25,000 by yearend 1993.

I can’t resist one more quote from that 1938 Fortune story: “It would be hard to name any company comparable in size to Coca\-Cola and selling, as Coca\-Cola does, an unchanged product that can point to a ten\-year record anything like Coca\-Cola’s.” In the 55 years that have since passed, Coke’s product line has broadened somewhat, but it’s remarkable how well that description still fits.

**Diversification** \- Charlie and I decided long ago that in an investment lifetime it’s just too hard to make hundreds of smart decisions. That judgment became ever more compelling as Berkshire’s capital
mushroomed and the universe of investments that could significantly affect our results shrank dramatically. Therefore, we adopted a strategy that required our being smart \- and not too smart at that only a very few times. Indeed, we’ll now settle for one good idea a year. \(Charlie says it’s my turn.\)

The strategy we’ve adopted precludes our following standard diversification dogma. Many pundits would therefore say the strategy must be riskier than that employed by more conventional investors. We disagree. We believe that a policy of portfolio concentration may well decrease risk if it raises, as it should, both the intensity with which an investor thinks about a business and the comfort\-level he must feel with its economic characteristics before buying into it. In stating this opinion, we define risk, using dictionary terms, as “the possibility of loss or injury.”

Academics, however, like to define investment “risk” differently, averring that it is the relative volatility of a stock or portfolio of stocks \- that is, their volatility as compared to that of a large universe of stocks. Employing data bases and statistical skills, these academics compute with precision the “beta” of a stock \- its relative volatility in the past \- and then build arcane investment and capital\-allocation theories around this calculation. In their hunger for a single statistic to measure
risk, however, they forget a fundamental principle: It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.

**Volatility** \- In fact, the true investor welcomes volatility. Ben Graham explained why in Chapter 8 of The Intelligent Investor. There he introduced “Mr. Market,” an obliging fellow who shows up every day to either buy from you or sell to you, whichever you wish. The more manic\-depressive this chap is, the greater the opportunities available to the investor. That’s true because a wildly fluctuating market means that irrationally low prices will periodically be attached to solid businesses. It is impossible to see how the availability of such prices can be thought of as increasing the hazards for an investor who is totally free to either ignore the market or exploit its folly.

**Sustainable Competitive Advantage** \- Moreover, both Coke and Gillette have actually increased their worldwide shares of market in recent years. The might of their brand names, the attributes of their products, and the strength of their distribution systems give them an enormous competitive advantage, setting up a protective moat around their economic castles. The average company, in contrast, does battle daily without any such means of protection. As Peter Lynch says, stocks of companies selling commodity\-like products should come with a warning label: “Competition may prove hazardous to human wealth.”

# 1994

**Forecasts** \- We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts, which are an expensive distraction for many investors and businessmen. Thirty years ago, no one could have foreseen the
huge expansion of the Vietnam War, wage and price controls, two oil shocks, the resignation of a president, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a one\-day drop in the Dow of 508 points, or
treasury bill yields fluctuating between 2.8&amp;#37; and 17.4&amp;#37;.

But, surprise \- none of these blockbuster events made the slightest dent in Ben Graham’s investment principles. Nor did they render unsound the negotiated purchases of fine businesses
at sensible prices. Imagine the cost to us, then, if we had let a fear of unknowns cause us to defer or alter the deployment of capital. Indeed, we have usually made our best purchases when
apprehensions about some macro event were at a peak. Fear is the foe of the faddist, but the friend of the fundamentalist.

**Intrinsic Value Versus Book Value** \- We define intrinsic value as the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life. Anyone calculating intrinsic value necessarily comes up with a highly subjective figure that will change both as estimates of future cash flows are revised and as interest rates move. Despite its fuzziness, however, intrinsic value is all\-
important and is the only logical way to evaluate the relative
attractiveness of investments and businesses.

To see how historical input \(book value\) and future output \(intrinsic value\) can diverge, let’s look at another form of investment, a college education. Think of the education’s cost as its “book value.” If it is to be accurate, the cost should include the earnings that were foregone by the student because he
chose college rather than a job.

For this exercise, we will ignore the important non\-economic benefits of an education and focus strictly on its economic value. First, we must estimate the earnings that the graduate will receive over his lifetime and subtract from that figure an estimate of what he would have earned had he lacked his
education. That gives us an excess earnings figure, which must then be discounted, at an appropriate interest rate, back to graduation day. The dollar result equals the intrinsic economic value of the education.

Some graduates will find that the book value of their education exceeds its intrinsic value, which means that whoever paid for the education didn’t get his money’s worth. In other cases, the intrinsic value of an education will far exceed its book value, a result that proves capital was wisely deployed. In
all cases, what is clear is that book value is meaningless as an indicator of intrinsic value.

**Sellers** \- sellers sometimes care about placing their companies in a corporate home that will both endure and provide pleasant, productive working conditions for their managers.

**The Importance Of The Float** \- Since 1967, when we entered the insurance business, our float has grown at an annual compounded rate of 20.7&amp;#37;. In more years than not, our cost of funds has been less than nothing. This access to “free” money has boosted Berkshire’s performance in a major way.

Any company’s level of profitability is determined by three items: \(1\) what its assets earn; \(2\) what its liabilities cost; and \(3\) its utilization of “leverage” \- that is, the degree to which its assets are funded by liabilities rather than by equity. Over the years, we have done well on Point 1, having produced high returns on our assets. But we have also benefitted greatly \- to a degree that is not generally well\-understood \- because our liabilities have cost us very little. An important reason for this low cost is that we have obtained float on very advantageous terms. The same cannot be said by many other property and casualty insurers, who may generate plenty of float, but at a cost that exceeds what the funds are worth to them. In those circumstances, leverage becomes a disadvantage.

# 1996

**The Keys To Geico’s Success** \- There’s nothing esoteric about GEICO’s success: The company’s competitive strength flows directly from its position as a low\-cost operator. Low costs permit low prices, and low prices attract and retain good policyholders. The final segment of a virtuous circle is drawn when policyholders recommend us to their friends. GEICO gets more than one million referrals annually and these produce more than half of our new business, an advantage that gives us enormous savings in acquisition expenses \- and that makes our costs still lower.

# 1997

**Stock Pricing** – You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.

# 1998

**Corporate Greed** \- CEOs who use variations of these scoring schemes in real life tend to become addicted to the games they’re playing — after all, it’s easier to fiddle with the scorecard than to spend hours on the practice tee — and never muster the will to give them up. Their behavior brings to mind Voltaire’s comment on sexual experimentation: “Once a philosopher, twice a pervert.”

# 1999

**Reason** \- Berkshire will someday have opportunities to deploy major amounts of cash in equity markets — we are confident of that. But, as the song goes, “Who knows where or when?” Meanwhile, if anyone starts explaining to you what is going on in the truly\-manic portions of this “enchanted” market, you might remember still another line of song: “Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.”

# 2000

**Analysing Mistakes** \- agonizing over errors is a mistake. But acknowledging and analyzing them can be useful, though that practice is rare in corporate boardrooms. There, Charlie and I have almost never witnessed a candid post\-mortem of a failed decision, particularly one involving an acquisition. A notable exception to this never\-look\-back approach is that of The Washington Post Company, which unfailingly and objectively reviews its acquisitions three years after they are made. Elsewhere, triumphs are trumpeted, but dumb decisions either get no follow\-up or are rationalized.

# 2001

**Incredible Management** \- Our managerial crew is exceptionally enthusiastic about the company and wanted to participate in the purchase. Therefore, we arranged for 55 members of the MiTek team to buy 10&amp;#37; of the company, with each putting up a minimum of $100,000 in cash. Many borrowed money so they could participate. As they would not be if they had options, all of these managers are true owners. They face the downside of decisions as well as the upside. They incur a cost of capital. And they cannot replace their stakes: What they paid is what they live with.

**Longevity** \- In December, Frank Rooney called to tell me H.H. Brown was buying the inventory and trademarks of Acme Boot for $700,000. That sounds like small potatoes. But ñ would you believe it? ñ Acme was the second purchase of P&amp;R, an acquisition that took place just before I left Graham\-Newman in the spring of 1956. The price was $3.2 million, part of it again paid with non\-interest bearing notes, for a business with sales of $7 million. After P&amp;R merged with Northwest, Acme grew to be the worlds largest bootmaker, delivering annual profits many multiples of what the company had cost P&amp;R. But the business eventually hit the skids and never recovered, and that resulted in our purchasing Acmes remnants. In the frontispiece to Security Analysis, Ben Graham and Dave Dodd quoted Horace: ìMany shall be restored that now are fallen and many shall fall that are now in honor. Fifty\-two years after I first read those lines, my appreciation for what they say about business and investments continues to grow.

# 2002

**Cost Conciousness** \- We cherish cost\-consciousness at Berkshire. Our model is the widow who went to the local newspaper to place an obituary notice. Told there was a 25\-cents\-a\-word charge, she requested “Fred Brown died.” She was then informed there was a seven\-word minimum. “Okay” the bereaved woman replied, “make it ‘Fred Brown died, golf clubs for sale’.”

# 2003

**Derivitives Business** \- But closing down a derivatives business is easier said than done. It will be a great many years before we are totally out of this operation \(though we reduce our exposure daily\). In fact, the reinsurance and derivatives businesses are similar: Like Hell, both are easy to enter and almost impossible to exit.

# 2004

**Index Funds** \- Over the 35 years, American business has delivered terrific results. It should therefore have been easy for investors to earn juicy returns: All they had to do was piggyback Corporate America in a diversified, low\-expense way. An index fund that they never touched would have done the job. Instead many investors have had experiences ranging from mediocre to disastrous. There have been three primary causes: first, high costs, usually because investors traded excessively or spent far too much on investment management; second, portfolio decisions based on tips and fads rather than on thoughtful, quantified evaluation of businesses; and third, a start\-and\-stop approach to the market marked by untimely entries \(after an advance has been long underway\) and exits \(after periods of stagnation or decline\). Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies. And if they insist on trying to time their participation in equities, they should try to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful.

Long\-Term Expenses \- Naturally, a business that follows a no\-layoff policy must be especially careful to avoid overstaffing when times are good. Thirty years ago Tom Murphy, then CEO of Cap Cities, drove this point home to me with a hypothetical tale about an employee who asked his boss for permission to hire an assistant. The employee assumed that adding $20,000 to the annual payroll would be inconsequential. But his boss told him the proposal should be evaluated as a $3 million decision, given that an additional person would probably cost at least that amount over his lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits and other expenses \(more people, more toilet paper\). And unless the company fell on very hard times, the employee added would be unlikely to be dismissed, however marginal his contribution to the business.

**Low\-Coat Strategy** \- Another way to prosper in a commodity\-type business is to be the low\-cost operator. Among auto insurers operating on a broad scale, GEICO holds that cherished title. For NICO, as we have seen, an ebb and\-flow business model makes sense. But a company holding a low\-cost advantage must pursue an unrelenting foot\-to\-the\-floor strategy. And that’s just what we do at GEICO.

# 2005

**Derivatives Business** \- Long ago, Mark Twain said: “A man who tries to carry a cat home by its tail will learn a lesson that can be learned in no other way.” If Twain were around now, he might try winding up a derivatives business. After a few days, he would opt for cats.

**Damage To Brand** \- If a management makes bad decisions in order to hit short\-term earnings targets, and consequently gets behind the eight\-ball in terms of costs, customer satisfaction or brand strength, no amount of subsequent brilliance will overcome the damage that has been inflicted.

The Importance Of A CEO \- It’s hard to overemphasize the importance of who is CEO of a company. Before Jim Kilts arrived at Gillette in 2001, the company was struggling, having particularly suffered from capital\-allocation blunders. In the major example, Gillette’s acquisition of Duracell cost Gillette shareholders billions of dollars, a loss never made visible by conventional accounting. Quite simply, what Gillette received in business value in this acquisition was not equivalent to what it gave up. \(Amazingly, this most fundamental of yardsticks is almost always ignored by both managements and their investment bankers when acquisitions are under discussion.\)

**CEO Pay** \- Getting fired can produce a particularly bountiful payday for a CEO. Indeed, he can “earn” more in that single day, while cleaning out his desk, than an American worker earns in a lifetime of cleaning toilets. Forget the old maxim about nothing succeeding like success: Today, in the executive suite, the all\-too\-prevalent rule is that nothing succeeds like failure.

# 2006

**Managerial Brilliance And Bad Businesses** \- When an industry’s underlying economics are crumbling, talented management may slow the rate of decline. Eventually, though, eroding fundamentals will overwhelm managerial brilliance. \(As a wise friend told me long ago, “If you want to get a reputation as a good businessman, be sure to get into a good business.”\) And fundamentals are definitely eroding in the newspaper industry, a trend that has caused the profits of our Buffalo News to decline. The skid will almost certainly continue.

**The Ideal Investor** \- Over time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things. A single, big mistake could wipe out a long string of successes. We therefore need someone genetically programmed to recognize and avoid serious risks, including those never before encountered. Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies cannot be spotted by use of the models commonly employed today by financial institutions. Temperament is also important. Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a keen understanding of both human and institutional behavior is vital to long\-term investment success. I’ve seen a lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues. Finally, we have a special problem to consider: our ability to keep the person we hire. Being able to list Berkshire on a resume would materially enhance the marketability of an investment manager. We will need, therefore, to be sure we can retain our choice, even though he or she could leave and make much more money elsewhere. 17 There are surely people who fit what we need, but they may be hard to identify. In 1979, Jack Byrne and I felt we had found such a person in Lou Simpson. We then made an arrangement with him whereby he would be paid well for sustained over\-performance. Under this deal, he has earned large amounts. Lou, however, could have left us long ago to manage far greater sums on more advantageous terms. If money alone had been the object, that’s exactly what he would have done. But Lou never considered such a move. We need to find a younger person or two made of the same stuff.

**Rip Off Hedge Funds** \- In 2006, promises and fees hit new highs. A flood of money went from institutional investors to the 2\-and\-20 crowd. For those innocent of this arrangement, let me explain: It’s a lopsided system whereby 2&amp;#37; of your principal is paid each year to the manager even if he accomplishes nothing – or, for that matter, loses you a bundle – and, additionally, 20&amp;#37; of your profit is paid to him if he succeeds, even if his success is due simply to a rising tide. For example, a manager who achieves a gross return of 10&amp;#37; in a year will keep 3.6 percentage points – two points off the top plus 20&amp;#37; of the residual 8 points – leaving only 6.4 percentage points for his investors. On a $3 billion fund, this 6.4&amp;#37; net “performance” will deliver the manager a cool $108 million. He will receive this bonanza even though an index fund might have returned 15&amp;#37; to investors in the same period and charged them only a token fee. 21 The inexorable math of this grotesque arrangement is certain to make the Gotrocks family poorer over time than it would have been had it never heard of these “hyper\-helpers.” Even so, the 2\-and\-20 action spreads. Its effects bring to mind the old adage: When someone with experience proposes a deal to someone with money, too often the fellow with money ends up with the experience, and the fellow with experience ends up with the money.

# 2007

**Sustainable Competitive Advantage** \- But if a business requires a superstar to produce great results, the business itself cannot be deemed great. A medical partnership led by your area’s premier brain surgeon may enjoy outsized and growing earnings, but that tells little about its future. The partnership’s moat will go when the surgeon goes. You can count, though, on the moat of the Mayo Clinic to endure, even though you can’t name its CEO.

**Capex** \- A company that needs large increases in capital to engender its growth may well prove to be a satisfactory investment. There is, to follow through on our example, nothing shabby about earning $82 million pre\-tax on $400 million of net tangible assets. But that equation for the owner is vastly different from the See’s situation. It’s far better to have an ever\-increasing stream of earnings with virtually no major capital requirements. Ask Microsoft or Google.

# 2008

**Buying Stocks** \- Whether we’re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.

**Buyer Of Family Business** \- Our long\-avowed goal is to be the “buyer of choice” for businesses – particularly those built and owned by families. The way to achieve this goal is to deserve it. That means we must keep our promises; avoid leveraging up acquired businesses; grant unusual autonomy to our managers; and hold the purchased companies through thick and thin \(though we prefer thick and thicker.

Our record matches our rhetoric. Most buyers competing against us, however, follow a different path. For them, acquisitions are “merchandise.” Before the ink dries on their purchase contracts, these operators are contemplating “exit strategies.” We have a decided advantage, therefore, when we encounter sellers who truly care about the future of their businesses.

**Cash In Crisis** \- Clinging to cash equivalents or long\-term government bonds at present yields is almost certainly a terrible policy if continued for long. Holders of these instruments, of course, have felt increasingly comfortable – in fact, almost smug – in following this policy as financial turmoil has mounted. They regard their judgment confirmed when they hear commentators proclaim “cash is king,” even though that wonderful cash is earning close to nothing and will surely find its purchasing power eroded over time.

**Derivitives** \- Derivatives are dangerous. They have dramatically increased the leverage and risks in our financial system. They have made it almost impossible for investors to understand and analyze our largest commercial banks and investment banks. They allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in massive misstatements of earnings for years. So indecipherable were Freddie and Fannie that their federal regulator, OFHEO, whose more than 100 employees had no job except the oversight of these two institutions, totally missed their cooking of the books

**Improved “transparency”** – a favorite remedy of politicians, commentators and financial regulators for averting future train wrecks – won’t cure the problems that derivatives pose. I know of no reporting mechanism that would come close to describing and measuring the risks in a huge and complex portfolio of derivatives. Auditors can’t audit these contracts, and regulators can’t regulate them. When I read the pages of “disclosure” in 10\-Ks of companies that are entangled with these instruments, all I end up knowing is that I don’t know what is going on in their portfolios \(and then I reach for some aspirin\).

**Black\-Scholes Model** \- The Black\-Scholes formula has approached the status of holy writ in finance, and we use it when valuing our equity put options for financial statement purposes. Key inputs to the calculation include a contract’s maturity and strike price, as well as the analyst’s expectations for volatility, interest rates and dividends. If the formula is applied to extended time periods, however, it can produce absurd results. In fairness, Black and Scholes almost certainly understood this point well. But their devoted followers may be ignoring whatever caveats the two men attached when they first unveiled the formula.

# 2009

**Climate Of Fear** \- A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance. In the end, what counts in investing is what you pay for a business – through the purchase of a small piece of it in the stockmarket – and what that business earns in the succeeding decade or two.

# 2010

**Black Scholes** \- Both Charlie and I believe that Black\-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to long\-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our money where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that the Black\-Scholes calculations used by our counterparties or their customers were faulty. We continue, nevertheless, to use that formula in presenting our financial statements. Black\-Scholes is the accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would be accused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an insurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use BlackScholes values for the same contracts we hold. It would be impossible for our auditors to attest to the accuracy of both their values and ours were the two far apart.

**Buybacks** \- Charlie and I favor repurchases when two conditions are met: first, a company has ample funds to take care of the operational and liquidity needs of its business; second, its stock is selling at a material discount to the company’s intrinsic business value, conservatively calculated. We have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. Sometimes, of course, infractions – even serious ones – are innocent; many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap. In other instances, a less benign conclusion seems warranted. It doesn’t suffice to say that repurchases are being made to offset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholders are hurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. The first law of capital allocation – whether the money is slated for acquisitions or share repurchases – is that what is smart at one price is dumb at another. \(One CEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; I recommend that you read his annual letter.\)

**Future Of American Business** \- It’s just that sometimes people focus on the myriad of uncertainties that always exist while at other times they ignore them \(usually because the recent past has been uneventful\). 5 American business will do fine over time. And stocks will do well just as certainly, since their fate is tied to business performance. Periodic setbacks will occur, yes, but investors and managers are in a game that is heavily stacked in their favor. \(The Dow Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497 in the 20th Century, a staggering 17,320&amp;#37; increase that materialized despite four costly wars, a Great Depression and many recessions. And don’t forget that shareholders received substantial dividends throughout the century as well.\) Since the basic game is so favorable, Charlie and I believe it’s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out of it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of “experts,” or the ebb and flow of business activity. The risks of being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being in it. My own history provides a dramatic example: I made my first stock purchase in the spring of 1942 when the U.S. was suffering major losses throughout the Pacific war zone. Each day’s headlines told of more setbacks. Even so, there was no talk about uncertainty; every American I knew believed we would prevail. The country’s success since that perilous time boggles the mind: On an inflation\-adjusted basis, GDP per capita more than quadrupled between 1941 and 2012. Throughout that period, every tomorrow has been uncertain. America’s destiny, however, has always been clear: ever\-increasing abundance.

**Investing** \- Investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike — The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham

You don’t need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment returns. But if you aren’t, you must recognize your limitations and follow a course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple and don’t swing for the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick “no.”

Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don’t feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset’s future earnings, just forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate every investment possibility. But omniscience isn’t necessary; you only need to understand the actions you undertake.

If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase, you are speculating. There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of those who claim sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin\-flippers will win their first toss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play the game. And the fact that a given asset has appreciated in the recent past is never a reason to buy it.

With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would produce and cared not at all about their daily valuations. Games are won by players who focus on the playing field – not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stock prices, give it a try on weekdays.

Forming macro opinions or listening to the macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time. Indeed, it is dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important. \(When I hear TV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am reminded of Mickey Mantle’s scathing comment: “You don’t know how easy this game is until you get into that broadcasting booth.”\)

It should be an enormous advantage for investors in stocks to have those wildly fluctuating valuations placed on their holdings – and for some investors, it is. After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my property yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his – and those prices varied widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state – how in the world could I be other than benefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout\-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I would buy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming. Owners of stocks, however, too often let the capricious and often irrational behavior of their fellow owners cause them to behave irrationally as well. Because there is so much chatter about markets, the economy, interest rates, price behavior of stocks, etc., some investors believe it is important to listen to pundits – and, worse yet, important to consider acting upon their comment…

During the extraordinary financial panic that occurred late in 2008, I never gave a thought to selling my farm or New York real estate, even though a severe recession was clearly brewing. And, if I had owned 100&amp;#37; of a solid business with good long\-term prospects, it would have been foolish for me to even consider dumping it. So why would I have sold my stocks that were small participations in wonderful businesses? True, any one of them might eventually disappoint, but as a group they were certain to do well. Could anyone really believe the earth was going to swallow up the incredible productive assets and unlimited human ingenuity existing in America?

**Volatility** \- Volatility is far from synonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray. It is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier \(in both nominal and purchasing\-power terms\) than leaving funds in cash\-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors – say, investment banks – whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sell securities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near\-term needs for funds should keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.

# 2015

**Huge Institutional Investors** \-Huge institutional investors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index\-fund investor who simply sits tight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn, recommend high\-fee managers. And that is a fool’s game.

# 2016

**Automation** \- In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About 1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton\-miles of freight moved by Class I railroads that year totaled 655 billion. By 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton\-miles, an increase of 182&amp;#37;, while employing only 187,000 workers, a reduction of 86&amp;#37; since 1947. \(Some of this change involved passenger\-related employees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.\) As a result of this staggering improvement in productivity, the inflation\-adjusted price for moving a ton\-mile of freight has fallen by 55&amp;#37; since 1947, a drop saving shippers about $90 billion annually in current dollars. Another startling statistic: If it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947, we would need well over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. \(Of course, that level of employment would raise freight charges by a lot; consequently, nothing close to today’s volume would actually move.\)

# 2017

**Sound Investment** \- Though markets are generally rational, they occasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does not require great intelligence, a degree in economics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is an ability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to look unimaginative for a sustained period – or even to look foolish – is also essential"
25,2018-06-25,mlankaum,0,Bettium — Decentralized Analytical P2P Betting Platform,"**Today we’d like to officially announce the token sale to raise funds for our analytical blockchain platform for P2P betting, designed to combine the familiar features of online betting with unprecedented new capabilities, such as a built-in AI assistant, Big Data analytical tools and algorithmic betting. The platform will serve both amateurs and betting professionals in a unified ecosystem based on the blockchain with all its associated advantages: decentralization, reliability, transparency, scalability and unprecedented performance.**

&gt;*“The online betting market is on the threshold of tectonic change. Blockchain will revolutionize the industry, significantly expanding the user base by ushering in new standards for functionality and reliability that will radically change the way individuals interact with each other. The Bettium platform will present a cleaner, more responsible alternative to the traditional bookmaker, fundamentally altering perceptions of sports betting and encouraging wider participation from the community as a whole: bettors, players, advertisers and industry professionals. We intend to show the positive side of the betting industry, providing tools and algorithms that will allow even amateur bettors the chance to play like the experts. Betting today stands at the intersection of sports, technology and logic — and Bettium is the key,”* *says Alan Hunt, Bettium CEO.*

26,2018-06-25,Warpeous,0,Apple is no longer paving the future in tech,"Smart speakers caught Apple flat footed. The HomePod was a flop, with numerous reports revealing Apple cut back orders after weak demand. My biggest problem with HomePod was that it only supported Apple Music, not Spotify. This made no sense if Apple wanted to dominate the market. HomePod could’ve been another platform for app makers, like iPhone, Mac, and even iMessage which has its own App Store and developers.

Wearables are not the future of tech. Apple may be the largest watch maker, but watches are a tiny market, and that’s like being a humpback whale in a koi pond. 

Apple has dipped its pinky toe in augmented and virtual reality, having an app section for augmented reality and creating a few applications like a virtual measuring tape and a virtual ping-pong game, but they haven’t created their own headset to compete with Oculus or HoloLens. Now virtual reality is nowhere near where it needs to be to catch on as the technology still isn’t there and the price tag is too high, but even then, anyone who has put on a virtual reality headset will tell you how impressive the experience truly is. And yet Apple is moot on VR.

Apple’s investment in original content is a joke, buying Carpool Karaoke and hiring Oprah. Just like smartspeakers, Apple’s original content seems to be a lackluster response to what other tech industry giants like Amazon and Google are doing with their own original content. Amazon Studios is making well received content being shown in movie theaters, like The Big Sick, and Google’s YouTube is getting into original content with the well-received show Cobra Kai.

Most important of all is the fact Apple continues to drop the ball on apps that are data intensive in order to function properly. Siri require lots of data to be able to answer questions, which is why Siri sucks. Apple Maps requires lots of data to construct maps, which is why Apple Maps sucks. So Apple may be angling to take the higher ground by saying it doesn’t use your data, and that’s fine, but when data-intensive apps start to suffer, it may be time for Apple to take a new approach.

The butterfly keyboards on MacBooks have been universally faulty, to the point Apple has started a free repair program. The removal of the headphone jack is still being questioned 2 years later. The tablet market as a whole is shrinking. Android phones are just as good if not better than iPhones. 

Now Warren Buffett may have doubled down on buying Apple stock, and from an accounting view that’s an obvious choice. Apple is by far the most profitable company right now. But that doesn’t make it the future of tech. And when Apple picks fights with companies like Facebook, it’s probably why there’s no Instagram app for iPad. 

I’ve been watching Apple’s market cap for the past 6 months, and right now it’s the lowest it’s ever been, hovering around $906 B, when it’s usually around $936 B. Amazon is catching up at around $825 B, Google is trailing at $806 B, while Microsoft is lagging at around $760 B. Personally I find following market caps more fun that serious, but the fact Apple has flirted with the trillion dollar market cap but hasn’t passed it for this long while other tech companies keep closing the gap, it’s starting to look like Apple is no longer the groundbreaking tech company of the future."

28,2018-06-19,Severian_of_Nessus,1,Elon Musk just released an email stating that a spy sabotaged their codebase.,"This is honestly one of the craziest things I've read from a corporate CEO.

&gt;I was dismayed to learn this weekend about a Tesla employee who had conducted quite extensive and damaging sabotage to our operations. This included making direct code changes to the Tesla Manufacturing Operating System under false usernames and exporting large amounts of highly sensitive Tesla data to unknown third parties.

&gt;The full extent of his actions are not yet clear, but what he has admitted to so far is pretty bad. His stated motivation is that he wanted a promotion that he did not receive. In light of these actions, not promoting him was definitely the right move.

&gt;However, there may be considerably more to this situation than meets the eye, so the investigation will continue in depth this week. We need to figure out if he was acting alone or with others at Tesla and if he was working with any outside organizations.

&gt;As you know, there are a long list of organizations that want Tesla to die. These include Wall Street short-sellers, who have already lost billions of dollars and stand to lose a lot more. Then there are the oil &amp; gas companies, the wealthiest industry in the world — they don't love the idea of Tesla advancing the progress of solar power &amp; electric cars. Don't want to blow your mind, but rumor has it that those companies are sometimes not super nice. Then there are the multitude of big gas/diesel car company competitors. If they're willing to cheat so much about emissions, maybe they're willing to cheat in other ways?

&gt;Most of the time, when there is theft of goods, leaking of confidential information, dereliction of duty or outright sabotage, the reason really is something simple like wanting to get back at someone within the company or at the company as a whole. Occasionally, it is much more serious.

&gt;Please be extremely vigilant, particularly over the next few weeks as we ramp up the production rate to 5k/week. This is when outside forces have the strongest motivation to stop us.

&gt;If you know of, see or suspect anything suspicious, please send a note to [email address removed for privacy] with as much info as possible. This can be done in your name, which will be kept confidential, or completely anonymously.

&gt;Looking forward to having a great week with you as we charge up the super exciting ramp to 5000 Model 3 cars per week!

&gt;Will follow this up with emails every few days describing the progress and challenges of the Model 3 ramp.

&gt;Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful,

29,2018-06-05,Zafrael,2,You got an idea to investing internationally? Indonesia might be a right choice for you!,"Hi guys!

I want to encourage traders around the world that seeking investment on international market to expand their portfolio or one who interested in investing in Indonesia \(especially in equity\) and as well the one that have trade in IHSG or maybe you just interested about anything else about Indonesia, you are all welcome to discuss here!

Let me introduce myself. I am one of the investor who dedicated my time and one of my investment vehicle in Indonesian equity in Indonesia Stock Exchange \(let's call it IHSG \[*which stands for ""Indeks Harga Saham Gabungan"" or equivalently in english ""composite stock price index""*\] to the rest of my writing\)

**About Indonesia**

Let me introduce about Indonesia, one of the most oceany country in the world, an archipelago country where hundreds or even thousands of islands there, one of the developing country which rich in its natural resources, very culturally diverse, where we are united by one official language ""Bahasa Indonesia"". Population of Indonesia is roughly 260 million people, which made Indonesia the fourth rank of the most populated country in the world. In terms of GDP, Indonesia took rank of 16 \(2016 data\) which is quite big, a lot of business opportunities are available here. Compared to ASEAN which comprise Southeast Asian nations \(including Singapore who has rank 10 in the world for GDP per capita\), Indonesia is highly potential to beat another ASEAN country.

**About The Market**

Indonesia only have 1 stock exchange which is the Indonesia Stock Exchange and 1 main index which is IHSG, and some other index to group specific stock by its value, liquidity, or special feature like the green stock or islamic stock. IHSG contain 500 and more publicly trade company, it may be 50 percent who are liquid or even more, with average market transaction value equivalently averaged to US$734 million per day \(compared to Singapore Strait Times trade an average roughly US$970 million per day\)

Lately, our index is catching up from the previous drop because global economic affecting its movement, maybe other stock market just go up just like one in Indonesia. But the potential is there, many sectors are underdevelop

**My View**

I could say that indonesia has the most upside potential if I look from economic growth point of view. You could say just because I'm from Indonesia that means my objectivity would be biased, but as far as I know about the current country condition, the infrastructure development is fast and reaching through all over the country where small city would be connected each other, where distribution and logistic finally reach remote area, and there are also electricity capacity upgrade program to lighten up every city across the nation, and more good news, private companies are willing to participate in this program to support the government.

I will share my daily stockpick for Indonesian stock, and also i will help reviewing stock.

30,2018-07-28,Sk6776,0,"Review my business idea, I’m 18","I’m 18, still in school, try to be constructive in your analysis and please understand that where you see naivety it’s purely my optimism. 
My idea is to buy bad debt from small banks, finance companies and even pay day lenders and use data analytics to accurately predict how much of this debt is recoverable I understand that some may not want to sell debt to such a young company but hopefully others will. I also know that these will be dog shit loans I’m buying but I rationalize it by thinking if I pay 10p per pound of face value and I recover 15% of the loans I buy then it’s profitable. I will pay pennies on the pound for this debt as most business will likely want to get it off there books. I will also hope to try new tactics in order to get more debtors to pay like offering them the ability to pay off only 50% or 25% of there debt if they pay it aggressively like within 1-2 years. This is a tactic rarely used in my opinion as businesses can’t give consumers an incentive to not pay their debt and debt companies fear if they do that then they will not make there money back. I will only employ it with the people that the data suggests are very unlikely to pay. I hope to outsource to software technicians for the designing and building of my debt data analytical algorithms. COULD ANYONE WITH EXPERIENCE IN OUTSOURCING THIS TYPE OF WORK PLEASE COMMENT WITH A PRICE RANGE AND LIKELY HOOD OF IT BEING POSSIBLE? I will hope to start this business during university (London school of economics) and once I have the algorithm I will then start approaching financier businesses and small boutique banks to enquire about there willingness to sell me this debt very cheaply. I will then use the data projections and I’ll hire a few debt collectors to employ the tactics discussed above. I want to run an honorable business and I hope that the people who deal with my company come to see the exchanges as helpful considering we’re slashing their debt and we don’t employ dirty tactics.
I estimate I may need as much as £100000 to startup and so I hope to gain this through saved wages when i start working, friends and family and a small bank loan if I can get one.
I see my role as being administrative in that I will be hiring, firing, finding new tranches of debt to purchase, developing contacts in the banking and financier industries, and also pursuing possible legal cases where needs be through the use of a lawyer. 
In regards to the price I will pay for debt, I will aim to secure in the range of £200,000-£300,000 of delinquent debt for around £10,000-£40,000 for my first acquisition.
I think this will work in the UK market as the market is operated by 3 big debt purchasers/collectors who control only 40% of the market still leaving loads of room for startups.

Please give me feedback on any major glaring issues with my plan x it’s implied that all the necessary accreditation needed to be involved in the debt market will also be gained prior to this plan.  "
31,2018-07-27,mirawiel,0,anyone know how all these stock orders seemlessly work?,"
its blowing my mind away kinda thinking about it

ok so. i just put in a order on thinkorswim to buy 400 dollars of a pennystock (i think its gonna be pump and dumped tomorrow)

so the order is a 1 triggers next, automated order

1) buy 400 dollars of it

then thinkorswim has a cool feature where i can do ""first triggers sequence"" which means it will automatically do my next orders 1 after the other, each time one finishes

so the next order is

2) trailstop to sell all the shares when it drops -5% value. if the stock drops 5% value, it sells the shares and i lose 20 dollars (if it drops right away). or if it does pump and dump like i expect, then it might increase 50%, then drop 5%, then it automatically sells it for me, and i make 180 dollars

if i do a ton of plays like this, on say 10 pennystocks a day. i lose some. win some. pretty much i make 400 dollars for 4 hours of work researching my stock pocks the night before

anyway. my point of this thread is

it kinda blew my mind away thinking about how.... theres maybe over a billion people trading stocks in the world (or maybe less. but then theres hedge funds and retirement account companies that do the trading volume of 1000 people per 10 people working at the company with big computers that put in automated stock orders too)

anyway. my point is. it kinda dawned on me that

theres FUCKLOADS of trailstop / stoploss stock orders existing on the planet every second. and somehow it all fucking works perfectly

i put in this automated order on thinkorswim, and it automatically somehow perfectly watches the stock for me and watches when the price value goes up and down, and it perfectly puts in my order automatically as i specify... with no lag, usually, apparently...  

and that happens perfectly for the billions of other automated stopless / trailstop orders existing in the world at every moment

how the hell does the system work so perfectly. its blowing my mind. i take for granted that im able to put in this automated order and it just... works... 

how can these supercomputers do it.. i guess they do since it works... but kinda just blew my mind thinking about it

probably no one here knows. but one thing im wondering is

the computer that ""watches"" my price and performs my automated order. where is that computer?

does thinkorswim have their own computer that watches the price data, and sends out my order

or possibly. does each stock have its own computer somewhere, and trailstop / stoploss orders for that stock get sent to that computer. and that computer watches the price and executes all stoploss orders for that stock

im wondering just how the hell it is setup to work so perfectly"
32,2018-07-19,I_Go_By_Q,15,Is Nintendo's slide a buy opportunity? And a look at its competitors.,"TL;DR: I saw Nintendo’s slide, so I decided to take a look at them and others. I like Nintendo, but am more skeptical of the others. Thoughts on Nintendo, Activision, EA, and Take Two? If you have anything that may help me improve or understand more, please let me know.

[Data here](https://imgur.com/gallery/yOLUtyo)

I am young and getting into investing, and when I saw that Nintendo has slid over 20% in 3-months, I was surprised. I decided to look into the basic fundamentals of Nintendo and some of its competitors, if only to practice stock research. I decided to look at Nintendo ($NTDOY), Take Two ($TTWO), Electronic Arts ($EA), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Zynga ($ZNGA), Konami ($KNMCY), and Ubisoft ($UBSFY) (Nintendo, Konami, and Ubisoft are international companies, so I listed, and mainly looked at, their ADRs). I also chose to ignore Sony and Microsoft because both of these companies are very diversified beyond video games, so I thought that it might skew the data, even though Nintendo directly competes against PS4 and Xbox.

For each company, I looked at their P/E Ratio, Current Ratio, and Debt / Equity Ratio. Then I averaged each number, weighted by market cap. I found that for each of these metrics, Nintendo looks good based on P/E Ratio and Current Ratio, although its Debt/Equity is high compared to its competitors. It seems to me that Nintendo is acting more aggressively than others, but that is less concerning considering how liquid they are. The average Current ratio is 2.64, and none of the companies fall below 1, which is comforting.

These are my thoughts after looking at this information and the 3 month &amp; 1 year returns of each company:

I am surprised at Nintendo’s performance, as they seem very healthy and I don’t see any red flags on the numbers side. News wise, I can only assume that the slide is based people seeing a relatively weak E3 and a light holiday games lineup (though, with Smash and Pokemon, I’m not sure I agree with that). I see a successful new console, and I imagine they will continue to be very successful in the coming. In addition, according to MarketWatch, this year’s estimated earnings in $2.04 vs $1.24 last year. Looks like a buy to me.

For all of the other companies, I am surprised that they have all considerably outperformed the market. It has been a good year for video games according to sources like the NPD group, but seeing high P/E ratios, especially ATVI at 180+, is scary to me. On the games side, ATVI can lean on tentpoles like Candy Crush, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch, but I think that there is a real possibility that the new Call of Duty could fall short. I am not bullish on ATVI. For TTWO, I fully expect Red Dead 2 to do incredibly, but its release is definitely going to be a big swing for them. 2k games seem to be shaky, but will probably still perform well. GTA5 seemly can’t stop selling, as well. I think EA is in a similar boat with its EA Sports offerings, and Battlefield V should do better than Battlefront 2 did last year. These companies all seem poised to succeed, but I don’t know how long they can continue to climb like this.

That’s all I got for this. I really enjoyed doing this research and trying to understand it. Do you agree that Nintendo is a buy? Thoughts on ATVI, EA, TTWO, and the others? Again, I’m still new at this, so I would love to hear comments and critiques, I’d love to improve. What do you think?

33,2018-07-17,dying_to_be_vain,5,Omnicom's organic growth misses estimates as U.S. clients curb spending,"As the Reuters' headline says, [Omnicom's organic growth misses estimates as U.S. clients curb spending.](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-omnicom-group-results/omnicoms-organic-growth-misses-estimates-as-u-s-clients-curb-spending-idUKKBN1K716H)

&gt;Omnicom reported a 2 percent rise in organic revenue - a closely watched measure that excludes foreign exchange rate changes and mergers. Analysts, on average, had expected a 2.3 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet. New York-based **Omnicom has been able to offset some of its large customer losses in North America with gains in Europe, where organic revenue grew 11.2 percent in the quarter.** Organic revenue fell 0.9 percent in North America. In 2017, North America contributed nearly 57 percent to Omnicom’s revenue, while Europe contributed 27 percent.

Not a big drop, but notable that one of the ""Big Four"" advertising agencies is looking outside of the United States for growth. Europe in particular could be attractive as WPP grapples with the demons in its closet, providing an opportunity for other companies to get former WPP clients.

Or, it could just be that Omnicom's domestic clients are not seeing as much value in traditional market spend, especially with the rise of nontraditional technology-based advertising competitors.

&gt;Omnicom also faces competition from consulting firms such as Accenture (ACN.N), IBM (IBM.N) and Deloitte, which have built big marketing businesses in recent years through acquisitions.

Perhaps its just that these advertising agencies are finding themselves playing catchup to other data-driven advertisers.

&gt;Omnicom last week rolled out its data driven marketing and insights platform - Omni, aiming to battle the rise of internet giants Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O), which have transformed the sector by using data to better target advertising.

Competitor Interpublic announced the acquisition of data mining firm Acxiom Corp’s marketing solutions business just two weeks ago.

Either way, lots of interesting news coming out from the top marketing companies, and lots of ways to interpret it.  Omnicom trades under ticker symbol OMC, for those interested."

""While  current Ford Fusion production ends in a few years, we'll likely  continue to use the name because of its awareness, positive imagery and  value with consumers,"" said Mike Levine, Ford North America product  communications manager. ""However, it's too soon to speculate on what  that new vehicle may look like.""

He went on to emphasize that consumers are moving away from cars into crossovers, SUVs and hatchbacks.

""All  car sales are down,"" Levine said. ""We're going where the consumer wants  to go. They want vehicles with more ride height, more interior space,  more versatility. Customers love the Fusion, but look at how vehicles  are evolving. We're pivoting to new silhouettes, silhouettes that better  meet what consumers are looking for today.""

Industry analysts are watching Ford and its Fusion redesign with interest.

""Ford  is looking to spoil Subaru's impressive sales growth with a lifted  wagon,"" said Dave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at AutoPacific,  Inc. ""This type of car is really the anti-SUV. It looks to have all of  the functionality and utility of a crossover without the stigma of  hauling kids or groceries. The lower-than-an-SUV height helps with  loading kayaks on the roof and has proven to resonate with people of a  certain lifestyle. These buyers tend to be in very good financial health  and are highly sought after at the retail level.""

Yet some industry observers question the strategy of moving away from the Fusion sedan to a bigger silhouette.

""There's not a lot of sales volume in the sport  wagon. There's not,"" said Eric Noble, a product development consultant  and professor of vehicle technology at Art Center College of Design in  Pasadena. ""When Ford announced it was dropping the Fusion, three or four  other midsized carmakers danced. Fusion is a very competitive car. The  only sport wagon that has consistently sold well in North America in the  last 25 years is the Subaru Outback. And that's a segment of 1. So Ford  is going from a segment that sells really well to a segment that has  really never sold well.""

He questioned whether Ford CEO  [   Jim Hackett  ](http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/business/automotive-industry/jim-hackett-PEBS00033-topic.html) is exercising questionable judgment while bowing to pressure from  investors upset about underwhelming stock performance; and whether the  dramatic announcement to eliminate the Fusion sedan and some other cars  for the more lucrative SUVs and trucks isn't a shortsighted strategy.

Apart from the popular Ford Mustang, all cars are on the chopping block.

""Why  change a winning recipe like the Ford Fusion sedan? This makes no  sense,"" Noble said. ""The car is made in Mexico. If Ford can't make a  profit off the Fusion, there's a bigger problem.""

Industry observers have challenged the leadership of Hackett since he took the helm of Ford a year ago.

""It's  like Jim felt like he needed to make some major announcement to  convince Wall Street he was making big moves,"" Noble said. ""(CEO) Mary  (Barra) at GM has been very successfully doing that, making big  announcements. GM has been very savvy about looking really busy while  remaining firmly rooted in the conventional business.""

While Europeans sell and buy wagons, Americans generally do not.

Noble said word choice will be crucial to Ford in coming months.

""The  word 'wagon' itself is repulsive to 8 of 10 car buyers,"" Noble said.  ""Many of those buyers are boomers and (Gen) Xers who grew up in wagons  and never want one. Europeans sell wagons. They sell very low volumes  and don't call them wagons.""

In 2017, consumers purchased 209,623  Fusions and 188,886 Outbacks, according to manufacturer sales data. In  2018, Fusion sold 86,978 vehicles while Outback sold 90,978 vehicles.

Fusion sales have continuously declined over the past few years while Subaru has gained sales overall.

""Ford  adds way too much complexity with the Fusion. There are too many  different models, too many different kinds of engines, all-wheel drive  and front-wheel drive, hybrid or not. It's just too much,"" Sullivan  said. ""It prevents them from being as profitable as a Toyota Camry or  Honda Accord. It's time to pivot the Fusion brand into a Subaru-like  vehicle from a domestic automaker.""

The Fusion redesign will probably directly compete with the Buick Regal, he said.

Levine said no time frame has been established for the Fusion redesign or its reveal. "
35,2018-07-09,TimeTheRevelator,431,Simple momentum investing via the long-term moving average,"**INTRO**

I have been researching a lot of factor investing techniques, and have come to the conclusion that most of the factors investors use are wastes of time. Most signals lose merit when empirically scrutinized, and those that remain do not seem trustworthy over decade-long investment windows.

Except for momentum. For some reason simple momentum investing seems to be the one factor that remains consistent YoY, all for the simple reason that companies and economies that have done well in the past will typically continue to perform well in the future, and vice versa.

**TECHNIQUE**

Here's a simple method for momentum investing I've devised (IE: shamelessly copied from people smarter than myself):

1. On the 1st of the month examine the moving average (MA; the average daily closing price) of the stock market using [Vanguard's $VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) ETF combined with one of the many free stock statistics sites on the web like [BarChart.com](https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/VT/technical-analysis).
2. If the price of stocks is above its MA then invest 100&amp;#37; in stocks. If the price of stocks is below its MA then move to 100&amp;#37; bonds.

That's it!

**DATA**

Momentum trades using differing moving averages in $VT (post-2008 stock market crash):

**BACKTEST**

Here's how the 300-day MA would have performed against buy and hold for $SPY: [https://dailyreckoning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/5/files/2012/11/DRUS11-13-12-1.png](https://dailyreckoning.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/5/files/2012/11/DRUS11-13-12-1.png) ([**source**](https://dailyreckoning.com/a-better-way-than-buy-and-hold/)). That's a 15-year return of 74.3&amp;#37;, almost double the return of simply buying and holding the S&amp;P 500. BUT this return &amp;#37; does *not* consider taxes (see observation #6 below).

**OBSERVATIONS**

1. This technique is wonderful for avoiding massive drops to the stock market while still being invested in the majority of its gains. Imagine being completely in stocks in 2017, but completely out of stocks during the entirety of 2008!
2. It's pretty low maintenance. On average, the 200-day MA of $VT only trades 1.8 times/year!
3. **The longer used MA****, the less risk/reward/work.** The slower the MA is to respond to trend changes. So you're talking about less return and lower volatility. Example: when the global stock market tanked in late 2015, the 300-day moving average would have safely moved to bonds in August. In contrast, the 350-day moving average would have waited to sell until September, a month later, meaning an entire extra month of losses vs the 300-day.
4. **T****he shorter used MA****, the more risk/reward/work.** For the 100-day moving average of $VT, the number of trades since the 2008 crash balloons to 24, an average of 2.7 per year, with many years having 4 trades per year. And a lot of those trades are whipsawed trades when the market is really moving sideways, making you do a bunch of work that really isn't necessary, and some of those trades mean moving out of the market when it's going up, missing out on a bunch of gains.
5. The data above seems to show **the sweet spot is 200 trading days** (200-day MA). This seems to be a somewhat decent spot to grab the trend when it changes, but to not get too chopped up when the market spends a season moving sideways.
6. Taxes are the one factor here which makes this approach earn less money than buy and hold. You're trading at least once almost every year here, so you're almost always going to be paying short-term capital gains tax, which is a pretty big hit to your overall return. That said, a few years (2013, 2017) are trade-free, so you have the occasional long term cap gains trade.
7. Because of tax inefficiency, buy and hold does seem the ideal approach for maximum profit. However, buy and hold does this by leaning on your emotions. In the 2008 stock market crash you would have experienced single digit losses with a 200-day MA approach. Compare this to buy and hold with its 50&amp;#37; drawdown (intra year). Imagine the wonderful feeling of being 100&amp;#37; in government bonds while everybody else is covering themselves in sackcloth and ashes and going through marital stress.
8. The bond allocation is probably going to be [$VGIT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VGIT), Vanguard's intermediate term government bond ETF.

**CONCLUSION**

I don't think I'll use this approach as my main investment, since it doesn't take advantage of long-term capital gains tax rates, and thus has a lower overall return compared to simply buying and holding. However, I am strongly considering this as a major part of my overall portfolio. Perhaps 40&amp;#37; of my entire stock allocation. So that would be 40&amp;#37; momentum investing via the 200-day MA of $VT, and 60&amp;#37; in my regular buy and hold in index funds. \[Note: I'm young and still have many decades of earning potential.\]

**TL;DR:** Momentum investing with major index funds is simple, requiring about 2 trades per year. Once per month (no more! no less!) look at your favorite major index fund. If the 200-day moving average is below the fund's price, be 100&amp;#37; invested in it. If the 200-day moving average is above the current price, safely move this allocation into 100&amp;#37; bonds. Stick to your rule! In doing so, you will enjoy healthy stock returns while avoiding the majority of market crashes, sleeping better at night during major market turmoil."

I'm starting a youtube series on security analysis using Python / data science. It's completely free and doing it purely from the perspective of teaching. Maybe python is overkill but heck, i find it useful so maybe other people do too.

I used to be big into algorithmic trading, until one day, I looked at my algos returns and realized even though they did pretty decent, all the trading fees basically ate up big chunk of the returns to the point that there was no point in trading, and instead buying an index fund made a whole lot more sense. ;/

Since then I've been more active in the 3 fund portfolio (VTSAX, VTBLX, and the VTIAX). But started moving slowly into my own portfolio of equities. This is some of the automation I've been working on as personal project.

If you don't like excel, or don't like doing manual data entry.. you're the person i'm talking to.

What I plan to cover:

* downloading / cleansing / aligning data
* using python / jupyter notebook to read in, comment, and visualize data
* analyzing financial statements - and how to connect the dots with charts / graphs
* how to automate the whole thing so you don't have to do this every time 10q/10k comes out
* how to templatize so you can screen stocks much faster

Here is some actual data on the impact of the ""trade war"" (from the[ US Census Bureau HS State Data Series](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/index.html) as of April 2018):

**US and China Trade Activity**

* 2018 Total United States Exports to China: $42.3B (**up** \+7.83&amp;#37; YTD)
* 2018 Total United States Imports from China: $161.3B (**up** \+10.66&amp;#37; YTD)

**All US Trade Activity**

* 2018 Total United States Exports to All Countries: $540.2B (**up** \+8.82&amp;#37; YTD)
* 2018 Total United States Imports to All Countries: $804.5B (**up** \+9.39&amp;#37; YTD)

Even if you believe trade took a total dive in May and June (spoiler: it did not in terms of overall  numbers), those kinds of YTD positive percentages mean this is not the apocalypse everyone seems to think it is. But how can this be? Every day all we see is talk of tariffs and how the economy is going to start circling the drain! 

Because the tariffs are relatively small given the overall trade volume, mostly targeted, and highly symbolic. Unless you have piled all your cash into a single industry (e.g. own 100&amp;#37; stocks of only Kentucky bourbon or pork manufacturers), this just isn't a big deal. 

I get it, /r/investing. I am not a fan of the current political environment, and I understand the desire to link political moves to economic outcomes. It makes us feel validated about our political beliefs. But the reality is politics is sometimes just that - politics. It is symbolic. I work with trade data pretty frequently.

The controversial movie subscription service filed a shelf registration Monday that will offer institutional investors equity and debt.
Despite plenty of speculation to the contrary, MoviePass isn't going away anytime soon and, in fact, parent company Helios and Matheson Analytics filed on Monday to raise $1.2 billion to make sure the subscription service that famously sells 30 tickets for the price of one thrives for years to come.

The company filed a shelf registration that will offer institutional investors equity and debt, and Helios and Matheson CEO Ted Farnsworth tells The Hollywood Reporter that he'll likely access the $1.2 billion over the course of a year or two.

A portion of the windfall will be used to make acquisitions, and Farnsworth says he is in final negotiations on a few already, though he declines to name the companies he will purchase.

If Helios and Matheson is successful in gaining access to such a large sum of money when the company sports only a $69 million market capitalization on Wall Street, it will represent a huge vote of confidence for its MoviePass asset. 

Farnsworth, in fact, has been down this road before, having raised $400 million last year, also several times what the company's market cap was at the time.

""They've been predicting our demise for eight months and we're still standing,"" says Farnsworth. ""Now we'll have a big war chest behind us.""

MoviePass says it may reverse-split its stock both in order to raise money more easily and to make sure its shares are not delisted from Nasdaq, given they trade at less than a buck apiece, which is under Nasdaq's listing threshold. 

Farnsworth says MoviePass will have 5 million subscribers by year's end and will generate $600 million in annual revenue. Doubters say MoviePass is basically selling dollar bills for 50 cents apiece, though Farnsworth recalls that the same was once said of Amazon.com.

""I was at a conference with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in around 1999 when a headline referred to the company as 'Amazon.bomb.' Well, look who's laughing now,"" says Farnsworth.

MoviePass intends to make a profit by marketing films and other items, selling data and striking concession and ticketing relationships with theater chains that crave the traffic the service can generate — as it has been known to drive as much as 50 percent of the box office on certain titles, especially smaller ones where subscribers might otherwise balk at buying a full-price ticket.

MoviePass faces some new competition from AMC, as the nation's largest movie exhibitor launched its own service where subscribers get three movies tickets a week for $20 a month, but Farnsworth says that MoviePass has seen a 25 percent surge in new subs since then, probably because every news article noted that MoviePass was much cheaper — $10 a month for a ticket per day.

Farnsworth also says much of the $1.2 billion will go to its production company, MoviePass Films, as well as its film investment asset, MoviePass Ventures, which has thrown money behind American Animals and Gotti thus far.

""This is a game changer,"" says Farnsworth. ""Now they know that we are not going away."""

Machine learning and AI  would absolutely have impact on headcount reduction at a lower level. ER will see a significant impact of this trend as jobs for pattern recognition and data cleaning will no longer require an analyst. 

\-----

Howard Marks believes top investors can still thrive even as trading machines become more active in the financial markets.

""Computers can do an unmatched job dealing with the things that can be counted: things that are quantitative and objective. But many other things — qualitative, subjective things — count for a great deal, and I doubt computers can do what the best investors do,"" Marks said Monday in a note to clients entitled ""Investing Without People.""

Marks, whose firm, Oaktree Capital, had $121 billion of assets under management as of March, said computers can't do things such as meet and assess management teams, listen to venture capital presentations and look at buildings for real estate investments.

""The greatest investors aren't necessarily better than others at arithmetic, accounting or finance; their main advantage is that they see merit in qualitative attributes and/or in the long run that average investors miss,"" he said. ""And if computers miss them too, I doubt the best few percent of investors will be retired anytime soon.""

Marks is known for his prescient investment memos, which warned about the financial crisis and the dot-com bubble implosion.

The Oaktree co-chairman noted computers can help investors make more informed decisions, but they won't replace human insight.

""Computers, artificial intelligence and big data will help investors know more and make better quantitative decisions. But until computers have creativity, taste, discernment and judgment, I think there'll be a role for investors with alpha,"" he said.

Well there's a way to invest in the ""cloud"" and it probably a smart move. The $SKYY - First Trust Cloud Computing ETF has an incredible track record. This is probably the only pure play etf on cloud computing, and it has a seven year track record unlike any other.

The providers note that this fund offer exposures to the cloud computing space via a mix of pure-play, non pure play and Technology conglomerate cloud computing entities.

Presently the fund has AUM of $1.8 billion, and it's Expense Ratio is at 0.60%, and they've definitely earned their fees. Because since it inception, investors have had nothing short of a tremendous experience in this ETF. 

Here's a look at its performance to the end of July:

Year to date: 20.1%
1 Year:  34.71%
3 Years:  22.36% 
5 Years: 18.70%

Of course when you think of cloud computing, the first thing that comes to mind is Amazon Web Services (aws), and although the SKYY has 4.85% exposure to Amazon, they had managed to find other names that are active in the cloud computing space. The ETF currently has about 30 holdings, here are the top 10:

NETAPP INC 5.09%
AMAZON INC 4.85%
ALPHABET CL A 4.84%
EQUINIX INC 4.78%
SALESFORCE INC 4.73%
VMWARE INC 4.72%
OPEN TEXT CORP  4.70%
ORACLE CORP 4.40%
SAP SE 4.34%
F5 NETWORKS INC 4.33%

The cloud computing space had seen some serious growth over the last 5 years, currently estimated to be around  $180 billion worldwide, and expected to triple by 2021 to a market worth $554 billion worldwide.  

Definitely a space worth getting to know.

44,2018-08-02,zachmoe,0,Bitcoin UBS report,"On a standalone basis, using Bloomberg price data indicates that bitcoin's average annual return since the start of 2013 has been 216%. Comparatively, US stocks and IG bonds have risen on average 16% and 1.6% annually, respectively (the latter suffered from both taper tantrum and the more recent rise in US rates). Over this period, bitcoin has outperformed bonds by a big margin on a risk-adjusted basis, but only very modestly beat stocks. We use monthly returns and standard deviations to calculate the annualised Sharpe ratio for the three assets. We assume the risk-free rate is zero for ease of computation, and given that US T-bill yields were close to zero for the majority of that period. Bitcoin's standalone Sharpe ratio is 1.25, against 1.17 for the S&amp;P 500 and 0.49 for US IG bonds. These findings are unsurprising given the unprecedented rise in the price of bitcoin.  

We looked at how a typical portfolio would have behaved with and without bitcoin. As an illustrative exercise, we constructed two portfolios: 1) a US-centric 60% equity, 40% IG bonds; and 2) a more global version that includes 40% MSCI World, 20% MSCI EM, 15% US IG, 7.5% EM dollar bonds, 7.5% EM Local, 5% US HY and 5% gold. We then constructed two identical portfolios, with the exception of adding a 5% allocation of bitcoin, and reducing the weights of the other assets in proportion to their original weight. We used total returns and rebalanced our portfolio monthly.

Our results are interesting (Figures 13 &amp; 14). First, the clear implication is that adding a 5% allocation of bitcoin to our sample portfolios would have increased returns considerably, by 11pp annually, roughly doubling the overall return for the US portfolio and tripling that for the global portfolio. Second, the standard deviation of the portfolios would have risen substantially too, doubling in both cases. However, this was not enough to deter an improvement in the overall Sharpe ratio for the portfolios after bitcoin was added, albeit small in the case of the US portfolio. This makes sense given that the standalone Sharpe ratio for bitcoin was higher than both portfolios before inclusion, so even if there were no diversification benefits whatsoever, the inclusion of bitcoin would have increased the ratio. 

However, historically there have been meaningful diversification properties. Bitcoin's correlation with other asset classes has been, according to our analysis, close to negligible (Figure 15). This was also seen in the maximum drawdown calculation for the portfolios, which barely changed despite adding a highly volatile component. Therefore, adding bitcoin to a typical portfolio would have had a favourable impact on both absolute and risk-adjusted returns for the period considered. 

But there are also natural limitations, which could restrict the connection between the past and the future. The current market capitalisation of bitcoin is roughly $130bn (down from as much as $325bn in December 2017). As a purely illustrative exercise, if bitcoin prices were to increase at a similar pace as they have done since 2013, this would imply a valuation of $7.8trn by 2021, without accounting for the increase in supply which would result in an even larger valuation. Not only does this dwarf the market capitalisation of the world's most valuable company, Apple Inc, by almost 10 times, but it is also roughly five times the total volume of US money in circulation."
45,2018-09-30,mercfh85,8,Thoughts on this High Dividend/Holding Portfolio? (REITS + Strong Dividend Leaders),"So Im going to be making an m1 brokerage account (Normal). I opened up a Roth IRA With vanguard and put your usual boring ETF/Index funds stocks that I won't touch till I retire. Also pre-apologies of this being a long post.

HOWEVER, I did want to have something for the intermediate length term that I can watch and learn. I have my Robinhood account I put very little in (were talking like 20 bucks a month) to just play around with. This however is meant to just grow for the intermediate term, aimed at mainly doing dividends with strong companies for the long term. I wanted to have a piece of multiple sectors that I feel are long term plays but I wanted everyone's thoughts **(Suggestions are def. wanted! Im a beginner, this is just my feeling and some basic research i've done so im not claiming anything purely asking advice)**. Also remember this is NOT my roth IRA or 401k. This is something im going to be intermediately funding to learn more about the market and for intermediate to long term growth. I will not be putting all of my money in these or anything.

1. REITS: I do want some of these as they typically pay good dividends and are ""relatively"" stable, however the normal real estate ones don't interest me. This would probably not make up a huge portion of my m1 ""Pie"" but I do like some of these (Besides Reality Income Corp which is boring but strong performance). With interest rates rising I don't see this as a good buy right now....plus I feel like Millennial's probably won't be buying as many houses in the next few years. Just doesn't feel strong.......HOWEVER the following do feel like strong ones: 

* Data Center REIT's:  Equinix/DLR and Coresite all seem appealing, I know in 2018 they've hit a dive........but that seems like maybe the best time to buy while they are a little bit low. I know rising interest rates obviously will affect them...but with everything in the world going digital and companies storing more data than ever I see this being strong in the future.  (If you had to pick which ones would you?). I also feel like Iron Mountain fits in here too (as they seem to be a pretty strong dividend wise....but i've heard some shakiness in their long term strategy from doing some research).
* Industrial REIT's: As retail places move more towards online (Amazon/Etc...) this seems like a very strong buy and hold (Good dividends, and I think online stores and shipping are clearly more the norm nowadays). Prologis is the one I know is amazons biggest one, but i'd like to hear of others too. 
* Infrastructure REITS: Same reason as above, I only see this industry growing (as it currently is). SBAC and AMT are two that stand out (Although I don't believe SBAC pays out dividends, but it still seems like a strong growth option). I don't know much about the area but i'd like to hear of others.
* Senior Home/Health living facility REITS: SNH and VTR are two high dividend payers that I feel are pretty recession proof...I mean even as medicine advances health care facilities (especially senior health care facilities for all the baby boomers) I see are going to be even a bigger necessity. 
* Timberland/Farmland/Specialty: These are specialty ones, I like Gladstone Land(LAND), they've had 2 large farmland acquisitions (I file this under the ""people gotta eat"", plus they are relatively inexpensive). FPI has had some issues it seems. As far as Timber I honestly have zero clue,  Weyerhauser has been mentioned as being pretty strong...but im not knowledgeable about it. It seems like it'd be a solid long holding. However I don't know how in-line Timber is affected by a slowing real estate market (or what I feel is going to be). 
* Manufactured Homes/Apartments/Retail/Public Storage: Retail feels like it will be def. on a downturn, Im too uncomfortable about Manufactured Homes to want to invest in their REITS. Apartments ""feel"" like they may become more popular.....but I really have a tough time  knowing what their future is with rising interest rates. Also not knowledgeable enough on public storage (i've heard mixed reviews on their future).

2. Energy/Utilities: I'd like to have some solid high dividend energy stocks. Preferably some in renewable energy as well. However I am completely ignorant about this sector. Dominion and Duke seem popular, No idea on some of the ""Big oil"" companies. I'd like to throw in some in some renewable energy companies (Which Im sure are very low now since Trump doesn't seem to have any interest in them) but it's a matter of time (And might as well buy while they are low)

3. Tech: I feel like there is enough information out there on these and which ones are solid.

4. Bonds: No idea on these??? I think they would be good to have to diversify. I don't think they should make up a significant portion however. 

5. Other Suggestions: This is where you come in :) (Obviously i'd be pulling some from the Aristocrats)."
46,2018-09-27,Chill_Duck_,3,$AVEO - Aveo Pharma DD,"#**$AVEO – Aveo Pharmaceuticals**

**Overview:**

Aveo Pharmaceuticals (Aveo Oncology, for some reason they have one name for their company and one for their website) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing targeted treatments for oncology and other unmet medical needs.  The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe.

The CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs. 

Aveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC.


**Pipeline:**

With their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology.

**Oncology**

Tivozanib:

*TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved)

*TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III)

*TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II)


Ficlatuzumab:

*SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II)

*Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I)

*AML (Investigator) (Phase I)


AV-203:

*Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1)


**Non-Oncology**

Ocular Form:

*AMD (Preclinical)

AV-308:

*Cachexia (Preclinical)

AV-353

*PAH (Preclinical)


While they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor.


**Specific Drug:**

Tivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.  

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors.


To optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis:

VEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis;

VEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and,

VEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.


With that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this.

TKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.  

When tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application.

Tivozanib – P = 0.034

Axitinib – P=0.908

Pazopanib – P=0.354

Sorafenib – P=0.427

Sunitinib – P=0.002


As you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies.

The Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib. 

In Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions. 

For safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63. 

Preliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.  

Although preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients. 


**Current Market:**

RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC.

While previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor.

Rising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment.

Competition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.

PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in.


**Financials:**

Recently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&amp;D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.  


**Review:**

I like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.  

I do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold.


#**TLDR**

This stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.  It even has options.

47,2018-09-27,eslerjm,1,Facebook as a Sales Platform: The case against everyone else," 

Written September, 2018 by James M. Esler

Before you read this, please visit [This Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf2W9PferpA)

The following relates to Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries. This article is not designed to recommend a buy/hold/sell position on the company.

**By the numbers**

The company currently trades at about 11 and 22 times its Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) sales and revenue over the last 12 months (respectively). From 2013 to 2017, Facebook revenue and earnings grew about 51% and 81% on average, per year (respectively). From the perspective of discounted cash flows, if the market price was static (or worse dropped) over the next three years and the company achieved a 50% CAGR, the 22x earnings multiple will be reduced to 6.5x. If the company achieved a 30% CAGR for the following 3 years after, the multiple reduces to 3x. However, that’s simply 6 years of cash flows discounted, and for a company that will be around indefinitely, the current price-to-earnings multiple is determined more than 90% by the earnings *after* the first 5 years. This is factored in to the price target (not included in this article). Additionally, the revenue per global user is about $5.97 per user currently (not including Instagram, Whatsapp, or Oculus VR). The current revenue heavily leans on Facebook’s controversial Pixel feature, though as you will see below, the revenue structure is likely to change significantly in the near term.

**Capital Structure and Expenses:**

The company’s capital structure has been very consistent since its IPO in 2012. Facebook hasn’t used bank money – only $2 billion of long term debt in the past 3 years (paid off almost immediately). Assets have increased about 48% on average every year for the past 5 years. The capital structure relies on the retention of internally generated profits. The only other deviation from the capital structure was a stock issuance for the Whatsapp acquisition (2014) – since then, the company has consistently bought back every year, including over $5 billion in Q2 2018.

With a TTM profit margin of nearly 40%, the company should not pay a dividend to shareholders. Facebook returns 25% per year to equity holders, and has increased free cash flow 51% on average each year over the past three years. The business model does not have any inventories (ex-Oculus), so cash generation is simpler and purer than many other businesses (including Amazon) – this is the reason accounts payable is an insignificant figure (&lt;$400 M). SG&amp;A at 18% of revenues in 2017, from about 23% in 2015. R&amp;D at 19% of revenue, from 27% in 2015. These are the main drivers of current bottom line growth and will likely continue to be. Margins will like continue to improve as Facebook continues to automate processes. The decrease in labor costs maybe from programs being able to replace employees.

**Regulation:**

Many investors believe regulation will compress Facebook’s margins, saying that litigation on grounds of data practices and even antitrust will erode earnings growth. Such positions are hard to justify, since Facebook competes in many circles, most notably against Google, Twitter, and Amazon.com. Further, the company does not charge users any fees, so it does not have the ability to ‘fix prices’. Litigation would be protracted if it did occur, though simple fines are much more likely. The Justice Department likely will not step in here for high profile trials. As you will see below, Facebook Inc is taking large steps to enhancing Pixel and encrypting data points to secure user data.

**Facebook and the future of shopping**

***In the near future, Facebook will be a leader in e-commerce globally.*** This will manifest through use of both Business to consumer (B2C) marketing and Rich Communication Services (RCS). Facebook consistently is making the buying experience easier, more secure, and less expensive (both monetarily and psychologically). We are in the early days of Facebook being a dominant business.

At this time, Facebook has a total of 1.47 Billion daily active users (DAU) using only Facebook (not Instagram, Whatsapp, or Oculus). Whatsapp has about 1.5 Billion daily active users, and Instagram has about 0.6 Billion DAU. On all of their platforms, Facebook Inc has about 2.5 Billion Monthly Active Users (MAU), and there is very little penetration in China at this time. Considering these numbers, about 40% of the world (ex-China) is on Facebook. For another reference point, Amazon has about 30 Million MAU (0.5% of global population). Facebook has created a social experience that does not cost anything and users receive tremendous value every single day from Facebook.com, Instagram, and Whatsapp. The users are generally able to make significant purchases, do most shopping online, and will shop at the market with the best prices/products. Thus, if Facebook can prove to its users that it can provide a better shopping experience than other online stores (Wal-Mart, Amazon, Etsy), it will be able to better connect businesses and consumers on the platforms. The better shopping experience will likely come from knowing the customer in depth, using prescriptive analytics to enhance the sales process for millions of goods and reducing the potential stresses of purchase decisions. Once achieved, Facebook will monetize by charging businesses a small markup on each customer interaction, though users will likely never pay a fee for the service explicitly.

**Main Ecosystem**

To the untrained eye, it would appear that Facebook acquired Instagram, Whatsapp, and Oculus for more users and possibly synergies. A commonly held belief is that Facebook made these acquisitions to harvest user data to sell to advertisers. Seems that very few people are unsure what Facebook has planned for these acquisitions currently, let alone in the future.

**Whatsapp** – how does it fit in? Whatsapp is the largest rival to traditional SMS texting that comes standard on mobile phones (ie Android SMS, Apple chat). Whatsapp currently supports Rich Communication Service (RCS, see generations summary below), which allows large files to be sent seamlessly without compromise. Whatsapp also uses end-to-end encryption over wi-fi so no one can see the message outside the sender and recipient (not the service provider or Facebook either). The end-to-end encryption will soon prove to be the largest competitive advantage for Facebook as an e-commerce company and also will give users confidence that Facebook Inc is a good steward of their data. Businesses selling to Facebook users need to ensure that the sales process is protected from malicious actors (ie hackers) because sensitive information will be sent over Whatsapp, including forms of payment from the user, and products from vendors (such as airline tickets). At this time, there are 1.5 Billion DAU on Whatsapp, and many of them business owners, making a strong case for B2C marketing. Whatsapp for business simply changes your Whatsapp account to a business account and now you can begin marketing with all of your original Whatsapp contacts. Your contacts can then share all of your business information with others very easily and in one place. From there, Whatsapp provides you free chatbots to communicate with clients. Facebook Inc’s Messenger App has very similar features to Whatsapp, though Messenger has only about 1 Billion MAU since spinning off just before the IPO.

**Facebook** – how does it fit in? Facebook is a leader in data aggregation, analytics, and prediction mostly on consumers, but increasingly on businesses. The longstanding idea has been to be able to ***prescribe*** what users want before they even know, based on data from its massive user population. This is prescriptive analytics, and it is the holy grail of advertising – with the potential to revolutionize the shopping experience. To be brief, prescriptive analytics in the 3rd (and final) level of data analytics, allowing for conditional probabilities to determine each step in a given process. Thus, machines will put users in touch with businesses based on the users’ preferences, and in theory, the buying process should be very easy based on millions of iterations of the same transaction.

The two drivers of purchasing on Facebook: Facebook Market place and ads in the news feed. The market place (which launched October 2016) will allows consumers to search for products specifically and the feed allows vendors to push to consumers. In both cases, the consumer will click the advertisement and begin a Whatsapp chat (see link at the beginning of this article).

**Instagram** – how does it fit in? Very similar to Facebook above, while also using RCS very efficiently. Vendors show up with images and video advertisements in the feed and also in the ‘stories’ section. Users click on the vendor and can now communicate directly to the vendor. With Instagram TV (IGTV, launched July 2018), Instagram is attempting to add a YouTube mimic. YouTube currently has over 1.8 Billion MAU and has a large head start on IGTV, though YouTube is generally a destination for users, rather than a social square. Facebook Live is a very similar product: both of these ventures will be expensive in the short term as the company pays influencers to attract users away from YouTube. Interestingly, Instagram still has room to grow, since it is increasing market share every year from its rival Snapchat, which still has 188 Million DAU.

**Oculus** – how does it fit in? Hang out with your friends virtually. This brings a new dimension to ordinary conversation. The long term goal of the acquisition is *most likely* to have the experience of trying products before you buy them. Also, VR gives a stronger attraction to users getting on Facebook’s platform, since users will find it even more convenient to know what peers and influencers are doing. The VR market has not taken off– Oculus likely has years of sunk R&amp;D and talent acquisitions costs ahead of it until costs scale down. 6g has been rumored to support peer-to-peer AR/VR.

**Summary of network communication types (ie generations):**

SMS (1g, 2g)– short messaging services, analog and digital. This service represented the entire mobile phone market from around 1980 until the early 21stcentury, and still is dominant in developing countries. The 3rd generation of mobile networks allows for much enhanced Multi-Media files to be transmitted user to user.

MMS (3g, 4g)– Multi-Media Services for the transmission of images and videos. This has been prevalent in developed economies for just over a decade, and was made possible by larger network infrastructure that led to expense scaling. While this service is an upgrade to SMS, there are still shortcomings, including file size limitations. Often, images and videos must be compressed, which is becoming more common with continuous mobile phone camera improvements. 4g allows for improved wi-fi connectivity.

RCS (wi-fi, 5g)– Rich Communication Services for easier transmission of very large files. This generation was first created in 11/2016 and is very limited currently. Many network providers do not support RCS for problems with expense scaling (AT&amp;T and Vodafone do). At the end of 2018, beginning 2019, this service will become much more ubiquitous in developed nations, allowing for quicker, larger messaging capabilities. Thus, vendors will find it much easier to send “push” advertisements, products, receipts and consumers to “pull” large files from sites, vendors, and peers seamlessly. 5g may advance to make peer-to-peer AR/VR less expensive and attainable.

**Current sales cycle (in general terms):**

Suppose you are interested in buying a bed. You research online about beds.

The micro-decisions to make:

·  Where do you do the research and is it valid?

·  Price

·  Payment method

o  Cash

o  Credit

·  Sizes,

·  Interior design styles to match the rest of your home

·  What your friends have bought

·  What store to buy from

o  Online

o  Physical Location

§  Drive time

§  Sales pressure

·  Method, timing and cost of delivery

·  Complementary pieces (for each of these, repeat all above micro decisions)

o  Mattress

o  Sheet sets

o  Blankets

o  Bedside tables

o  Dressers

The current sales process (above) includes over 60 micro decisions for simply buying a bed. This raises a few very important points:

1.  Many consumers will avoid buying a bed and keep what they have, even if they are uncomfortable

2.  Mistakes can happen at any of the decisions.

3.  Psychological stress can arise from buyer’s remorse if mistakes are made. Also stressful if there was a missed opportunity (FOMO)

4.  Psychological stress can arise from avoiding the purchase and living uncomfortable

Machines can make the buying process easier by way of prescriptive analytics. Consumers will soon understand this is true because the true costs are the time these decisions take and also (most importantly) the *stress* of making all of these little decisions. The stress may come from inability to make decisions (paralysis by analysis) and/or living with poor buying decisions (buyer’s remorse and FOMO).

If you research beds online, Facebook (through its “Pixel” feature) will have popups for stores you can buy from almost immediately after you research . This technique is called ‘retargeting’ and is one of the largest competitive advantages of the Facebook platform. At this time, retargeting is very awkward and unwanted. Retail stores (and Amazon) get the majority of all traffic because it feels natural to pick something on your own.

The general idea of machine learning is to help us make all decisions easier. We are still at the beginning of machine learning – only a small fraction of buying decisions (both residential and commercial) around the world are handled by machines currently. *However*, as new generations find that all decisions can be made by machines, and that by this, the consumer has a more convenient, more efficient, and overall less expensive shopping experience, sales traffic will only be online. We are likely a long way off from this, though e-commerce growth numbers clearly show we are moving in such a direction.

**Future of sales:**

If you are considering buying a bed, you search the Facebook marketplace for vendors. When you find one you like, you can begin discussing the options through Whatsapp directly (as detailed in above segment). With its Pixel feature, Facebook Inc. will maintain advantages over competitors by providing the vendor with troves of information about you as the customer. There are hundreds of quantitative data points and several qualitative data points at the disposal of vendors and users right now, though the growth of these data points will rise logarithmically until a plateau stage (several years away). Vendors are strongly encouraged to make their offering as detailed as possible so that Facebook can create better, more personalized user audiences, and visa versa.

In the near term, the consumer will become more confident that his/her data is being properly secured (ie end-to-end encryption) and will enter the sales process increasingly from social media platforms/RCS providers where they visit each and every day. Prescriptive analytics will guide the consumer toward a fitting product; however, this sales process may not be prescriptive enough until the longer term. The coordination of quantitative and qualitative data points across millions of products will eventually lead to better fitting product recommendations.

**E-Commerce example: Amazon vs. Facebook**

Whichever company knows more about you will have an easier time getting your business. This includes your friendships, your family members, your socioeconomic status, your state of health, your demographics, your personality etc. Users go on Facebook to understand their world and friends better, which is a very strong value add that is showing increasing strength year over year.

Users go to Amazon for the sole purpose of shopping, which will likely be harder to maintain because users do not get anything out of the platform outside of purchases. This traffic-generation model may not be as sustainable as that of Facebook Inc. Amazon does, in fact, have many bolt-ons like Whole Foods, Twitch, Music, Alexa, etc. so that users are stickier. Currently, very few of Amazon’s potential sales centers make a durable profit margin over 3% (ie Whole Foods is still losing money). Based on many commentaries, users are indifferent to *where* they buy something, as long as they have the most convenient, least expensive shopping experience.

Facebook’s product has durability since the user’s peers and influencers (Instagram) are constantly posting things of interest to that user. Case in point: Amazon has 30 Million Monthly users, while Facebooks platforms have estimated over 2.5 Billion. To put that in perspective– monthly, for every 1 visitor to Amazon, there are over 85 visitors to Facebook platforms. Facebook currently has a 41% net profit margin (Amazon \~ 5%) with about $22 Billion in earnings (Amazon \~ $5.5). A big advantage for Facebook from a financial perspective is that it controls no inventories, preferring to act as a toll road for B2C transactions. Amazon, however, has distribution facilities, warehouses, and many low-level employees that have the potential to reduce long term profitability.

Amazon does not have a messaging application or social media platform yet. Facebook can meet the consumer where they are rather than having the consumer come into the Amazon store. Importantly, many vendors are not comfortable yet listing on Amazon, since Amazon owns the client, essentially, and can (not to say it would) cut the vendor out of the sale. Facebook allows vendors to simply have access to consumers and data to improve the sales cycle.

In summary, the purveyor that knows more about the consumer and can execute at the lowest applicable prices will win.

&gt; Ad-renaline rush  
&gt; **Amazon’s ambitious drive into digital-advertising**  
&gt; *Building a big ad business will help the firm to keep expandin*g  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  Print edition | Business
&gt; Oct 27th 2018 | SAN FRANCISCO
&gt; 
&gt; An award-winning series, “The Marvellous Mrs Maisel”, follows the fortunes of a woman in the 1950s who undergoes an unlikely transformation from a typical housewife of the day into a talented standup comedian. It is produced by Amazon and can be viewed on Prime Video, the e-commerce giant’s on-demand service. Since its birth in 1994, Amazon has starred in several dramatic metamorphoses of its own. It has pushed beyond retailing into fields as varied as electronic books, private-label goods and cloud computing, as well as online video. Now it is intent on becoming a force in digital advertising.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazon has a long way to go before it catches up with the giants of the industry. It has 4% of an American market worth $111bn, compared with Google’s 37% and Facebook’s 21% (see chart). But Amazon started experimenting with ads only six years ago, and its young business is growing fast in a rapidly expanding market. By the end of the year it will overtake Microsoft, a software giant, and Verizon, a big telecoms firm, to rank third in America, according to eMarketer, a research firm.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite trailing far behind the leaders, Amazon’s ads are having an outsize effect on the company itself. Its revenues from ad sales worldwide in 2018 could hit $8bn, contributing perhaps $3bn in operating profit—over a quarter of the total. Michael Olson of Piper Jaffray, a brokerage, says that by 2021, it is “highly likely” that profits from Amazon’s ad business will exceed those from its lucrative cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services. Amazon loses money on its core e-commerce business, but can use the fat profits from advertising in the same way as it has used the cash from cloud computing—to push into new businesses and countries, says Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley, an investment bank.
&gt; 
&gt; https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20181027_WBC623.png  
&gt;
&gt; Closing the gap between Facebook and Google will be difficult but not impossible. Like those two, Amazon has a rich pool of data about users which it can use to aim its ads, including information about past purchases, which product reviews consumers have read, where they are and their online browsing behaviour. Amazon has a unique advantage, because consumers who are using the site usually intend to buy things right away. Some 56% of Americans start the search for any product on Amazon.
&gt; 
&gt; That will help it to grow as brands shift marketing dollars away from physical retailers. “Trade spending”—payments to retailers by makers of soap, mouthwash, canned food and other household basics for prime shelf space and promotional offers—adds up to around $200bn in America alone. Amazon is especially attractive to makers of such consumer packaged goods. Brand loyalty is weak and buyers are more likely to be swayed by prominent ads.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazon’s ads will not appeal to all businesses. Firms that do not sell goods through the site, such as fashion brands, carmakers and travel companies, will not advertise there. But online video is one potential opportunity to attract more business. Amazon allows video ads on Twitch, its online-gaming site, but it could also put adverts onto Amazon Prime to win some of the advertising spending aimed at conventional television channels.
&gt; 
&gt; Allowing advertising on Alexa, its voice-assistant, and Echo, its smart speakers, is another possibility. In the future, when people ask questions of Alexa or order something by voice, Amazon could incorporate advertising. Earlier this year it was reported that Amazon was in discussions with Procter &amp; Gamble and Clorox about voice ads for their wares.
&gt; 
&gt; As it chases growth, Amazon will face three obstacles. First, it must consider whether its advertising will put off customers. Voice ads butting in to conversations, even ones with inanimate objects such as smart speakers, are potentially irritating. And subscribers who have paid to watch online videos are unlikely to enjoy sitting through commercial breaks. Amazon must take care to avoid alienating the people it spends so much trying to please.
&gt; 
&gt; Second, Amazon will have to balance its relationship with vendors and address potential conflicts of interest. Advertisers can buy space at the top of product searches or pay to sponsor products. In addition, some search results are labelled “Amazon’s choice”, which favour important vendors and advertisers, says Matti Littunen of Enders Analysis, a research firm. (Amazon does not disclose how products get this designation.) And as Amazon becomes a manufacturer and seller of more of its own private-label items, it will have to decide how much prominence to give paying advertisers and how much to its own goods.
&gt; 
&gt; According to research by rbc Capital, an investment bank, of 100 product searches on Amazon’s app, in only three instances was the top ranking result not a sponsored ad. Those were for three Amazon devices: two smart speakers and a Kindle e-reader. Makers of competing products will be unhappy if it appears that Amazon is favouring its own products on its site or discouraging competition by driving up the cost of ad space on products that directly challenge its private-label goods.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazon will also have to contend with a more active regulatory environment. In September the European Commission announced a probe into its use of data and whether it could use information about third-party retailers on its site, which are also competitors, to boost its profits. As the inquiry progresses, advertising practices could become an area of interest.
&gt; 
&gt; Amazon has so far avoided a privacy backlash from customers. “Facebook uses your personal life and friend graph to target ads. Amazon has a more clearly commercial relationship” with users, says Jonathan Nelson, the head of digital at Omnicom, a large advertising agency. But as its ad business grows, so will scrutiny. Amazon gives users little control over how much information they share for advertising purposes, which could violate new data-collection and privacy rules in Europe, says Mr Littunen.
&gt; 
&gt; As it gathers more information about people in the physical world, including their spending habits at Whole Foods, the grocer it bought last year for $13.7bn, its dossier of data on consumers will become larger and more personal. That will propel Amazon’s rise. Just as Mrs Maisel discovers she has a new talent for cracking jokes, Amazon has a chance to thrive in a new venture. Before long it could make the digital-ad duopoly a three-way affair.

53,2018-10-28,NEO-ETH-Domination,1,IBM to acquire software company Red Hat for $34 billion,"Here is the link to the article: https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKCN1N20N3

Bumped into this post on r/InvestmentClub


Below is a quick copy/paste of the article:


(Reuters) - IBM Corp said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire U.S. software company Red Hat Inc for $34 billion, including debt, as it seeks to diversify its technology hardware and consulting business into higher-margin products and services.

The transaction is by far IBM's biggest acquisition. It underscores IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty's efforts to expand the company's subscription-based software offerings, as it faces slowing software sales and waning demand for mainframe servers.

IBM, which has a market capitalization of $114 billion, will pay $190 per share in cash for Red Hat, a 63 percent premium to Friday's closing share price.

Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software, which was developed as an alternative to proprietary software made by Microsoft Corp.

Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Red Hat charges fees to its corporate customers for custom features, maintenance and technical support, offering IBM a lucrative source of subscription revenue.

Red Hat is one of the very few companies in the cloud computing sector that has both revenue growth and free cash flow, Rometty, who has been IBM's CEO since 2012, said in an interview with Reuters.

""This acquisition we are clearly doing for growth synergies. This is not about cost synergies at all,"" Rometty said in the interview.

The acquisition illustrates how older technology companies are turning to dealmaking to gain scale and fend off competition, especially in cloud computing, where customers using enterprise software are seeking to save money by consolidating their vendor relationships.


IBM is hoping the deal will help it catch up with Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and Microsoft in the rapidly growing cloud business. IBM shares have lost almost a third of their value in the past five years, while Red Hat shares are up 170 percent over the same period.


BIG BLUE

IBM was founded in 1911 and is known in the technology industry as Big Blue, a reference to its once ubiquitous blue computers. It has faced years of revenue declines, as it transitions its legacy computer maker business into new technology products and services. Its recent initiatives have included artificial intelligence and business lines around Watson, named after the supercomputer it developed.

To be sure, IBM is no stranger to acquisitions. It acquired cloud infrastructure provider Softlayer in 2013 for $2 billion, and the Weather Channel's data assets for more than $2 billion in 2015. It also acquired Canadian business software maker Cognos in 2008 for $5 billion.

Other big technology companies have also recently sought to reinvent themselves through acquisitions. Microsoft this year acquired open source software platform GitHub for $7.5 billion; chip maker Broadcom Inc agreed to acquire software maker CA Inc for nearly $19 billion; and Adobe Inc agreed to acquire marketing software maker Marketo for $5 billion.

One of IBM's main competitors, Dell Technologies Inc, made a big bet on software and cloud computing two years ago, when it acquired data storage company EMC for $67 billion. As part of that deal, Dell inherited an 82 percent stake in virtualization software company VMware Inc.

The deal between IBM and Red Hat is expected to close in the second half of 2019. IBM said it planned to suspend its share repurchase program in 2020 and 2021 to help pay for the deal.


IBM said Red Hat would continue to be led by Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst and Red Hat's current management team. It intends to maintain Red Hat's headquarters, facilities, brands and practices.

Lazard Ltd offered financial advice to IBM, alongside Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, which also provided financing for the deal. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP provided legal advice to IBM.

Guggenheim Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley were financial advisers to Red Hat, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP offered legal advice to the company on the deal.

""Knowing first-hand how important open, hybrid cloud technologies are to helping businesses unlock value, we see the power of bringing these two companies together, and are honored to advise IBM and commit financing for this transaction,"" JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.

55,2018-10-26,abeecrombie,1,"Understanding the SEMI cycle.MU, NVDA, AMD, TXN, $SOX","I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is. 

1) The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&amp;P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful

2) Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its  always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually  cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months  there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler  data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.  

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom. 

Happy trading

58,2018-10-18,tony905,1,In Depth look at Millennial Esports(GAME.VN). A Possibly Early Entry Point to Esports,"I've been trying to find an early entry point into esports.  This is more a risky investment as the company went public only last year and the value is very low(.10).  There are safer and more established companies that dominate the market right now and have very high value.  Companies like Blizzard(ATVI), EA(EA), Take-Two(TTWO).  All are great companies to invest in.  But if your looking for a home run type of company here is what I found for Millennial Esports(I hate the company name by the way...)

here is a link to company details.  I hope it works for people that don't have an account on the site...let me know if it doesn't

https://simplywall.st/stocks/ca/consumer-services/tsxv-game/millennial-esports-shares.

This company mainly manages esports events.  Creates mobile games.  and provides statistical data for other gaming company.   

Date 	   Revenue	       Net Income * 
2018-05-31	2.22        -6.56		
2018-02-28	1.34	      -10.14	
2017-11-30	0.82	      -10.88	
2017-08-31	0.31	      -10.06	
2017-05-31	0.37	      -5.52	
2017-02-28	0.25	      -2.40	
2016-11-30	0.24	      -1.84	
2016-08-31	0.21	      -0.99		
2016-05-31	0.04	      -1.13		
2015-08-31	0.02	      -1.12		
2014-08-31	0.00	      -0.72

The company currently doesn't have positive earnings.  You can see that lately the net income has gone down more and the revenue increased a bit.  The reason for this is that the company has recently shifted to mainly focusing on racing esports.  The companies main source of income in the past has been from running esports events in an arena they rent out in vegas.  They are still doing this today but they made some big changes recently.  The biggest one is buying ownership of EDEN GAMES.  This company develops racing games.  It made Test Drive Unlimited Series and V-Rally Series for playstation.  Now it develops mobile games(Gear.Club and just released F1 mobile Racing today with the company Codemasters).  It also has an exclussive game coming out on the Switch on Dec 4th(Gear.Club unlimited 2).  In acquiring Eden Games the company has said that its future focus will be on growing mobile racing as an esport.  Their game has recently been added to Amazon Go eSport tournaments and they will be using their own arena they have in vegas to run events.

Looking at the stock value.  You can see when it initally went public the volume of trades was very high and the stock raised as high as a dollar before crashing down to .10 where it sits now.  This looks like it was a big pump and dump.  But the stock has been sitting at or close to its current value for a while.

For a company like this it comes down to if you see any value in mobile racing as an esport or as a good way to generate revenue. 
 There last financial report was in May shortly after they aquired Eden Games.  The main source of revenue at this point was from game development and any revenue that gear.club(and old mobile game developed by EDEN games a couple years back).  The next financial will be at the end of the year.  The main source will be from royalties they make from the  F1 Mobile Racing game, gear.club unlimitted 2 being released in Dec, and development for new games coming out in 2019.  The value being so low isn't taking into account the potential future of the company.  So if someone is interested in investing in this company I suggest looking up past racing mobile games to see how popular they were and how much revenue you would expect coming in from games that Millennial Esports will be releasing.  And most of all if you think that racing games have any kind of future in esports.

59,2018-10-18,cbus20122,1,Have we ever seen a huge blowout in real yields?,"Real bond yields risen higher in the past year (after being negative for a long time). For people who don't know what this means, real yield is basically the rate of return on a bond vs. the rate of inflation. If real yields are negative, that means your money being parked in a bond or debt instrument is actually losing money to inflation if the real yield is negative.

Now, we've been in an environment where we've seen negative real yields for quite some time, but I'm kind of curious, have we ever seen an environment with extremely high real yields? I was trying to find some data on this but wasn't able to dig up much since the Fed's tracking of 5 year tips yields only goes back so far (a decent proxy for real yield). 

I'm mostly curious because I tend to think if this were to occur, there may be a lot of really interesting consequences, and I was curious to see if history had any points of reference. 

Just for reference, I'm not saying I think we'll see this happen, but there are a few scenarios out there that I think could potentially cause this even if they're not particularly likely. Those scenarios mostly being linked to the Chinese selling of their US treasury positions. Many people have brought up that they may do this as a weapon in the trade war. I think this has been largely debunked as suicidal for China. With that said, there is another scenario that would involve Chinese selling of US treasuries in volume which has already occurred in a minor fashion, that being to protect their currency. If we were to hypothetically see a Chinese monetary crisis, we would likely see China selling big chunks of their US treasury positions to defend and stabilize their currency. They did this in 2016, and have started doing it again recently. And no, it's not really a problem right now, but if there were hypothetically a full-blown currency crisis in China, we could get a really weird scenario where bond yields blow way higher in the USA without any actual inflation to go with it. Given, a full-blown Chinese currency crisis would cause a LOT more problems than just bond yields running higher in the USA, but it's still a really odd scenario that to me seems entirely plausible."

A Bloomberg Barclays gauge of average corporate bond spreads has surged to a six-month high since since reaching an all-time low in early February.

&gt; The big push into the bottom end of high-grade bonds was driven by the search for yield amid record-low rates following the 2008 financial crisis and unprecedented stimulus from central banks. Investors who were comfortable in A-rated bonds moved to BBBs, and those who were comfortable in BBBs dipped into high yield, according to Lyons of CreditSights.

October 11, 2018: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-almost-junk-credit-ratings/

&gt; Bloomberg News delved into 50 of the biggest corporate acquisitions over the last five years, and found:

&gt; -    By one key measure, more than half of the acquiring companies pushed their leverage to levels typical of junk-rated peers. But those companies, which have almost $1 trillion of debt, have been allowed to maintain investment-grade ratings by Moody’s Investors Service and S&amp;P Global Ratings.

&gt; -    The vast majority of the 50 deals—valued at $1.9 trillion collectively—were financed with debt.

&gt; -    This M&amp;A-fueled leveraging of corporate balance sheets contributed to a surge in debt rated in the bottom investment-grade tier and now represents almost half of the outstanding market, Bloomberg Barclays index data show.

&gt; “The rating agencies are giving companies too much wiggle room,” said Tom Murphy, a money manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “There’s been some pretty heroic assumptions around cost savings and debt repayments laid out by some borrowers involved in mergers.”

&gt; Take Campbell Soup Co. The company borrowed more than $6 billion in the past year to buy Snyder’s-Lance Inc., the maker of pretzels and other snacks. The acquisition more than doubled the company’s debt load to nearly $10 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company now has more than 5 times as much debt as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure known as Ebitda, according to Moody’s.

&gt; While ratings firms evaluate a number of criteria, a company with leverage that high would be considered junk if judged on that metric alone. For example, two Campbell Soup competitors, Pinnacle Foods Inc. and Lamb Weston Holdings Inc., have lower leverage and are rated below investment-grade. But Moody’s and S&amp;P kept Campbell at investment-grade, saying they expected the merged food company to generate enough revenue to pay down its debt quickly.

TL;DR: High levels of corporate debt, and credit rating agencies might be slow with updating the ratings (07-08' mortgage-backed securities' credit ratings anyone?)."

Alkermes has two big FDA deadlines and events in the upcoming months which will be the focus of this write up.  The first is ALKS 5461 for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder with the FDA advisory committee discussing the NDA application for the drug candidate on November 1st as well as a PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  The second is ALKS 4230 for treatment of Solid Tumors, where they are reporting Phase I initial data in the second half of 2018.  I will be setting 2 dates for this write up to remind investors of the Advisory Meeting/data presentation sometime in the next 2 months, as well as the PDUFA date of January 31, 2019.  With multiple catalysts in the pipeline in the next 3 months, Alkermes is an exciting company to watch.


**Specific Drugs:**

**ALKS 5461**

AKLS 5461, buprenorphine/samidorphan, is a k-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist which functions as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).  The buprenorphine is a partial agonist of µ-opioid receptors (MOR), antagonist of the KOR, as well as a slight antagonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and a weak agonist of the nociception receptor (NOP).  Samidorphan on the other hand is a preferential antagonist of the MOR, allowing for the combination of the two to function as a stopper to KORs with negligible activation of MORs.  
Essentially this means that by activating the KOR, opioid peptides which are endogenous ligands of the KOR and function by inversing morphine-like, euphoric endorphins, create a sense of dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects, and are to produce changes in neuroplasticity evoked by chronic stress that has led to the development of depression and CNS disorders and drug addiction.  It is suggested in research that inhibiting the KOR abolishes antidepressant-like effects of buprenorphine, but the drug exhibits both antagonistic and agonist properties.  This has led to the concern that in theory, ALKS-5461 could be limited in the effectiveness of treatment of depression.  

Granted a Fast Track Designation in 2013, the drug has proceeded up to Phase III where thee different trials were initiated for the treatment of depression.  The first two trials failed in 2016, FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, however based on the third trial, FORWARD-5, the company submitted an NDA in 2017 for ALKS-5461.  Things started to look grim for the company moving forward, as the FDA served Alkermes a refuse-to-file letter saying that more data from well-controlled clinical trials must be presented before an application would be recognized.  However, just two weeks after serving the notice, the FDA rescinded their letter and accepted the NDA after productive interactions with Alkermes where the company clarified certain aspects of the NDA.  No further data was needed to rescind the letter and PDUFA date is scheduled by January 31, 2019.

The first two trials failed after the company reported higher placebo responses as the chief obstacle in their studies.  Not something a company would like to hear in relation to an antidepressant medication.  Causing the stock to plummet 44% in 2016, from nearly $80 to under $40, the company has been slowly recovering since.  ALKS-5461’s fate lies in the hands of FORWARD-5, without a clear success and perfect data, an FDA approval seems unlikely for this drug. 

FORWARD-5 focused on two doses of 1mg/1mg and 2mg/2mg of ALKS-5461 for adjunct treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).  Concurrently to taking ALKS-5461, the patients also remained on background antidepressant therapy.  With 407 patients enrolled, 63 received 1mg/1mg, 63 received 2mg/2mg, and 280 received the placebo.  The study was conducted in two stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10, an assessment tool for depression.

In the study, ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item MADRS scores (p=0.018). ALKS-5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS-5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  2mg/2mg treatment did show a significant change, warranting its efficacy while also having no incidences of withdrawal or pattern of adverse effects suggesting abuse potential.  The clinical benefit of the compound maintained through 11-week study and the compound is relatively safe and tolerable.  Where FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 failed to meet their endpoints, FORWARD-5 succeed in meeting primary endpoint for the 2mg/2mg dose, showing great efficacy when compared to a placebo.   
November 1st, 2018, the FDA advisory committee is meeting to discuss ALKS-5471 in relation to the compound’s efficacy, safety and risk-benefit profile of the NDA for buprenorphine and samidorphan sublingual tablets for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.  In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee roughly 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  

**ALKS-4230**

Currently in Phase I of development, Alkermes does a change of pace with this immuno-oncology drug for the treatment of solid tumors, making a shift away from their regular market in the CNS disease space.  This drug candidate is an engineered fusion protein comprised of permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) α made specifically to only activate the intermediate-affinity IL-2R.  The intermediate-affinity IL-2R is expressed mainly on effector lymphocytes, which are essential in generating an antitumor immune response.  IL-2 is a cell signaling molecule which plays a role in controlling the life cycle of specialized T-cells.  ALKS-4230 selectively binds to intermediate-affinity IL-2R to both activate and increase in number the immune cells that work to battle cancer.  Their selectivity, however, means they don’t bind to the “high-affinity IL-2 receptor,” so as not to trigger greater activity or proliferation in immune cells that could dampen an anti-tumor response Research has suggested that selective activation of the intermediate-affinity IL-2R by ALKS-4230 has the potential to provide enhanced tumor killing as well as improved tolerability. 
ALKS-4230 is currently in Phase I in patients with advanced solid tumors. Key study objectives are to determine a recommended phase 2 dose and characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and evidence of antitumor activity. A dose-escalation phase in patients with refractory solid tumors (Part A) will be followed by expansion cohorts in defined populations (Part B). ALKS 4230 is administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for five days each cycle. The dose will be escalated until reaching maximum tolerated dose or an Optimal Biologic Dose. The first two dose cohorts will use a 3+3 design. Subsequent cohorts in Part A will enroll a minimum of 6 subjects. In Part B up to 21 patients will be enrolled into each of four tumor-specific cohorts. Peripheral blood samples will be collected for PK, immunogenicity and PD assessments. The primary PD endpoint is change-from-baseline in CD8+ T, NK and T reg cell counts. Other PD measures include serum concentrations of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and immunohistochemical assessment of markers of immune activation in tumor tissue from selected patients. 

Animal trials conducted previously were positive and showed the anti-tumor activity of ALKS-4230, both alone and with the checkpoint inhibitors. Rodents treated with ALKS-4230 were seen to have lesser tumor growth and better survival, supporting clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 as a potential immunotherapy in the oncology space. ALKS-4230 will be administered in combination with PD-1 inhibitor KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab). Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, complimenting the mechanisms of action from ALKS-4230.  Alkermes has accelerated clinical evaluation of ALKS 4230 in combination with pembrolizumab based on data from the ongoing monotherapy dose-escalation stage of the phase 1 study, where ALKS 4230 demonstrated dose-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on circulating natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells, and minimal and non-dose dependent effects on immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.  

Initial data from Phase I is due in the second half of 2018, estimated to come out early November.


**Competition and Market:**

ALKS-4230 is a tough market, cancer is a hot sector but it continually sees failure.  While the FDA holds the stance that they want to try to push new oncology and immuno-oncology drugs through the approval process and get them to market to potentially save or extend lives, their decisions tend to skew otherwise.  Being so early on in development, it’s not necessary to dive into the market in depth as there is a large, unmet need in the oncology sector with the main focus being in immuno-oncology.

MDD has a multifaceted and varied etiology, and remains poorly understood. The MDD market is overly crowded and overly competitive, surpassing 30 FDA approved products available for the treatment of patients, the majority of which are now available as inexpensive generics. The MDD market is currently in an active transition where patents are expiring on top-selling products such as Eli Lilly's Cymbalta and Otsuka/BMS' Abilify, paving way for launches of Lundbeck/Takeda's Trintellix and Otsuka/Lundbeck's Rexulti.  These will create a significant growth in the market as cheaper generics will become available.  Growth in the MDD market is also expected to be driven by the potential introduction of numerous promising late-stage pipeline products into the market during the next few years which are directed at treatment-resistant patients.  These products include Alkermes' ALKS-5461, Allergan/Gedeon Richter/Mitsubishi Tanabe's Vraylar, Axsome Therapeutics' AXS-05, Janssen's esketamine, and Allergan's rapastinel.

MDD is the most common mental disorder in the U.S., affecting approximately 16 million American adults, of which about one-third remain untreated. The number of treated patients is projected to rise on account of expiring patents, the increase in available generic products, and rising awareness regarding depression and mental health issues.  This competitive market was priced at a massive $3.2 billion in 2015 and is expected to consistently grow at a CAGR of 6.1% until 2025 to reach $5.8 billion.  With the current social standings of mental health, students being required to take mandatory mental health courses now in many places, and social workers and therapists being more commonplace in schools and work places, we should see a larger surge in my opinion.  Growing female prevalence, increase in prescription spending, and escalating awareness of mental health will propel the growth of this market for many years to come.


**Financials:**

Alkermes has a great financial standing in the biotech industry.  Leveraging both their approved products and impressive collaborations, the company was able to boast a revenue growth of 39% ($304.6 million) through product sales and payments.  Many opportunities lined up for the company and set them up for success this second quarter. 

*Vivitrol sales increased 15% to $76.2 million

*Aristada sales increased 48% to $33.6 million

*Royalties from Johnson &amp; Johnson partnership increased 4% to $85.2 million

*Royalties from Acorda Therapeutics decreased 22% to $19.7 million

*License revenue from Biogen generated $48.3 million in revenue


Despite increased operation costs related to commercializing their products and further research and development, the company posted a Non-GAAP net income of $45.6 million and a Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. With a total cash balance of $561 million and total debt of $280 million, the company stands on strong ground.  This second half of 2018 has several catalysts, combined with increasing revenues from collaborations and drug approvals, Alkermes is likely to see success, only to be complimented by hopefully positive data from their upcoming Phase I and PDUFA dates. The company is expecting to hit $1 billion in revenues for 2018 as a year, which would be a massive milestone for the pharmaceutical company.


**Review:**

Historically, the FDA has been flexible with depression medications, but failures will weigh Alkermes down.  Depression studies have had a flurry of failures over recent history, and failure here can dissuade further research in the pharmaceutical space until more is known on the biology side.  With over 30 currently approved products on the market for MDD, it is overly saturated and failure can spell the end for the drug.  Following their failures in FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, investors are weary of another failure, especially after the initial NDA was rejected.  Good news is, there is an advisory committee meeting in November to discuss ALKS-5461. In recent history, the FDA has gone against the decision and vote of the advisory committee only about 10% of the time over all, with 30% of the votes being against approving the drug and 70% of the votes being for approval.  Chances are from that perspective that the FDA will grant approval.  The compound also shows no suggestion of tolerance of therapeutic effects, the side effect profile was generally comparable to standard medications with no significant late appearing side effects, and when medication was halted there was no sign of opioid withdrawal.  With the competitive, growing market and patents expiring, a new and novel MDD treatment would be a value add.

In the case of the early stage ALKS-4230, oncology drug candidates historically have a 57% possibility of success moving from Phase I to Phase II compared to an industry average of 63.2% possibility of success.  This does shine in comparison to the oncology end success rate of a low 3.4%.  If I were to put my money where my mouth is, I am going with the data and not the suggestive words of the FDA to say that oncology might sound like a great industry with the backing of the FDA, but their actions prove otherwise.  Oncology drugs are more likely to be denied by the FDA and fail their clinical trials at much higher rates than other industries such as vaccines which show an end rate of success over 30%.  I would guess this drug might make it to Phase III with time, but statistically it is unlikely to see approval.  While Phase III or even Phase II are years away from completion, the data in Phase I will likely reveal a lot about the drug to make future estimations off of.  I see Phase I being positive.

Currently the stock is trading around $43 and showing a high level of support and consolidation in this zone.  With a high of over $70 not 7 months ago, the company is likely to recover and soar.  This stock does not take bad news well however, seeing several 10% or more drops over the past year, but never going under $40 for long.  I think between $42-46 are great entries for this stock.  Long term their finances are growing, increasing revenues from royalties and sales of their own approved products, on track to hit $1 billion in revenues this year, and a solid pipeline that shows great promise.  I would bank on good data from ALKS-4230 as well as a positive hearing from the advisory committee.  With the PDUFA date in January, we will see a heavy run up into the end of the year.  I would take advantage of this price entry for either a long-term hold or a swing trade.  I would predict levels of up to $55 in the coming 3 months.  


#**TLDR**

Shit will pop off in the next 3 months, I expect about 30-40% move by January 2019.  I am buying.

64,2018-11-20,closingbell,1,"The sell-off can't end until these 10 problems are fixed, Jim Cramer argues","10 problems that must be fixed before the sell-off can end: Cramer	10 problems that must be fixed before the sell-off can end: Cramer  
13 Hours Ago | 01:29
Ten things need to change for the stock market to come back from its Monday declines, CNBC's Jim Cramer said as high-profile technology stocks Facebook and Apple led the major averages lower.

""When does this rout end? When do the buyers come in? When do the sellers finish?"" he wondered aloud on ""Mad Money."" ""Frankly, we don't know, and that uncertainty is what allows this roving bear market to keep tearing us to pieces.""

Here are the various reasons that stocks are falling and what it would take for them to turn, according to Cramer:

1. Apple
Stories of Apple's alleged sales slowdowns, like Monday's report from the Wall Street Journal, are getting ""repetitive"" even as many investors treat them as new and crippling revelations, Cramer said.

""This market can't stabilize until Apple stabilizes,"" said ""Mad Money"" host, whose charitable trust owns Apple shares. He added that chart specialists have been saying that ""it's all over but the crying"" for the iPhone maker's stock.

""My view? Apple is a long-term hold, with its huge installed base giving the company's service revenue stream a lot of room to grow, which is why you own it [and] don't trade it,"" he said. ""However, I can't blame any big accounts for dumping it and, at least short term, I wouldn't expect the stock to bottom until some of the analysts start downgrading it.""

2. Facebook
Following up on his earlier comments that Facebook's stock would pop if Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg left the company, Cramer said that management has turned the social media giant's situation into ""an unmitigated disaster.""

""Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO, is now making Elon Musk look like the Dalai Lama,"" Cramer quipped. ""I've been calling for some sort of elder statesman to come in, ... like when Eric Schmidt took the reins at Google in 2001, giving the founders some adult supervision and putting the company on better footing. That's what Facebook desperately needs right now.""

Even though Cramer, whose charitable trust owns shares of Facebook, wanted to recommend the stock at its current levels, he just couldn't ""find a reason to jump in front of a speeding freight train.""

3. Software
Cramer sensed that the declines across the software sector were based on ""nothing, other than perhaps a sense that the global economy's slowing and slowing rapidly."" The weakness reminded him of late 2016, when shares of Salesforce.com slid from $81 to $54 on ""pretty much nothing.""

These days, exchange-traded funds that group related stocks together can pressure shares of high-quality companies when lower-quality competitors' shares start falling, he explained.

""The incredible thing is there's no concrete evidence whatsoever that anything is really wrong. Nobody's seen a real slowdown in the web,"" he said. ""How does it end? These brutal declines in tech typically end when the longs are finished selling and the valuations can be sustained. We're not there yet.""

4. Dip buying
""For the first time since the financial crisis, dip buying has failed,"" the ""Mad Money"" host warned, referring to his tried and true strategy of buying great stocks during their downturns.

He pointed to a number of tech stocks that have continued to slide through what looked like buyable dips, including Nvidia, Micron, Western Digital and NXP Semiconductor.

""The Nasdaq is littered with these breakdowns,"" he said. ""The presumption is that 2019 will be a down year. How can you rebut it? I have no real comeback to the theory that dip buying is dead because we've had no clarity on 2019.""

5. China
After Vice President Mike Pence's speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Saturday, Cramer worried that Washington's increasingly stark hard line against China could weigh on the market indefinitely.

""If this administration views trade with the People's Republic as simply providing fuel for their attempts to become a superpower, ... you could easily imagine them cutting off that trade entirely,"" he said. ""Of course, that would be horrendous for all sorts of American businesses — and it wouldn't work — but many people believe that's where we may be headed. I think it's extreme, but try telling the sellers that.""

6. Fed
Stuck between weaker housing data and strong employment results, the Federal Reserve represents the sixth piece of the market's puzzle, Cramer said.

""It's a shame that we need to wait until things get that bad before the Fed will change course, ... but they don't seem to care about anything the markets are saying,"" he said. ""The Fed wants concrete evidence of people being thrown out of work before they become less hawkish. I do not think that's the way to run the Fed, but I am definitively not in charge.""

7. Confusion
The few stocks that are bucking the broader market's declines are those that investors tend to buy when they're worried about an impending recession.

""Given that nobody thinks you can slip into a recession so fast after such strong economic numbers, there's genuine confusion. Confusion makes people want to sell,"" Cramer said.

8. Techincals
Even on a technical basis, things are looking ugly for stocks, the ""Mad Money"" host warned. The market will be hard-pressed to find a bottom with key support levels falling through left and right.

9. Retail
Those who think that the economy is so strong that it can handle any number of interest rate hikes are fooling themselves, Cramer said.

""When you look at all the very good retailers that have been shelled after they reported, great companies like Macy's, Home Depot [and] Walmart, that's the market telling you to be concerned,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem to concern the Fed at all.""

10. Selling
""We aren't even that oversold yet,"" meaning that a bounce could still be long in the tooth, Cramer warned.

""There's too much hope. There's not enough hatred in my Twitter feed,"" he said. ""The good news? If we keep falling at this pace, ... it won't be long before we reach oversold levels, where all hope is extinguished and we can bounce.""

Facebook: 181.42 to 144.96, down 36.46 USD

While the year still has about 6 weeks left, the clear winners are Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, in that order. Google flatlined for the year and Facebook lost value. While I do not have a stake in any of these stocks, I'd watch out for April 2019 when the Pentagon announces who will receive the JEDI contract, a long term deal to shift the Pentagon to cloud computing, and it's between Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's Web Services. Critics say Bezos declaring the DC area as the area where Amazon is going to expand with 25,000 new jobs was his ""boss move"". The JEDI contract is huge, because not is it only a $10 billion government contract, it also gives a huge advantage to that company for future government contracts. Google is not in the bidding if you're wondering because of an internal politics with their coders not wanting to build technology for military.

While everyone focuses on Amazon, and rightly so because they definitely were the clear winner of 2018, Microsoft made huge gains and rapid growth, and personally, I feel that Microsoft has once again proven that they can continue to be the 800 lb gorilla in the tech industry. Apple also gained significantly, but the fact that they will no longer publish total number of units sold for iPhones and other Apple items, as well as tech reviewers turning on Apple for charging more year after year while providing less, means Apple's time in the sun may be limited. 

Google needs to get its internal politics together, they flatlined for the entire year and flatlining is bad. I think that they're at a severe disadvantage selling their own hardware without their own flagship stores where they can control the shopping experience and gain user data, and clearly setting up their own brick and mortar stores has worked for Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. 

Facebook is one of those companies I'd throw in the towel. Zuckerberg was able to buy the future for $1 billion to acquire Instagram and $19 billion to acquire WhatsApp, but Facebook's reputation has been dragged through the mud so hard, the next generation of cool and hip social media will most likely not sell to Zuckerberg for any price because they don't want to be associated. Facebook is a social network where Baby Boomers have it as their default, Millenials have either left it or cling on for the nostalgia back when it was cool in 2010, and Generation Z hasn't even joined it once, opting for Facebook-owned Instagram and Google-owned YouTube.

In summary, Amazon under Bezos will most likely do fine in the future, Microsoft will continue to flourish, Google is a tossup because it's totally up to them whether or not they get their internal affairs in order and take retail seriously if they're going to sell their own hardware, Apple's strategy for short term profit at the cost of alienating people will mean it'll do well in the next few years but after that people will either mitigate how much Apple products they buy, or straight up buy their tech from some other company, and Facebook is a total sell."
66,2018-11-04,rejiuspride,1,Degiro question about fees and USD currency.,"So first My country of Origin is Poland. I paid small deposit about ~1K Euro (4K PLN).  Few weeks ago there was change in Degiro  and base currency is EURO.     
So consider this scenarios:  
1. Want to buy Polish stock. So from my understanding they won't use my deposit and they will use EURO =&gt; PLN. 
Probably If I sell they will also convert PLN =&gt; EUR.   
So what is the fee?      
2. I want to buy EU stocks for example German one. 
No conversion but after sometime. I want to whitdraw money
so there is conversion EURO =&gt; PLN      
3. I want to buy US stocks.  
From document I can read that     
""0.50 EUR + 0.004 USD for action"".  So buying 100 actions 
50 EURO + 0.4 USD or 0.5 EURO + 0.4 USD.      

So now I have 2 options:    
Manual exchange or Auto FX      
1. For very big is better Manual = 10.00 EUR + 0.02%
2. For small is  Auto FX 0.10%    

If I am wrong plz correct me.  Because of 1 point investing in Polish Market is not good. I don't how exchange work. 
2 point i don't know much about Euro stock exchange also is hard to get data.    
3 point US stock. I have a lot of data, I have a lot of resources. 
Is there a clever way to not pay conversion between EURO =USD, every time I buy sell stock?      


PS. Atm I just try to learn as much i can before making any trade. I will probably made some simulation before to check How much I lose."
67,2018-12-31,Immulate,1,"Forbes 30 under 30 Millionaire Chris Kelsey Reveals ""My Biggest Scams""","This post is an excerpt from Forbes 30 under 30 Millionaire Chris Kelsey's account of his ""biggest scams"":

&amp;#x200B;

Stupid people like to say I am a scammer because of many different, stupid reasons and they’ve always been wrong. I have actually scammed before, but not from the things that people have accused me of doing.

&amp;#x200B;

1. E-Whoring

In May 2013, I googled how to make money online from scamming (not those exact words but something to that extent). E-whoring was one of the first things I saw that appealed to me due to the possibility of making a lot of money from it. I read guides that talked about going on adult chats while pretending to be a girl, and selling picture packs or cam shows to them.

&amp;#x200B;

I went on an adult chat site (I don’t remember the name, nor do I want to) and said I was selling picture packs. Some people added me on Skype, and some weird guy said he’d pay me $30. I took some random picture pack from online and sent it to him. I got up and ran around the room because it was pretty much the first time I made money completely on my own.

&amp;#x200B;

I kept trying this for the next week but had very little success. I wanted to take it to the next level so I learned more about VCWs. They were videos that you could play on your Skype screen and click different buttons to prove you’re real. The VCW that I downloaded for free from a random hacker forum would show a woman sitting on the chair, and I could click “wave,” “blow kiss,” and other stupid things. They were live recordings of a woman who was paid to record her different actions for the sake of making a VCW. VCW stands for “virtual cam whore” which I actually did not know until today.

&amp;#x200B;

I began offering cam shows while pretending to be a girl on the chat. Once they’d add me on Skype, if they seemed serious, we’d start a skype call and I had the VCW playing so it showed a girl on the screen. I kept a piece of paper so I could block the top part of my screen so I couldn’t see whatever weird shit the potential buyer in the skype call was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually they’d ask me to do different emotes and sometimes they’d ask for an emote that I didn’t have in the VCW, so I’d try to click a similar emote to make it possibly look real. I would say that I did it but it was laggy as the reason why they couldn’t see it properly. If I failed this test, I wouldn’t get their money, and sometimes I could tell they just wanted to stay on the call as long as possible, so then I’d hang up and block them.

&amp;#x200B;

The most I ever made selling cam shows was $250 in a night, when I was 16. I only accepted Amazon gift cards instead of Paypal because it was harder to refund. I read on the forums many horror stories of other e-whorers (lol) losing money because of Paypal refunds.

&amp;#x200B;

I would sell cam shows for whatever price I thought I could get. Once they sent the first gift card, I’d tell them it didn’t work and to send another. This worked about 50% of the time and it doubled the money. I’d place an order on Amazon as soon as possible just incase they tried to refund the gift card.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I received their money, I would either block them or troll them. If I wanted to troll them, I usually made the cam show look like it was about to begin. I would then spam click to repeat one of actions over and over and finally played this video.

&amp;#x200B;

At one point it started getting harder to make money because my VCW was free and dozens of people were using the same VCW on the same adult chat websites. I decided to mention that my VCW was an underage girl. Once they’d start talking to me, I’d say that they needed to give me $100-$200 or I’d report them to police (I never actually reported them). It usually didn’t work because they’d just block me but I did get $180 one time. I could’ve scammed for more money but I really hated blackmailing people as it pushed my moral boundaries. I likely tried the blackmail idea around 5–10 times before I stopped and I always tried my best to do it without really scaring them or harming them. If they ever seemed extremely scared I would backtrack so that they wouldn’t get too scared (as I said, I really hated doing this).

&amp;#x200B;

I only made around $3,600 in total but I was enthralled to have made this much on my own at 16. I used the money mostly to buy designer clothes or random things I wanted. My “e-whoring history” has been a running joke between my friends and I.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Amazon Replacements

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning 2014, I had already quit e-whoring and I was looking to find the next way to make money. My friend told me about how you could call Amazon and say that your package never arrived. I tried it with an iPad and it worked. I sold it on Craigslist for a few hundred bucks, and I was amazed.

&amp;#x200B;

I joined a social engineering forum online and a guy was advertising that you could buy one item and get up to 3 more for free. I eventually learned the process. You would buy the item (it had to be sold by amazon), then tell them that it came broken. Each time the replacement arrived, you’d give a different excuse (although sometimes it worked even when I gave the same reason).

&amp;#x200B;

I had different kids from my high school receiving packages at their addresses for me. I also found houses for sale and sent them there, although this was risky as sometimes the packages were lost or sent back to amazon (because the mailmen sometimes don’t deliver to “empty” properties).

&amp;#x200B;

On one amazon account, I received 8 Macbook Pros for the price of one. Besides Amazon, I would order items from other websites and say they didn’t arrive. While the most I made in one month was $8,000 profit, I also had received thousands of dollars in free designer clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

I also found a glitch (due to the help of the social engineering forum) to receive unlimited Xbox One replacements on the Microsoft website. I only ended up receiving about 8 Xbox Ones before they fixed the bug.

&amp;#x200B;

A website called [Zagg.com](https://Zagg.com) allowed you to add products to your Zagg account and click a button saying it is broken. I wanted to test how well it worked so I added 20 headphones to my account and reported them all as broken. I then sent it to a house for sale. They all arrived at once but I ended up giving them away because no one wanted to buy them.

&amp;#x200B;

In August 2014, a kid I sent items to stole my Macbooks and threatened to fight me at school. I didn’t care if he tried to fight me, but I was worried that if he fought me, the school would ask the reason. So I went to the school first saying I sent packages to his house and that he stole them, and now he’s trying to fight. They ended up not caring at all about that, and instead put me under police investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

A cop came to school interviewing me about why I sent packages to different people’s houses. I told him that I was ordering things for my friends who couldn’t receive packages at their own houses. I never heard from them after that and if I do, I don’t really care.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Fiverr Flyer Distribution Scam

&amp;#x200B;

I originally wanted to start a flyer distribution service by hiring Fiverr flyer distributors. I eventually realized that all of them were scams, despite having hundreds of 5 star reviews. I decided I’d try it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted a service on Fiverr offering to distribute 50 flyers at Stanford University for $5. As I received each order, I’d print a flyer and take a picture of it around my house. I ended up receiving $200 custom orders for 100,000 flyers. I got rated as a top seller on Fiverr and was featured on the front page.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the people gave top reviews because they didn’t assume someone would be lying about posting the flyers (especially with photo proof). I didn’t feel extremely guilty about this scam as every person needing flyers distributed would’ve likely had no more than two responses if the flyers were actually posted. I’m not saying that to justify the scam, I literally mean that the offerings of the flyers sucked so bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I forgot to hide the EXIF data of the images and one person traced it by my house. They wrote a bad review saying I wasn’t actually posting at Stanford.

&amp;#x200B;

Each time I received a negative review, I would accuse the person that posted the negative review of asking me to post extra flyers for free. Since Fiverr allows the sellers to have the last response on a bad review, it would always make me look innocent. I sometimes made $500 in a week doing almost nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Credit Card Fraud

&amp;#x200B;

I posted a credit card fraud guide in December 2017 and was heavily investigated by the FBI (before and especially after I posted it). I was never interviewed or told I was under investigation but many weird things happened including my fiance’s car getting searched. They would also call in to businesses (like Best Buy) before I’d arrive so that they could be prepared to arrest me if I bought something with a stolen card.

&amp;#x200B;

Credit card fraud feels like having unlimited money. I spent $5,000+ with a credit card that I paid $15 in Bitcoin for. I used some of the money I made for myself and gave the rest of the proceeds away. If you are in a time of need and want to make a quick buck, this is a great way.

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, I never did it to small businesses as that is screwing over regular people rather than banks. When you use a stolen card to buy something or send money, it is safe to assume that the business will lose their money once the original card owner reports the fraudulent charge (although some are protected by insurance). If you do this at Walmart, that’s fine. If do it to a mom and pop restaurant, just remember you are likely screwing them over and they will lose money (this is why I focused on big businesses only). As a side note, be careful with stores such as Target and Walmart as they specifically look out for credit card fraud. Eventually you will be flagged and can be at risk for getting caught.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I got out of my bad financial situation at that time, I stopped doing it. I don’t see it as a longterm way of making money. It is a great feeling when it works out as it feels like a casino but with a much more likelihood of making a profit.

&amp;#x200B;

Credit card fraud showed me the massive flaws of our current banking system. Its popularity has drastically increased as people are realizing how profitable it can be. I know in the near future people will not need to commit credit card fraud because our economy will have been fixed. Until then, keep swiping."

&gt; Retailers wrapped up one of the strongest holiday seasons in years with Americans crowding stores for last-minute Christmas gifts and delivery companies so far able to keep up with the surge in online orders.

&gt; Stores have met the lofty sales expectations set by analysts and industry groups, according to early data, showing that many chains continue to reap the benefits of a strong U.S. economy and rising consumer confidence, as well as company investments to boost their online business and clean up stores.

&gt; Total U.S. retail sales, excluding automobiles, rose 5.2% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 19 compared with last year, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending with all forms of payment.

&gt; Although foot traffic to traditional stores fell during the Black Friday weekend, overall retail sales rose thanks in large part to a surge in online shopping, which jumped 26% from a year earlier, according to Adobe.

&gt; “This year, we clearly saw a dramatic shift in holiday in both cadence and consumer response,” as retailers offered big deals over Thanksgiving, then sales fell, said Marshal Cohen, chief retail industry adviser at the NPD Group.

&gt; But spending has picked up and so far declines in the stock market and a partial shutdown of the U.S. government largely haven’t caused shoppers to pull back, said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research and consulting firm. Lower gas prices in recent weeks may help spur spending this week, he said.

&gt; “In terms of accounting, it all counts for the fourth quarter,” the period when retailers make up a significant percentage of sales, said Mr. Johnson.

SCOTT WAPNER: Welcome to Los Angeles Jeffrey. Thank you for having us back.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Welcome to DoubleLine.

SCOTT WAPNER: Almost a year to the day we were last with you.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: I think it was December 13th last year.

SCOTT WAPNER: That’s right. We’re still volatile in the market. Today is another representation of that. We’re still about 50 points above on the S&amp;P of the February lows.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Yes.

SCOTT WAPNER: Do you think we’re going to go below that?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Well in the fullness of time, I think absolutely we’ll go below that. I’m pretty sure this is a bear market. People like this definition of 20% down as a bear market, but that’s obviously very arbitrary. I’ve been around over 35 years in the business and have seen a number of bear markets. It’s more about how you lead into it, how it develops and how the sentiment changes, and I think we’ve had pretty much all of the variables that characterize a bear market I remember going -- usually something happens that really doesn’t make any sense at all and I’m kind of amazed how it goes on longer than it should like back in the dotcom days when companies were being IPO’d and had no sales let alone revenues that’s hard to be and they would actually explode to the upside on the IPO. That’s kind of crazy and then we had the subprime lending with pick a pay loans back in ’05 and ’06 and that was kind of crazy and that went on longer than it should have. This time like we talked about a year ago it was crypto, bitcoin which was truly a mania, we talked a year ago it just went up. Maybe in the end it’s a good thing or the block chain technology is a good thing. The way it was being treated and believed in was a mania and then it crashed about a week after we met a year ago and it was at 17,500 when we were speaking right in this spot and of course now it’s down below 3,500 so an 85% decline. And one after another you start to see various sectors of the global financial markets give it up. The global stock market peaked January 26th. And so did the New York Stock Exchange composite, January 26 but the Dow Jones Industrials, the Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500. All of these things, one by one, started to roll over and come the summertime or later in the summertime you were down to the FAANGs and then you were down to two stocks it was amazon and apple and then amazon gave it up. And then finally when they decided they weren’t going to tell you how many phones they sold anymore apple gave it up.

SCOTT WAPNER: That was the last straw.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: That was kind of the last straw. It was October 3rd when the tariffs -- well, it was that USMC -- whatever it’s called, it’s really NAFTA but it was announced we would have this change in NAFTA that would lead to a requirement that a certain fraction of car parts be made in higher costs locales which basically meant not Mexico. A senior executive at ford motor said, well obviously we’re going to have to raise the prices on our cars if input prices are going up. Suddenly the market seemed to wake up to the fact that this was real and the next day the stock market tipped over in fact, on October 3rd, Jay Powell said we’re a long way from neutral. And that was a big problem, too.

SCOTT WAPNER: That seemed to be the tipping point.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Yes that with the USMCA thing and the Ford Motor executive, those things seemed to come together and coalesce into we’ve had enough. And, yeah, the Jay Powell thing was interpreted by the market as a scary thing, the fed was going to keep going a long distance further and then the market dropped over 10% and suddenly the Fed had to massage the rhetoric. And suddenly it was, well, we have a new definition of neutral maybe. We’re actually within the lower bound or close to the lower bound of neutral in an attempt to stabilize the market. So, yeah, it seems like a bear market to me in the way things trade with late day volume being bad and the like the best thing for the near term, I think, is that the most export sensitive stock market, South Korea, the Kospi bottomed October 29 so at least that’s not pushing to new lows and emerging markets broadly are doing better because they’re extremely export driven. Maybe this leg down is getting toward an exhaustion point the sentiment is pretty dark right now. I’d be happier on the short term outlook if the VIX would go above 40 which is usually a sign.

SCOTT WAPNER: That would be quite a spike.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Well, that’s typically what happens when you get to the bottom, there’s so much nervousness and fear but the Vix is a little bit disturbing how it doesn’t go higher. Actually as the market pushes to the down side. But i think this is a bear market and i think we’ll go below the February lows almost with certainty.

SCOTT WAPNER: Is it a long lasting bear market or it can be short term as some have suggested on our air and then this secular bull market will resume?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: I don’t think so. I think it’s a bear market. I think we’ve had the first leg down and the second leg down is usually more painful than the first leg down if this is indeed a bear market. Maybe in the short term we’re getting flushed out. I think it’s lasted a long time. It has a lot to do with the fact i believe we’re in a situation that maybe unprecedented was too strong but it is highly unusual that we are increasing the budget deficit so spectacularly so late in the cycle while the fed is hiking interest rates. I know you’ve teased the segment by talking about the suicide mission I’ve been talking about for months. The fed almost seems to be on a suicide mission. What i mean by that the deficit in the United States is extraordinarily high from where we are in the economic cycle and given what the debt level accumulated is already. In the first two months of fiscal ’19 it was just announced last week there’s a funny thing that happened in November where the payments for December ended up being pushed to November because December 1st was on a Saturday if you take that out it’s $44 billion that’s a big number. So if you wake that out and say that’s December and not November. Still, the first two months of fiscal ’19, the budget deficit is going up at an annualized rate of $1.62 trillion. And that’s the official budget deficit. The actual budget deficit is larger than what the report -- for example, for fiscal ’18, which ends September 30th, the deficit was around $800 billion. But the national debt went up by $1.3 trillion almost now. Why? What’s the difference there? There are items that are off budget. So the budget deficit really for fiscal ’18 was $1.3 nearly trillion that’s 6% of GDP and we’re supposedly having a good economy and we’re supposedly having jobs growth and all this other great stuff. In actuality we increase the deficit by 6% of GDP since government deficit change is a significant fraction – a significant variable in the GDP equation it seems to me there’s no real economic growth that’s happening away from the deficit. So what worries me is that as we move into a weaker economy, which will happen at some points and certainly the economy looks weaker now than it did entering 2018, that the deficit will continue to expand at a rate which could be prohibitive for the usual decline in interest rates helping to stimulate the economy. That’s what I think is the real big variable investors need to focus on. And while this is happening with the deficit exploding, the fed is raising interest rates which means the interest expense is going to be increasing year by year as these zero interest rates that we had for a number of years start to roll off and the bonds have to be refloated once they mature, the next five years we have something like $7 trillion of treasuries that are maturing the average coupon on those treasuries is almost as low as 2%, slightly higher, 2.1%. When they roll over, they’re going to be at a higher interest rate because the fed has been on the suicide mission of raising interest rates so the interest expense on that $7 trillion of treasuries is going to be -- maybe the rate will be at 3% like it is now or maybe 4% and you might even see we have an expense that goes up $100, $140 billion. So kind of the … of our government is coming back to haunt us ultimately. In financial markets, these things go on so much longer than they should Ross Perot ran for president running infomercials about we were doomed on the deficit and there was a book written in 1992, that same year, that was somewhat sponsored by the Peterson Foundation called bankruptcy 1994. And the idea behind the book was we have this compounding curve and this debt problem that is going to come back and really cause us problems. Well, he was early. He was early by at least 26 years. But he’s right, you can’t keep going on with the debt finance scheme, and I’m worried when the next recession comes we could be looking at, well heck, we’re supposedly in a good economy and the next two months we’re running $1.6 trillion what if we go into a recession what’s the deficit going to be $3 trillion? And does that mean interest rates don’t go down during the next recession, which is an idea I’ve been noodling around for a long time maybe they go higher with I’ve had a call the next two years that come 2021 the ten-year treasury will be at 6%. I get a lot of pushback a lot of debt deflation is out there in the twitter-sphere absolutely wrong the economy can’t handle higher interest rates. Interest rates might have a life of their own. It might not matter what the market can handle or can’t handle.

SCOTT WAPNER: they haven’t to this point. It’s been somewhat surprising that rates have remained where they are you said 3%. They hit 3%. 3.25%. Here we are below 2.9% today.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: yes, on the ten year. I was focusing on the three year when it broke above 3.25% that was incredibly important frankly, I didn’t think we’d go back below 3.25 once we broke above because it seemed like such an important level. Here we are back below 3.25. But not impressively not in a way that would be consistent with a big decline in the global stock market. There’s a thing called the death cross. It’s a 50-day moving average goes below 200 a day particularly when they’re both declining. Presently about 80% of the countries in the MSCI World Index are in a death cross 80%. It’s amazing. And there was a chart that got a lot of play put out by deutsche bank about how many risk assets globally are in officially bear market down the arbitrary 20% number that, again, i don’t really ascribe to but so commonly used at that they used it and the highest in the data series going back to 1901. It’s like 90% of the risk assets around the world in dollar terms are in bear markets. So it’s a pretty widespread and coordinated set of weaknesses.

SCOTT WAPNER: Are you saying that by embarking on this suicide mission that the fed shouldn’t raise interest rates this week?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: I don’t really think that’s the main thrust of my idea this week, yeah, they shouldn’t raise them this week.

SCOTT WAPNER: They shouldn’t?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: No I don’t think they should. The bond market is saying, fed, you’ve got no way you should be raising interest rates look at the 2s, 3s, five-year part of the yield curve which are flat at 270 I guess that corroborative of a hike. But it is basically saying in the year 2019 you’re going to have a cut, this big, but a cut that was priced into the yield curve and in 2020 another cut. The problem, though, isn’t that the fed shouldn’t be raising rates. The problem is the fed shouldn’t have kept them so low for so long.

SCOTT WAPNER: Sure.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: The problem we shouldn’t have had negative interest rates like we still have in Europe. We shouldn’t have done quantitative easing which is a circular financing scheme. The problem really is the deficit. The fed is kind of helpless here. The fact that the deficit is so out of control this late in the economic cycle, we have never before had the fed raise interest rates while the budget deficit was expanding it’s never happened. Because usually the budget deficit expands in response to a recession. It’s a way of stimulating to get us out of recession. Instead, we did it as a last gasp of keeping this economic recovery going by making it completely deficit based.

SCOTT WAPNER: So this morning, President Trump once again Tweeted about the Fed. Quote, “It’s incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris burning, China way down, that the Fed is even considering another interest rate hike. Take the victory,” he stayed. Stan Druckenmiller, today, Op-Ed “Wall Street Journal”: The Fed should quote “Pause its double-barreled blitz of higher rates and tighter liquidity.” So they’re right, you agree with them?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: I do agree with them. I’ve been saying this pretty much all year, the double-barreled was actually -- he may have borrowed that from me, that’s how I’ve been talking about – it’s how I’ve been phrasing it all year – that we’ve really been tightening interest rates in a way that’s more than people understand. There’s a duo of economists at the Atlanta Fed called Wu and Xia, who did a study a few years back ‘What was the effect of quantitative easing?’ If they hadn’t done the quantitative easing and instead had taken the European model and gone to negative interest rates, how negative would those rates have had to be to have the same stimulative effect as the quantitative easing? And they concluded – and I don’t know if they’re right or not it’s very hypothetical – but their conclusion was that the quantitative easing amounted to 300 basis points of further cuts. So if they hadn’t done quantitative easing, to have the same stimulative effect, the Fed funds would have had been negative 300 basis points. Well let’s just say they’re right. Since they did about 2.5 trillion of quantitative easing and it was 300 basis points, 2.5 trillion divided by 3 is roughly $800 billion. Okay? So $800 billion is -- $800 billion divided by 4 means that’s what quantitative easing is one cut. So 100 basis points is $800 billion. So divided by 4. 25 basis points is $200 billion of quantitative easing. Well so far we’re pushing towards $400 billion -- we’re not there yet but we’re soon to be there -- of quantitative tightening. That means we’ve had would more rate hikes from quantitative tightening if Wu and Xia are right. So the Fed hasn’t just raised rates in that context eight times. They’ve raised them ten times. And the quantitative tightening is stated to be as high as $600 billion over fiscal ’19. So that’s another three rate hikes. So if they were going to follow their dots and raise rates so many times, there’s another three on top of that. So the amount of tightening has been underappreciated, I think, and Stan is right as he often is – he’s one of the greatest investors ever for, him and Chanos, the two titans of the hedge fund industry. They’re right that we are seeing the bond market react in a way that is historically very predictive of the Fed should not be doing this. And yet, we have this strange dynamic that they’ve almost promised a rate hike here in December. And then the President shows up with his Tweets trying to bully them into not doing it and it puts Jay Powell and the team in a very tough position. Because they’re damned if they do and damned if they don’t."
72,2018-12-18,FunctionOfLife,1,Old Fortune article on Jeffrey Gundlach. It’s a fun read.,"Firing the $70 billion man: Full version



By Mina Kimes, writerMarch 10, 2010: 10:10 AM ET
NEW YORK (Fortune) -- On November 19, 2009 Jeffrey Gundlach was named a finalist for Morningstar's award for bond fund manager of the decade. For Gundlach, the nomination recognized 10 years of stellar results, exceeding even the returns of the legendary king of bonds, Bill Gross.

Two weeks later Gundlach was confronted, fired, and then pursued on foot out of a Los Angeles skyscraper by two lawyers working for TCW, the money management firm with $110 billion in assets where Gundlach had worked for 24 years.

Not only did TCW oust Gundlach, but the firm also announced that it was acquiring an entire company -- crosstown rival Metropolitan West Asset Management -- to replace him. That in turn set off a wave of defections from TCW, as 45 of the 60 staffers who had worked for Gundlach streamed out the door to join him at a new firm that he had opened within days of leaving.

Then things really turned nasty. TCW filed an incendiary lawsuit in January accusing Gundlach of conspiring with confederates at TCW to steal proprietary information as part of a long-running plot to form their own competing firm. The suit added a salacious twist of the knife, perfectly calibrated for maximum media interest -- Gundlach had allegedly stashed a trove of illicit material in his office: 70 pornographic magazines and videos, 12 ""sexual devices,"" and several bags of marijuana.

Gundlach has countered with his own lawsuit. He charges TCW and its owner, the French bank Société Générale, with pushing him out so that they can get their hands on his lucrative fees. In addition to his mutual funds, Gundlach had managed what were effectively two hedge funds for TCW, each of which commanded the amped-up fees typical of those vehicles. Gundlach calculates that he would have personally reaped $600 million to $1.2 billion over the next few years.

What in the name of Peter Lynch is going on here? Sure, we've come to expect shenanigans from Wall Street. But even if the mutual fund world hasn't been exactly pristine (remember the market-timing scandals a few years ago?), more often than not its managers and executives have been well-behaved schoolboys compared with the leather-clad (in spirit, anyway) rock stars among the investment bankers and hedge funders.

But unlike most mutual fund companies, TCW has always aspired to a Wall Street culture. In particular, it cultivated a star system. The company grew by importing ambitious money managers and granting them autonomy. They could invest as they liked; TCW would handle sales and marketing. The two sides would then split the fees, with each manager cutting an individual deal. The result could be huge rewards for managers -- Gundlach made $134 million over the past five years -- but some came to view themselves essentially as sole proprietors.

TCW seemed content with the arrangement and did little to tie its managers' fates to the company as a whole. Few of them, for example, received significant stakes in TCW. That bred frustration in multiple generations of standout performers, who viewed corporate executives (some of whom did receive ownership shares) as getting rich off their toil.

So it went for Gundlach, a bona fide investing star who, by the end, oversaw about 70% of TCW's assets, some $70 billion, putting him in charge of one of the biggest pots of money in the country. Gundlach didn't just generate steady returns; he avoided the blowup of the century. A specialist in mortgage-backed securities, he publicly warned in 2007 that ""the subprime mortgage market is a total, unmitigated disaster, and it's going to get worse."" He invested accordingly, not only delivering positive returns in the blighted year of 2008 but also earning himself a growing role as a media sage. His ego grew along with it.

There are few people like Jeffrey Gundlach in the mutual fund world -- or in any world. A former rock-and-roll drummer, Gundlach, 50, is a math whiz (but not a quant). He views everything in binary terms: Either you perform to his standards or you don't, and he won't hesitate to let you know which category you fall into. Nor is he shy in articulating his view of himself. ""I was by far the biggest revenue generator at TCW, by far the biggest performer,"" he says. ""I created $4 billion in value for clients in '09. If telling you that is self-promotion, so be it. It's just a fact.""

With Gundlach, it's hard to tell which is largest: his brain, his self-regard -- or his resentment of TCW. He claims that his recent firing was actually the third time the company tried to get rid of him. ""All three of them were an attempt to just steal the economics,"" Gundlach contends. ""And this time they did it. Except they didn't steal the economics. They blew it up. They blew it up. They tried to steal the economics, but they didn't understand. They never understood.""

TCW customers, meanwhile, have been watching the blood feud in disbelief. Investors have fled, with assets shrinking $25 billion since Gundlach was fired. For those who have remained, it seems that their patience is limited. ""I'm aware of the investment prowess of both [Gundlach and the new TCW team],"" says Mansco Perry III, CIO of the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, which has $50 million invested in TCW. ""But right now I don't believe they're acting in the best interest of their clients.""

frey Gundlach is the sort of boss who inspires sharply divided opinion. He fostered loyalty among the members of his60-person team at TCW, handing out generous bonuses to his group. He also openly mocked the company's other divisions, especially its stock team.

Many outside Gundlach's orbit viewed him as an ill-tempered bully. He subjected subordinates to withering cross examinations and relished pointing out errors. Some in TCW's New York offices celebrated his dethroning by posting printouts of his scathing e-mails in the halls.

By contrast, loyalists valued his directness. Some would preserve his occasional written compliments as treasured mementos. ""You don't have to guess where you stand with him,"" says Bonnie Baha, a portfolio manager who followed Gundlach to his new firm, called DoubleLine.

An interview with Jeffrey Gundlach is less like conversation than like listening to a manic stream-of-consciousness monologue. Consider Gundlach's description of his aborted stint in a math Ph.D. program at Yale (after getting an undergraduate degree in the same subject at Dartmouth): ""It was a four-year Ph.D. deal. And they gave me a full scholarship, and it was very hard to get into. There were only seven people accepted, and they had hundreds of applicants. And one of the guys, he was Korean, he had come in via Toronto. I was the only American left. The other American had flunked out. There was a Chinese guy who had polio. That guy was smart. That guy was something else. He had crutches. He had horrible dandruff. He never took a shower, but he was one smart motherf----r, let me tell you. That guy is probably the smartest guy I ever met in my life. And he was my friend. I was the only guy he would be friends with, and there was this other guy, this Korean guy out of Korea, out of Toronto, and I didn't like him very much, and I was walking down the street, and there he was. It was like, 'Hey, Jeff!' They called me Jeff in the day. 'Hey!' You know, good to see you. I was Ike -- I had this really heebie-jeebie feeling, and he goes, 'Let's go to the bookstore and get our books.' And I was like, 'Uh, I don't know.' And he was like, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'Uh, I don't know.' And it hit me right then. I said, 'I'm not going back. I'm not doing it. I can't do it. This is pointless.' ""

Gundlach's mind combines that feverish quality with a near-total recall of endless minutiae. But somehow, when it comes to investing, he's able to process huge quantities of details and extract a big-picture message. The result has been superb performance: His flagship $12 billion TCW Total Return Bond Fund returned nearly 8% annually over the past decade. Those results beat 99% of competitors, and his nonpublic funds have done even better.

For all Gundlach's prowess with numbers, it was anything but obvious that he'd go into finance. He grew up outside Buffalo in a family of modest means. Their only savings, he says, consisted of some Xerox stock, courtesy of their uncle, Robert Gundlach, the inventor of the modern photocopier. ""We owned Xerox, and it went way, way up, and for the first time it actually felt like we had a little money. And then it crashed,"" Gundlach says. He was 12 or 13 at the time. ""It was my first experience with a bear market, and I remember it really well. The rallies are pennies, and the selloffs are dollars, and that's always the way bear markets behave.""

In his mid-twenties Gundlach played drums in a variety of rock bands that performed in L.A. clubs but never made the big time. Meanwhile he was holding down a dreary day job in the actuarial department at Transamerica. One night in 1985 he was watching an episode of ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,"" that described the most lucrative careers. Gundlach decided he would, as he told one interviewer, ""figure out my life.""

The program identified investment banking as the richest occupation. Gundlach didn't know what investment bankers did, but he contacted 23 firms. Impressed by his math credentials, TCW invited him in and offered him a $30,000-a-year job as a research assistant in the firm's bond department. (This despite the fact that, according to Gundlach, he didn't even know what a bond was at the time.)

Gundlach was thrilled. He loved wearing a suit and tie to TCW's elegant offices. He became fascinated by bonds. ""I felt like I was in the middle of something that was important and exciting,"" he says. ""I loved it! When I would walk into a meeting and be able to say, 'I'm from TCW and here's my business card,' I was proud.""

As a young analyst, Gundlach zeroed in on the mortgage market. By age 27, he says, he had developed a reputation in his niche as a ""young hotshot."" After four years at TCW, he was promoted to co-chair of a new division -- mortgage Bonds -- and then made a managing director in 1991. ""That doesn't happen,"" he says. ""You don't go from a trainee to managing director in seven years. I was running the most important department at the firm, but the firm didn't like the fact that I was growing so much."" Gundlach is getting ahead of the story, but it appears he would later be right.

When Gundlach arrived -- and still to a large extent today -- TCW seemed like a museum version of a Wall Street firm. Even in ultra-casual Southern California, for example, the firm had a suit-and-tie dress code. Gracious meals were served in its white-linen dining room.

TCW was founded in 1971 as Trust Co. of the West by Robert Day, who inherited millions as the heir to the Superior Oil fortune and hobnobbed with the Martha's Vineyard elite. Day was a hard-nosed boss who used to smack errant employees on the head with his cigar, Gundlach says. (Day says he doesn't remember doing so.) In those days 80% of TCW's assets were in stocks, the rest in bonds. By the end of Gundlach's tenure, the ratio would almost flip.

Day built the firm by luring in Wall Street talent. One prominent star, who joined in 1985, was Howard Marks, a junk bond manager who came over from Citicorp. Marks thrived, accumulating $7 billion in assets, about 15% of TCW's total at the time. But he grew increasingly dissatisfied with having to fork over half his fees to TCW. And he resented the fact that TCW would give him no more than a nominal stake in the company. In 1995 he announced that he was leaving and taking his team with him.

Marks' departure was a less lurid, but still bitter, harbinger of what would occur with Gundlach almost 15 years later. Day sent a furious letter to clients blasting Marks' exit as ""disloyal at the very least,"" according to press accounts at the time. TCW then quickly replaced Marks' team by purchasing Crescent Capital, a small high yield bond firm in West Los Angeles.

The equity issue took on new importance when TCW decided to sell itself. In 2001, Société Générale bought 51% of TCW for $880 million. The deal, former employees say, meant lucrative paydays for a cadre of executives, including the founders of Crescent, who had received large chunks of the company. Some longtime TCW employees were embittered by the newcomers' windfall.

Management tried to mend the problems that led to Marks' departure, but the lack of equity for many managers remained a sore point. SocGen announced it would escalate its ownership to 70% and leave 30% for TCW employees. But that 30% turned out to consist of SocGen stock options rather than TCW shares. By 2007 the French bank owned 100% of the company.

Meanwhile Gundlach was accruing more and more influence and renown. In 2005 he was promoted to chief investment officer of TCW. And he was named Morningstar fund manager of the year in 2006. His decision to pull his mutual funds out of riskier debt and his accurate forecast of a looming recession brought him favorable publicity and a steady presence in the press. (Another division of TCW, also under Gundlach's umbrella but not his main focus, was a giant issuer of CDOs, many of which imploded.)

It was Gundlach's time. His reputation was growing, and bonds were beginning to enjoy their moment in the sun. The result: Investments in his funds swelled. So, too, did his ego, according to former co-workers. ""He started to think of himself as a god,"" says one who worked with Gundlach during that period.

Gundlach remained mostly satisfied until January 2009, when SocGen announced that it intended to take TCW public in five years. The uncertainty, he says, made it harder to drum up new business. And he grew even more vexed a few months later when he was passed over for the job of TCW's new CEO. Instead, the position went to the company's former president Marc Stern, who came out of retirement to assume the position.

Gundlach was infuriated by Stern's return. He was offered the job of president but turned it down. Always outspoken, Gundlach grew openly critical of TCW's management, even deriding executives while they sat a few feet away in the company dining room.

Rumors began to circulate that Gundlach would be fired. By the summer of 2009, he says, it had become difficult to work under that stress, as well as to face TCW's uncertain future. In September, Gundlach met with Stern and offered to purchase the firm at a valuation of $700 million. TCW says Stern passed the offer onto SocGen, which rejected it.

TCW and Gundlach disagree about exactly what was said at the meeting. What's clear is that Gundlach at least broached the possibility of taking his team and leaving. TCW interpreted the statement as a threat and prepared for combat: The company hired investigators to look into the affairs of Gundlach and his closest lieutenants, tapping their office phones and monitoring their e-mails. At the same time they initiated clandestine talks with MetWest, the $30 billion bond house that would eventually replace Gundlach's team.

Gundlach was preparing too. He and his ""co- conspirators"" began e-mailing one another in September about their plot to steal information, according to TCW's complaint. The suit alleges that the group referred to Gundlach as ""the Pope"" and ""the Godfather"" and swiped 9 million pages' worth of client contacts, trade tickets, and software routines used to process the complex data that go into analyzing mortgages. They retained a realtor to find an office space with 50 trading desks.

Gundlach acknowledges that his team looked at commercial real estate. It made him feel better, he says, to be making plans when he knew he was going to be fired. ""I felt powerless,"" he says. He insists, however, that he had no knowledge of the downloading, his e-mails prove otherwise. Gundlach says he hired a third party to expunge his employees' computers of TCW data and returned all their hardware to the company.

The crescendo of rumors -- of his ouster, of a sale -- was wearing on Gundlach. Still, he had no inkling of what was in store for him on Dec. 4, 2009. At 1 p.m. that day, when the markets closed on the East Coast, he was summoned to the 17th floor of TCW's headquarters. Michael Cahill, the company's general counsel, was waiting for him in a conference room with John Quinn, one of Los Angeles' top litigators.

Cahill told Gundlach that TCW was putting him on administrative leave. Gundlach argued that the move would cause a disastrous customer exodus unless they negotiated a settlement that resolved various fee and management issues. The lawyers asked him to read a draft of the complaint TCW was planning to file against him. When Quinn tried to place the papers in his hands, Gundlach got angry.

He stormed out of the room and began walking down the stairs. Quinn and Cahill trailed him, thinking he was headed for the trading floor one level down, but Gundlach kept going. It was a surreal procession, says Quinn; they marched down 17 stories in total silence. The lawyers followed Gundlach out of the building and onto the street until Gundlach finally turned around and told them he wasn't planning on stopping anytime soon.

While all this was happening, chaos had erupted on TCW's trading floor. CEO Stern sent out a companywide e-mail announcing Gundlach's termination and the acquisition of MetWest. Then Stern appeared to reiterate the news in person. Analysts watched in shock as a team of private detectives and attorneys descended. Gundlach's suspected conspirators were herded into offices and conference rooms, where the investigators interrogated them and seized laptops and records. Some company-owned BlackBerrys went dark without warning. Nervous employees scurried around the floor, trying to figure out who had been terminated. By the end of the day, the tally was five.

TCW proved inept in its efforts to stanch the turmoil caused by Gundlach's departure. On the rainy Monday morning after he was fired, TCW employees gathered in conference rooms for a companywide conference call. CEO Stern told his troops that the downpour was a sign of renewal, and that TCW would emerge as ""a firm that has respect for everyone within the firm.""

But Day, TCW's founder and chairman, was less temperate in his remarks. He told the employees that he had been through this before -- i.e., with Marks -- and that there was no other choice. ""It sort of reminds me a bit of General Washington crossing the Delaware,"" he said. ""The general was in the back of the boat. It would be like a soldier getting up, trying to rock the boat, expecting to sink the boat. His choices are very simple. You shoot the soldier. You throw him off the boat.""

After a pause, nervous laughter emanated over the speakers. Some of Gundlach's former colleagues were horrified. A few started crying. Others walked out. ""Whatever people may say about [Gundlach], here's a guy that has been working for his company for over 20 years and has made a lot of money for investors,"" says Luz Padilla, a fund manager at the company. ""After that call, I was just incensed.""

Padilla hadn't been set on leaving TCW, she says, until she realized the current imbroglio bore an uncanny resemblance to the Howard Marks controversy -- a talented manager leaves after a fight over money, and a new team takes control. ""It was a different set of players,"" she says, ""but almost the same movie."" There was also the fear that the arrival of the MetWest group would make the current bond team redundant. Dozens more followed Padilla out.

Then came the surge of customer defections. By late February TCW's assets had dropped by some $25 billion. The most prominent deserter was the U.S. Treasury, which pulled out of the $4.1 billion Public Private Investment Fund it had started with Gundlach.

Less than two weeks after he was fired, Gundlach announced that his new firm, DoubleLine, was partnering with a respected L.A. money manager: none other than Howard Marks. The onetime TCW star has thrived on his own, building a firm called Oaktree Capital with $70 billion in assets. Marks is buying 22% of DoubleLine and in exchange will provide the administrative backbone for Gundlach's new operation. Needless to say, an alliance between two of its former stars is also a not-so-subtle poke in the eye to TCW.

After weeks of relative silence, TCW struck back. On Jan. 7 the company filed its explosive complaint. It emphasized the alleged plot to steal information. It also tarred Gundlach personally, referring to the pornography, sexual devices, and marijuana retrieved from his office. TCW justified the inclusion of the prurient material in the suit under the whisper- thin pretext that it constituted a breach of company policy. Asked about the contents of his office, Gundlach offers only the mildest of quibbles: ""Not all of the items are mine."" In a letter to investors, he noted, ""I had every expectation of privacy in these spaces, which stored vestiges of closed chapters of my life.""

On a recent Thursday afternoon, Marc Stern sits in one of TCW's dining rooms with Jacques Ripoll, the head of SocGen's asset management division. The two couldn't look more different. Stern, 65, is barrel-chested with white hair and a loud, raspy laugh. Ripoll, 43, has a slick, dark coiffure and a heavy French accent. As Stern talks about growing up on a vegetable farm in New Jersey, one can't help but notice that his story resembles Gundlach's. Both were gifted kids who came from working-class families, and both share a love of art (Gundlach has an extensive collection of contemporary paintings; Stern is the chairman of the L.A. Opera, a passion he developed while riding on his father's tractor and listening to opera on the radio).

Despite the controversy, Stern insists that TCW is better positioned than ever, and its new team, he pointedly adds, is ""delighted to be here."" Stern predicts that TCW will double its assets in three years. He stresses the importance of having ""mechanisms where people share information and are willing to help each other."" While not specifically naming Gundlach, the message is clear: The star manager didn't play well with others. TCW's new head of fixed income is MetWest founder Tad Rivelle, a self-effacing, professorial type -- the anti- Gundlach -- and no slouch as a manager. His Total Return bond fund has beaten 94% of its peers over the past decade.

""TCW is ready for growth,"" Ripoll says. ""To be transparent -- this was not possible before."" And what of Gundlach's long-desired equity stake? TCW is giving shares to the new team from MetWest (as it did with the Crescent group) but is less definite about handing it to others. ""When you have a company like TCW, it is very important that you have equity held by the employees,"" Ripoll says. ""That is what we are putting in place.""

TCW's basic business model -- a collection of autonomous managers -- seems unlikely to change. In a separate interview, the founder and chairman defends the approach. ""I started the company with $2 million, and it has $115 billion today,"" says Day. ""The formula that has worked for 40 years is going to continue to work."" (Day also insists Gundlach really didn't care about an equity stake; when given the choice, he always opted for more fees.)

Gundlach, meanwhile, is still setting up shop. He has been through a lot of late. He showed up at meetings in January with a black eye and cuts on his face, which he says came from tripping and colliding with his desk at home. On Feb. 1, his wife of more than 20 years, Nancy, filed for divorce. And Bill Gross was named fixed-income fund manager of the decade; Gundlach thinks he would have taken the prize if he hadn't been fired. That said, Morningstar clearly still views him as legitimate: The organization invited Gundlach to deliver the keynote address at its annual investors conference this summer.

DoubleLine has registered three mutual funds with the SEC, and it expects $10 billion in new accounts this spring. Gundlach says the most gratifying thing about the firing and its aftermath is that 45 people followed him from TCW -- proof, he says, that he isn't such a difficult guy to work with. As Gundlach walks through his new firm's offices, he looks happy. To reign there, it seems, is better than to serve at TCW. To top of page

73,2018-12-18,COMPUTER1313,1,Socially responsible funds that promise to align your money with your values are often more marketing than science.,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-18/exxon-great-marlboros-awesome-how-esg-investing-lost-its-way?srnd=premium

&gt; Investors who think they’re buying environmental, social, and governance funds—ESG for short—to promote a better world often wind up with costlier products that are, in almost every other respect, the same as any index fund. Criteria are so broad and disparate that companies as unlikely as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Philip Morris International Inc., the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, make the cut in some cases.

&gt; “There’s a lot of greenwashing,” says David Krysl. A 28-year-old data science analyst from San Diego, Krysl was one of those millennials motivated by the prospect of doing good when he went to invest about $10,000 of retirement savings.

&gt; After poring through scores of different options—many of which he found wanting—Krysl settled on a clutch of ESG funds from Nuveen, whose tag line reads: “Align your investments with your values.” But recently, he learned one ETF owns Coca-Cola Co.—which he says is sucking up water rights around the world. (Nuveen says Coke’s water-stress issues have been “less severe” than its peers, and the company scores highly on its carbon footprint and waste.) Krysl is considering moving his money again.

&gt; It’s not hard to see why. As fees tumble toward zero in the $3.5 trillion U.S. market for exchange-traded funds, asset managers are desperately trying to come up with new products to sell and more ways to generate revenue. Many have zeroed in on slicing and dicing the investment universe into ever more specific themes (see robotics ETFs), or styles such as momentum.

&gt; Though many funds are backed more by marketing than science, they all have one thing in common: higher fees, which firms say are justified because they do something more sophisticated than tracking the stock market.

&gt; Granted, ESG is still a tiny sliver of the fund universe. But the fees have money managers seeing dollar signs. Compared with the iShares Core S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF, which costs 0.03 percent, investors pay on average 15 times more for do-gooder ETFs. (Nuveen, which charges 0.2 percent to 0.45 percent, says its prices reflect a methodology that’s more akin to active management.)

&gt; That means an ESG fund managing $100 million can easily outearn a vanilla ETF that has over $1 billion in assets. With millennials such as Krysl projected to inherit some $30 trillion in coming decades, it’s no wonder ESG has become such a big deal. BlackRock, for instance, will introduce sustainability scores for more than 700 iShares ETFs early next year.

&gt; Take the $1.2 billion iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF. It promises “exposure to socially responsible” companies and can be used to “invest based on your personal values.” Yet a quick look shows it owns half the S&amp;P 500. A Vanguard ESG fund holds 4 out of every 5 stocks in that index.

&gt; The largest holding in a $22 million OppenheimerFunds ETF is Exxon Mobil, which has been accused by regulators of misleading investors about the cost of climate-change regulation. The fund, which buys companies with “best in class” ESG practices and shuns those that score poorly on controversies, also owns Philip Morris and at least three defense contractors. Oppenheimer says the companies garner above-average ESG scores, based on third-party research that specializes in sustainability analysis.

TL;DR: If you want to do socially responsible investing, look what's inside the ETF or mutual fund first."
74,2018-12-17,thvmarko,1,Screening for ETFs in a simple and elegant way made possible,"Number of ETFs in the US is on the constant rise. Their use case in the past has been to track a specific market, and past few years the emergence of smart beta and replication of various strategies became available to investors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The challenge has been how to get these products to investors in a streamlined and orderly way. The solution that the market currently has is the one that worked the best when it comes to big data sets and those are ETF screeners. You're offered a few filtration criteria, and after you input your filters you get the results. It's basically one massive Excel sheet with improved User Interface (UI). 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like there is an opportunity to simplify fields that are being filtered. Especially because most people do not know the meaning of some of these fields, and they create the confusion which ultimately results in people taking their money elsewhere. Also, instead of dealing with big data in filtration type of way, having a few questions that user answers, and then our data in the back end that gets processed offers users one to three choices given their inputs.

&amp;#x200B;

Once choices are offered, we connect with number of platforms that we have agreements in place for users to be able to execute trades directly through the API connections. This gives end to end experience, starting from looking for an ETF, processing the data in our back end, and execution. This technological solution to screening and investing assets is very new and any comments and suggestions are welcomed.
