0,2016-01-13,diogenes227,0,Last time here asked if Arch Coal (ACI) was nearing bankruptcy...,"...five months ago... 

The answer is yes.  It is done.  

*The holder of the second-largest reserve of coal in the U.S. filed for court protection Monday. The company said it has an agreement with a majority of its lenders to erase $4.5 billion in debt from its balance sheet and allow it to keep operating without interruption. Arch has been losing money since 2012.*

*“Over the past several years, a confluence of economic challenges and regulatory hurdles has hobbled the coal industry,” Arch Chief Financial Officer John T. Drexler said in a filing accompanying the Chapter 11 petition in St. Louis.*

3,2016-05-10,mutualdistrust,3,[Q] Decrypting mutual fund brochures,"I've been poring over brochures of mutual funds and the internet, trying to figure out what I can expect to make with different funds. I'm no expert when it comes to finance so any insight would be much appreciated!



[This pdf](https://www.sbimf.com/docs/default-source/equity-schemes---fund-cards---march-2016/sbi-magnum-balanced-fund) shows the past absolute returns for a balanced fund (pg 4) as:


* dec 2012- dec 2013: 11.86%
* dec 2013- dec 2014: 43.24%
* dec 2014- dec 2015: 7.36%



q1: are the 'Absolute Returns' the % of the principal investment an investor would have gained in, say, 2014-15? ie $10000 becomes 10736 at 7.36% AR?

q2: by the 'risk' of mutual funds, do they mean a hypothetical negative AR in 2014-15 (ie -7.36%) would be deducted from the principal investment ($10000) and become $9264?

5,2016-07-15,FCowperwood,1,"AR, VR and investing.","I couldn't find anything similar, so I decided to start my own thread. 
Our world is developing alongside our knowledge and skills. It was hard to imagine or predict the virtual world with its features, pros and cons; and now it becomes real. 
What do you think, guys, from our (investors) point of view, is there any reason to invest into VR and AR like GOOG, SNE, NVDA or lesser ones like GPRO and HIMX? Yes, I know that it can be a long shot, but do the VR and AR have their future? Will people actually get more interested in this sphere so we could get our profits of it? I'm interested in every opinion, even if you think that the idea totally sucks."
6,2016-07-11,SmoresPies,3,"As a speculative investor, how far off the worn road am I?","With the recent news of Nintendo's success with Pokemon GO, I can't help but revisit the ideas I see for the near future(within 5-10 years). And in trying to list them, I was curious as to what you guys believe the future holds, if you agree and possibly if you could shed some light on the areas I haven't considered.

I see a massive push towards renewable energy. People are calling Tesla's move on SolarCity a wash because it has no benefit. I disagree as I saw a similar argument being presented when Netflix said they were splitting their company and look how well that turned out for them.

Another area I see potential growth in is these AR/VR market segments. If GO is any indication what lies beyond the frontier of the mobile platforms true potential, the next couple years are going to send your head spinning. With this speculation in mind, I have considered 4k resolution cameras for future generation mobile devices, along with semiconductor manufactures, is there another area I should be looking into to capitalize on this upward trend?

With that in mind, I've started to look into optical transistors. From my understanding, this is the technology that will and quite possibly already has started to supersede fiber optics. Some are speculating this discovery will pave the way for quantum computing, as well as fast-as-light communication(no downloads, instantaneous streaming, no buffers, etc) However, most companies I've considered in this field, are either still in the R&amp;D phase or are in the process of buying smaller manufactures to make the transition when the time presents itself. I could be wrong, but this is one of the reasons why I believe it's taking Google as long as it has to roll out their fiber network but who knows, maybe there's more red-tape than I can comprehend. So given this area of technology will upend our current computing standards, am I better off looking at the big dogs like Sony, Samsung, Google, and other titans-- or, in the off chance, they aren't ready for this developed tech, should I follow these R&amp;D firms hoping to sign off on some larger than life partnership?

Lastly, I believe there is something interesting going on in the vein of pharmaceuticals, however, the industry is already well established. Although, with the legalization of marijuana and the pursued research in alternative medicines(ie LSD), I can't help but wonder what type of cures will come from such interests. I've also found a hard time locating the companies along the frontier of this directive, mainly because a lot of their press releases are medical mumbo-jumbo that sails over my head.

Anyway, to wrap this up, what do you guys think? Have I lost my mind? Am I onto something? What do you all believe?"

What I'm finding is a lot of VC funds basically saying ""Well yes if you have 5 million to invest"".  Are their not any mutual or ETF funds that strictly invest in AR &amp; VR that the average person can invest in?  Thank you! "
