0,2018-01-29,SergeantROFLCopter,0,Is this a smart strategy for working with early stage startups?,"Basically I would seek companies that extremely early stage and purchase options from them and offer consulting services. I am very technical (can prototype hardware, can program in ~20 languages, etc, am familiar with IoT techniques and Machine Learning, etc) and have early stage entrepreneur experience. Then I would guide them to angel groups or Y Combinator, etc.

So maybe I buy the option to buy 10% at $1,000,000 evaluation with a $10,000 premium. I would do this knowing what the $10,000 is going to be spent on, guiding them on how to spend it to get more investable.

Y Combinator buys in at a $1.7M and then those companies average at $9M only several months later.

1. The world’s biggest privacy regulation GDPR goes into affect May 25 2018. 

If there is one thing that people know about the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) it’s that GDPR fines (administrative fines) can go up to 20 million Euros or 4 percent of annual global (note global!) turnover, whichever of both is highest. 
https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdpr/gdpr-fines-guidelines-application-penalties/ 

Figure this one out: Just shy of 100 percent of U.S.-based privacy professionals believe the importance and complexity of managing privacy in their organizations is increasing. 

Similar numbers (97 percent!) acknowledge they will increase their investment in managing privacy. Yet fully 61 percent of these same professionals acknowledge they have done little to prepare for the coming of the world’s biggest privacy regulation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. What’s more, 99 percent admit to needing additional help in preparing for the GDPR.

2. DATA443 (OTCPK: LDSR) ClassiDocs Wins Numerous Industry Awards – GDPR 100 days awayPress Release | 02/13/2018 

RALEIGH, N.C., Feb. 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. is pleased to announce that its recent acquisition – ClassiDocs - has won prestigious industry awards for GDPR Compliance, Data Classification and Governance in the 2018 Cybersecurity Excellence Awards. 

Gold Winner 

“This is validation for the whole team. The volume of support we received from the community surprised us but does match the feedback we get from clients and partners – that the ClassiDocs product set is an on-point technology that facilitates many requirements of the upcoming GDPR legislation and provides for a unique and feature-rich Data Classification and Governance solution,” stated Mr. Remillard, CEO of DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. today. 

“Congratulations to DATA443’s product team for being recognized as the gold winner in three categories: Data Classification and Data Governance. The GDPR category – a new one this year – had the ClassiDocs GDPREngine product place first also as a gold winner,” said Holger Schulze, CEO of Cybersecurity Insiders and founder of the 400,000-member Information Security Community on LinkedIn that organizes the awards program. ""With over 400 entries in more than 70 categories, the 2018 awards are highly competitive and all winners truly reflect the very best in today's cybersecurity industry."" 

“We have worked very hard on our GDPR functions – adding capabilities that are grounded in true use cases and deliver immediate value to the client. Our forthcoming GDPREngine technology delivered in a SaaS model delivers GDPR compliance capabilities faster and with much less total cost of ownership for clients,” added Mr. Remillard. “We will be making this officially available for beta clients in the coming month – the GDPR Deadline is fast approaching – 100 days exactly today. We are seeing increased demand worldwide for capabilities – matching our initial analysis that GDPR applies more broadly than just the European Union.” 

About Cybersecurity Insiders 
The Cybersecurity Excellence Awards are organized and managed by the team at Cybersecurity Insiders – the same group that manages the 400,000+ member information security technology professional LinkedIn group. The organization also produces numerous webinars and deep industry research for all facets of information security. It is headquartered in Maryland, US. 

About DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. 
DATA443 Risk Mitigation, Inc. (OTCPK:LDSR) (https://www.data443.com) is a technology company that is actively developing and acquiring cyber-security products &amp; service offerings that are central to blockchain, cyber data security, GDPR, compliance and governance capabilities. The Company develops its own technologies and has an active acquisitions program in place. 



3. A majority of companies plan to use external firms to accelerate their GDPR preparation 
Because GDPR’s requirements are deep and complex, preparing for the new regulation requires buy-in and support from across an organization, including in areas are not used to dealing with privacy issues. In response, many companies plan to use external firms to help with their preparation. 

Among executives polled in this survey, 69% said they plan to use a technology firm to help with their preparations, 62% plan to hire a consulting firm, and 46% plan to hire a law firm. Roughly two-thirds of larger companies – those with greater than $500 million in revenues – say they will hire a consulting firm. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html






4. US companies lead their UK and Japanese counterparts in making steady progress in GDPR readiness 
With GDPR set to go into effect in May 2018, 11% of executives surveyed said their companies have now finished operationalized preparations. This tally is almost double the 6% that were finished last year. On the opposite side of the spectrum, the number of companies that have yet to even begin preparations has shrunk dramatically, from 23% last fall to just 7% in the most recent survey. 

Significant gaps remain, however. Of the companies surveyed, 36% said they have just started the assessment process, meaning their journey toward GDPR readiness has just begun. As a result, these organizations risk not being fully compliant by the May 2018 deadline, facing regulator fines, litigation costs, and lost contract opportunities in Europe. 

Compared to the UK and Japan, companies in the US have made the most progress toward compliance. Almost a quarter, or 22%, of US companies surveyed say they have finished GDPR preparations, compared to just 8% of UK companies and 2% of Japanese companies. 
https://www.pwc.com/us/en/increasing-it-effectiveness/publications/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-budgets.html 





Japanese companies plan to spend more to catch up to their US and UK peers 
US companies are further along in cross-functional areas than their counterparts in UK and Japan. Japanese companies, in particular, lag behind in several key areas, including data-lifecycle management, for which roughly one-in-five Japanese companies surveyed reported they have finalized implementation of preparations. Japanese companies are similarly behind in areas such as training, cross-border data strategy, and privacy incident management. 

Although Japanese executives report they are behind in several key GDPR preparation areas, they expect to spend significant amounts of money to catch up. The survey found 77% of Japanese companies plan to spend at least $1 million on GDPR projects, compared to 62% of US companies, and just 43% of UK companies.

5. Tech Giants Brace for Europe’s New Data Privacy Rules 

With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley’s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules. 

“Every person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,” said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. “G.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.” 
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/technology/europe-data-privacy-rules.html


EU GDPR – new rules, wider reach – the biggest change to data protection laws in 20 years 

End of implementation period 

After four years of negotiation, GDPR was finally adopted on 27 April 2016. It comes into effect after a two-year implementation period. One law firm has described it as the “most ground-breaking piece of EU legislation in the digital era” – and with good reason. It will make businesses more accountable for data privacy compliance and offers individuals extra rights and more control over their personal data. 

The GDPR does not need to be transposed into local law in each EU member state. This is a directly-effective regulation which will be immediately effective across the 28 countries, aiming to remove inconsistencies in how the data protection law is applied in Europe.

5,2018-04-13,haxamin,6,Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance—Now It Has a Challenger,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-long-dominated-startup-fundingnow-it-has-a-challenger-1523544804

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world’s financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money—mostly from China—has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did—40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal’s analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia’s share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world’s technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.


Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China’s venture market “signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly,” he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else—nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China’s bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia’s investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East “is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity,” says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. “If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that’s a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage.”

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. , which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world’s largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

Where the Money Goes
The U.S. and China invest largely within their own borders, while Japan bets heavily outside.




The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others’ products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns—startups valued at a billion dollars or more—at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal’s analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country’s own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country’s tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal’s analysis found.

The Race to Fund Indian Ventures
Chinese and Japanese investors are pouring money into India, channeling more venture money into the world's second-most populous country than U.S. financiers.


Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are “at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation,” says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan ’s Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba’s electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. “The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact.”

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India’s biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are “way far ahead of anything that’s happened in the U.S.” Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn’t had “meaningful” U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm’s online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China’s push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China’s state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing’s interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year’s amount, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year—up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China’s tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets “where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems.”

Picking Up the Pace
U.S. investors still lead a far greater number of venture deals than those of any other country.


Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create “chemistry” with others in the Alibaba group to “build long-term value,” Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

Rise of the Mega-Deal
Funding rounds of $100 million or more are now half of all venture finance.

“All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China,” he says.

“The U.S. approach is: We’ll build a better product and just win over all the countries,” says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is “we’ll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies.”

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal’s analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource’s records begin.

The Journal’s analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round’s investors.

China Bound
The amount of venture money flowing to Chinese companies is now approaching the amount going to U.S. companies.


Asia’s rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments—those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding—largely by SoftBank—came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups—such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year—is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse ’s lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India’s VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola’s parent.

Investing Across Borders
Venture investors are plowing increasing amounts of money into companies in other countries, with Asian investors leading the pack.


The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India’s biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba’s home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

“Think of strategic investments and M&amp;A as playing a game of go,” said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. “In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent.”"

NVID - 3%
AAPL - 7%
AMAZ - 7%
GOOG - 18%

I have been holding some GOOG shares since it was at ~840 and yesterday I added 6 more. 

I am not good at evaluating companies but when I look around GOOG is slowly taking over and there is still so much potential growth. 

1). Data - Google has so much data. It is INSANE. They know about billions of humans and their behavior, business, streets, pictures (with google photos) It is absolutely nuts. which brings me to my next two point (AI and Cars)

2). AI - we know that AI is going to be a huge part of our everyday life going forward. And with the amount of data GOOGLE has, they are on the TOP spot to leverage and make their AI the best. This isn't even an opinion right? FB, Microsoft, and Amazon doesn't even have fraction of data that Google has. And AI is all about machine learning, and the more data you feed, smarter it gets. 

3). Automobile- This is uncharted territory, no one has been able to penetrate and challenge the big car giants like GM, Toyota, Audi etc. Once Elon Musk was asked a question, who does he see as his competitor and his answer was Apple. I don't know if he was being ignorant or genuinely don't see Google as a major competitor.    

Google's approach to automobile is same as their approach to Android. They do what they do the best (create software and services) and let the hardware people make the hardware. Seems like they are on the same path with cars, they are creating the best selfdriving system and infrastructure and just going to sell this to other car manufactures, who already know how to build cars. And just like Pixel line up, we might see cars made by Google at some point. But the point is, how can anyone not see Google as a serious competitor is beyond my understanding. 

I still haven't talked about their new silicon initiative and IoT stuff. Its safe to say, it all looks very promising to me

What do you guys think about Google in general? Positive, negative or neutral?"

10,2018-06-25,Grey41,0,Feeling bummed. Looking for encouragement on my goals that don't really conform to those around me..,"Hey guys, it's my first post here. 

To introduce myself, I'm 22 and just graduated college with a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering. I'm proud of that accomplishment, but I really dont want to be another person in the workforce just doing 9-5. 

I really dont want to work for anyone. I want to be my own boss and dont want to have to depend on anyone to live. I want to make my own money.

I've learned as much as can about making my own money and having my money work for me

Over the past 6-8 months or so I have:

Invested $3000 in stocks and gained ~$600

Traded cryptocurrencies (market is down at the moment, but for a time I was up a lot lol)

Been learning how to profitably trade Forex. I threw $100 into a live account after trading simulated accounts for a while. I'm learning a lot, I feel like I have a lot of potential here.

Created a basic Android game in Unity similar to doodle jump (still needs work to complete)

Started learning programming, specifically Python. Wrote a program to automate accounting for my crypto trades for tax purposes. (I got like a million trades and it's a pain in the ass to try to figure out wtf is going on by hand)

Started learning Machine Learning algorithms with hopes to create a program (using the Python library Tensorflow) to learn trends and patterns to trade Forex for me

Been playing around with the idea of starting a blog. Maybe for Forex trading, who knows yet haha



Anyways, I guess by all this I just want to say that I love learning and I work very hard at whatever I'm passionate at. I've put a ton of hours into these things and they're kinda paying off (kinda sorta), but I guess I think about them more as investments to my knowledge than immediate results.

What I really want to do is make a lot of money (yes, get rich quick, I feel like a lot of people hate that because it's usually scammy), but I'm ready to put in the work. I want to do that in order to be able to do the things I really want afterwards and be free and independent. Not tied to NEEDING a job. I might work even if I dont need it, but I dont want to depend on the job...

I want to help people, especially children and the homeless. This is super important to me because my early life was very very bad. I want to help people who are where I was..

To help those people effectively though, the way I see it, money is power, you can do a lot more as a rich person than as a person working 9-5. I look at Bill Gates, he's funding malaria research and shit, he can get shit done, much more than he could as a regular employee at some big company.

I hope I don't sound like an asshole to anybody...

It's just when I tell people that I want to work for myself, and that i want to make my own money, they're doubtful. They look at me weird and start suggesting that if I want to ""really make something of it"", I should get involved with a big company, get into so and so industry, etc. Basically they suggest I do what I see most people doing: working 9-5 to make some person rich...

Its discouraging and makes me feel like my dreams are just that: dreams.

Just to clarify, my plan right now is to work as an engineer for 5 years, while working on my own ideas on the side. And after 5 years hopefully be knowledgable enough to break off and do my own thing and be successful.

I just feel discouraged and really want to connect with someone like minded as me. I feel the pressure to conform with what everyone I see around me doing, but in my heart that's not what I want. 

Thanks for reading my long ass post guys.

I appreciate y'all!

Machine learning and AI  would absolutely have impact on headcount reduction at a lower level. ER will see a significant impact of this trend as jobs for pattern recognition and data cleaning will no longer require an analyst. 

\-----

Howard Marks believes top investors can still thrive even as trading machines become more active in the financial markets.

""Computers can do an unmatched job dealing with the things that can be counted: things that are quantitative and objective. But many other things — qualitative, subjective things — count for a great deal, and I doubt computers can do what the best investors do,"" Marks said Monday in a note to clients entitled ""Investing Without People.""

Marks, whose firm, Oaktree Capital, had $121 billion of assets under management as of March, said computers can't do things such as meet and assess management teams, listen to venture capital presentations and look at buildings for real estate investments.

""The greatest investors aren't necessarily better than others at arithmetic, accounting or finance; their main advantage is that they see merit in qualitative attributes and/or in the long run that average investors miss,"" he said. ""And if computers miss them too, I doubt the best few percent of investors will be retired anytime soon.""

Marks is known for his prescient investment memos, which warned about the financial crisis and the dot-com bubble implosion.

The Oaktree co-chairman noted computers can help investors make more informed decisions, but they won't replace human insight.

""Computers, artificial intelligence and big data will help investors know more and make better quantitative decisions. But until computers have creativity, taste, discernment and judgment, I think there'll be a role for investors with alpha,"" he said.

Marks has a net worth of $1.9 billion, according to Forbes."

20,2018-09-27,eslerjm,1,Facebook as a Sales Platform: The case against everyone else," 

Written September, 2018 by James M. Esler

Before you read this, please visit [This Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf2W9PferpA)

The following relates to Facebook Inc and its subsidiaries. This article is not designed to recommend a buy/hold/sell position on the company.

**By the numbers**

The company currently trades at about 11 and 22 times its Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) sales and revenue over the last 12 months (respectively). From 2013 to 2017, Facebook revenue and earnings grew about 51% and 81% on average, per year (respectively). From the perspective of discounted cash flows, if the market price was static (or worse dropped) over the next three years and the company achieved a 50% CAGR, the 22x earnings multiple will be reduced to 6.5x. If the company achieved a 30% CAGR for the following 3 years after, the multiple reduces to 3x. However, that’s simply 6 years of cash flows discounted, and for a company that will be around indefinitely, the current price-to-earnings multiple is determined more than 90% by the earnings *after* the first 5 years. This is factored in to the price target (not included in this article). Additionally, the revenue per global user is about $5.97 per user currently (not including Instagram, Whatsapp, or Oculus VR). The current revenue heavily leans on Facebook’s controversial Pixel feature, though as you will see below, the revenue structure is likely to change significantly in the near term.

**Capital Structure and Expenses:**

The company’s capital structure has been very consistent since its IPO in 2012. Facebook hasn’t used bank money – only $2 billion of long term debt in the past 3 years (paid off almost immediately). Assets have increased about 48% on average every year for the past 5 years. The capital structure relies on the retention of internally generated profits. The only other deviation from the capital structure was a stock issuance for the Whatsapp acquisition (2014) – since then, the company has consistently bought back every year, including over $5 billion in Q2 2018.

With a TTM profit margin of nearly 40%, the company should not pay a dividend to shareholders. Facebook returns 25% per year to equity holders, and has increased free cash flow 51% on average each year over the past three years. The business model does not have any inventories (ex-Oculus), so cash generation is simpler and purer than many other businesses (including Amazon) – this is the reason accounts payable is an insignificant figure (&lt;$400 M). SG&amp;A at 18% of revenues in 2017, from about 23% in 2015. R&amp;D at 19% of revenue, from 27% in 2015. These are the main drivers of current bottom line growth and will likely continue to be. Margins will like continue to improve as Facebook continues to automate processes. The decrease in labor costs maybe from programs being able to replace employees.

**Regulation:**

Many investors believe regulation will compress Facebook’s margins, saying that litigation on grounds of data practices and even antitrust will erode earnings growth. Such positions are hard to justify, since Facebook competes in many circles, most notably against Google, Twitter, and Amazon.com. Further, the company does not charge users any fees, so it does not have the ability to ‘fix prices’. Litigation would be protracted if it did occur, though simple fines are much more likely. The Justice Department likely will not step in here for high profile trials. As you will see below, Facebook Inc is taking large steps to enhancing Pixel and encrypting data points to secure user data.

**Facebook and the future of shopping**

***In the near future, Facebook will be a leader in e-commerce globally.*** This will manifest through use of both Business to consumer (B2C) marketing and Rich Communication Services (RCS). Facebook consistently is making the buying experience easier, more secure, and less expensive (both monetarily and psychologically). We are in the early days of Facebook being a dominant business.

At this time, Facebook has a total of 1.47 Billion daily active users (DAU) using only Facebook (not Instagram, Whatsapp, or Oculus). Whatsapp has about 1.5 Billion daily active users, and Instagram has about 0.6 Billion DAU. On all of their platforms, Facebook Inc has about 2.5 Billion Monthly Active Users (MAU), and there is very little penetration in China at this time. Considering these numbers, about 40% of the world (ex-China) is on Facebook. For another reference point, Amazon has about 30 Million MAU (0.5% of global population). Facebook has created a social experience that does not cost anything and users receive tremendous value every single day from Facebook.com, Instagram, and Whatsapp. The users are generally able to make significant purchases, do most shopping online, and will shop at the market with the best prices/products. Thus, if Facebook can prove to its users that it can provide a better shopping experience than other online stores (Wal-Mart, Amazon, Etsy), it will be able to better connect businesses and consumers on the platforms. The better shopping experience will likely come from knowing the customer in depth, using prescriptive analytics to enhance the sales process for millions of goods and reducing the potential stresses of purchase decisions. Once achieved, Facebook will monetize by charging businesses a small markup on each customer interaction, though users will likely never pay a fee for the service explicitly.

**Main Ecosystem**

To the untrained eye, it would appear that Facebook acquired Instagram, Whatsapp, and Oculus for more users and possibly synergies. A commonly held belief is that Facebook made these acquisitions to harvest user data to sell to advertisers. Seems that very few people are unsure what Facebook has planned for these acquisitions currently, let alone in the future.

**Whatsapp** – how does it fit in? Whatsapp is the largest rival to traditional SMS texting that comes standard on mobile phones (ie Android SMS, Apple chat). Whatsapp currently supports Rich Communication Service (RCS, see generations summary below), which allows large files to be sent seamlessly without compromise. Whatsapp also uses end-to-end encryption over wi-fi so no one can see the message outside the sender and recipient (not the service provider or Facebook either). The end-to-end encryption will soon prove to be the largest competitive advantage for Facebook as an e-commerce company and also will give users confidence that Facebook Inc is a good steward of their data. Businesses selling to Facebook users need to ensure that the sales process is protected from malicious actors (ie hackers) because sensitive information will be sent over Whatsapp, including forms of payment from the user, and products from vendors (such as airline tickets). At this time, there are 1.5 Billion DAU on Whatsapp, and many of them business owners, making a strong case for B2C marketing. Whatsapp for business simply changes your Whatsapp account to a business account and now you can begin marketing with all of your original Whatsapp contacts. Your contacts can then share all of your business information with others very easily and in one place. From there, Whatsapp provides you free chatbots to communicate with clients. Facebook Inc’s Messenger App has very similar features to Whatsapp, though Messenger has only about 1 Billion MAU since spinning off just before the IPO.

**Facebook** – how does it fit in? Facebook is a leader in data aggregation, analytics, and prediction mostly on consumers, but increasingly on businesses. The longstanding idea has been to be able to ***prescribe*** what users want before they even know, based on data from its massive user population. This is prescriptive analytics, and it is the holy grail of advertising – with the potential to revolutionize the shopping experience. To be brief, prescriptive analytics in the 3rd (and final) level of data analytics, allowing for conditional probabilities to determine each step in a given process. Thus, machines will put users in touch with businesses based on the users’ preferences, and in theory, the buying process should be very easy based on millions of iterations of the same transaction.

The two drivers of purchasing on Facebook: Facebook Market place and ads in the news feed. The market place (which launched October 2016) will allows consumers to search for products specifically and the feed allows vendors to push to consumers. In both cases, the consumer will click the advertisement and begin a Whatsapp chat (see link at the beginning of this article).

**Instagram** – how does it fit in? Very similar to Facebook above, while also using RCS very efficiently. Vendors show up with images and video advertisements in the feed and also in the ‘stories’ section. Users click on the vendor and can now communicate directly to the vendor. With Instagram TV (IGTV, launched July 2018), Instagram is attempting to add a YouTube mimic. YouTube currently has over 1.8 Billion MAU and has a large head start on IGTV, though YouTube is generally a destination for users, rather than a social square. Facebook Live is a very similar product: both of these ventures will be expensive in the short term as the company pays influencers to attract users away from YouTube. Interestingly, Instagram still has room to grow, since it is increasing market share every year from its rival Snapchat, which still has 188 Million DAU.

**Oculus** – how does it fit in? Hang out with your friends virtually. This brings a new dimension to ordinary conversation. The long term goal of the acquisition is *most likely* to have the experience of trying products before you buy them. Also, VR gives a stronger attraction to users getting on Facebook’s platform, since users will find it even more convenient to know what peers and influencers are doing. The VR market has not taken off– Oculus likely has years of sunk R&amp;D and talent acquisitions costs ahead of it until costs scale down. 6g has been rumored to support peer-to-peer AR/VR.

**Summary of network communication types (ie generations):**

SMS (1g, 2g)– short messaging services, analog and digital. This service represented the entire mobile phone market from around 1980 until the early 21stcentury, and still is dominant in developing countries. The 3rd generation of mobile networks allows for much enhanced Multi-Media files to be transmitted user to user.

MMS (3g, 4g)– Multi-Media Services for the transmission of images and videos. This has been prevalent in developed economies for just over a decade, and was made possible by larger network infrastructure that led to expense scaling. While this service is an upgrade to SMS, there are still shortcomings, including file size limitations. Often, images and videos must be compressed, which is becoming more common with continuous mobile phone camera improvements. 4g allows for improved wi-fi connectivity.

RCS (wi-fi, 5g)– Rich Communication Services for easier transmission of very large files. This generation was first created in 11/2016 and is very limited currently. Many network providers do not support RCS for problems with expense scaling (AT&amp;T and Vodafone do). At the end of 2018, beginning 2019, this service will become much more ubiquitous in developed nations, allowing for quicker, larger messaging capabilities. Thus, vendors will find it much easier to send “push” advertisements, products, receipts and consumers to “pull” large files from sites, vendors, and peers seamlessly. 5g may advance to make peer-to-peer AR/VR less expensive and attainable.

**Current sales cycle (in general terms):**

Suppose you are interested in buying a bed. You research online about beds.

The micro-decisions to make:

·  Where do you do the research and is it valid?

·  Price

·  Payment method

o  Cash

o  Credit

·  Sizes,

·  Interior design styles to match the rest of your home

·  What your friends have bought

·  What store to buy from

o  Online

o  Physical Location

§  Drive time

§  Sales pressure

·  Method, timing and cost of delivery

·  Complementary pieces (for each of these, repeat all above micro decisions)

o  Mattress

o  Sheet sets

o  Blankets

o  Bedside tables

o  Dressers

The current sales process (above) includes over 60 micro decisions for simply buying a bed. This raises a few very important points:

1.  Many consumers will avoid buying a bed and keep what they have, even if they are uncomfortable

2.  Mistakes can happen at any of the decisions.

3.  Psychological stress can arise from buyer’s remorse if mistakes are made. Also stressful if there was a missed opportunity (FOMO)

4.  Psychological stress can arise from avoiding the purchase and living uncomfortable

Machines can make the buying process easier by way of prescriptive analytics. Consumers will soon understand this is true because the true costs are the time these decisions take and also (most importantly) the *stress* of making all of these little decisions. The stress may come from inability to make decisions (paralysis by analysis) and/or living with poor buying decisions (buyer’s remorse and FOMO).

If you research beds online, Facebook (through its “Pixel” feature) will have popups for stores you can buy from almost immediately after you research . This technique is called ‘retargeting’ and is one of the largest competitive advantages of the Facebook platform. At this time, retargeting is very awkward and unwanted. Retail stores (and Amazon) get the majority of all traffic because it feels natural to pick something on your own.

The general idea of machine learning is to help us make all decisions easier. We are still at the beginning of machine learning – only a small fraction of buying decisions (both residential and commercial) around the world are handled by machines currently. *However*, as new generations find that all decisions can be made by machines, and that by this, the consumer has a more convenient, more efficient, and overall less expensive shopping experience, sales traffic will only be online. We are likely a long way off from this, though e-commerce growth numbers clearly show we are moving in such a direction.

**Future of sales:**

If you are considering buying a bed, you search the Facebook marketplace for vendors. When you find one you like, you can begin discussing the options through Whatsapp directly (as detailed in above segment). With its Pixel feature, Facebook Inc. will maintain advantages over competitors by providing the vendor with troves of information about you as the customer. There are hundreds of quantitative data points and several qualitative data points at the disposal of vendors and users right now, though the growth of these data points will rise logarithmically until a plateau stage (several years away). Vendors are strongly encouraged to make their offering as detailed as possible so that Facebook can create better, more personalized user audiences, and visa versa.

In the near term, the consumer will become more confident that his/her data is being properly secured (ie end-to-end encryption) and will enter the sales process increasingly from social media platforms/RCS providers where they visit each and every day. Prescriptive analytics will guide the consumer toward a fitting product; however, this sales process may not be prescriptive enough until the longer term. The coordination of quantitative and qualitative data points across millions of products will eventually lead to better fitting product recommendations.

**E-Commerce example: Amazon vs. Facebook**

Whichever company knows more about you will have an easier time getting your business. This includes your friendships, your family members, your socioeconomic status, your state of health, your demographics, your personality etc. Users go on Facebook to understand their world and friends better, which is a very strong value add that is showing increasing strength year over year.

Users go to Amazon for the sole purpose of shopping, which will likely be harder to maintain because users do not get anything out of the platform outside of purchases. This traffic-generation model may not be as sustainable as that of Facebook Inc. Amazon does, in fact, have many bolt-ons like Whole Foods, Twitch, Music, Alexa, etc. so that users are stickier. Currently, very few of Amazon’s potential sales centers make a durable profit margin over 3% (ie Whole Foods is still losing money). Based on many commentaries, users are indifferent to *where* they buy something, as long as they have the most convenient, least expensive shopping experience.

Facebook’s product has durability since the user’s peers and influencers (Instagram) are constantly posting things of interest to that user. Case in point: Amazon has 30 Million Monthly users, while Facebooks platforms have estimated over 2.5 Billion. To put that in perspective– monthly, for every 1 visitor to Amazon, there are over 85 visitors to Facebook platforms. Facebook currently has a 41% net profit margin (Amazon \~ 5%) with about $22 Billion in earnings (Amazon \~ $5.5). A big advantage for Facebook from a financial perspective is that it controls no inventories, preferring to act as a toll road for B2C transactions. Amazon, however, has distribution facilities, warehouses, and many low-level employees that have the potential to reduce long term profitability.

Amazon does not have a messaging application or social media platform yet. Facebook can meet the consumer where they are rather than having the consumer come into the Amazon store. Importantly, many vendors are not comfortable yet listing on Amazon, since Amazon owns the client, essentially, and can (not to say it would) cut the vendor out of the sale. Facebook allows vendors to simply have access to consumers and data to improve the sales cycle.

In summary, the purveyor that knows more about the consumer and can execute at the lowest applicable prices will win.

21,2018-09-04,Daddyku,0,Nvidia and Qualcomm are 2 of the best tech stocks,"Nvidia is going to replace Netflix in the FAANG stocks. 

Netflix focuses on digital movies and tv shows and their original content has been great. I think their stock will continue to go up in the near future, but without other innovation I think the big hitter is going to be Nvidia.

Their Hardware (GPUs) and software (Cuda) come at a perfect time when machine learning, AI, Pc gaming and crypto mining are literally at the early crescent stages of popping off. 

Qualcomm is working on next gen chipsets compatible with AI and VR and is making waves with 5G LTE which will further enhance smart cities and The IoT experience. 

These stocks are highly undervalued trailblazers and there has never been a better time than now to be All In tech stocks. "

24,2018-11-13,techreview,1,Meet the Robot Who Knows How to Trade Bonds Better Than You Do,"Bloomberg reports on a virtual assistant called Abbie that picks the best bonds for traders to buy or sell. ***Would you trust it?*** 

**What is it?** The bot, built by asset managers AllianceBernstein Holding, scans millions of data points within seconds to find potential trades and suggest them to the company’s portfolio managers. It can find bonds people may have missed, spot human error, and communicate with other bots, [Bloomberg reported today](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-12/meet-the-robot-who-knows-how-to-trade-bonds-better-than-you-do). The original version was launched in May 2018 and handled bond trades worth nearly $19 billion in the first three months. But it was far more limited and needed more precise instructions from human traders.

**Why it matters:** Abbie already supports over 60% of AllianceBernstein’s fixed-income trades. The fixed-income market, which basically trades debt, is one of the most important elements of the global financial market. However, humans still make the final decisions and execute trades based on Abbie’s recommendations.

**A growing trend:** Abbie’s rise in the bond market is symptomatic of the emerging role of AI software within companies, helping to inform people’s decisions by scanning data at a much faster rate and higher volume than they ever could. For example, machine-learning discovery tools are [already doing some of the heavy lifting](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609556/lawyer-bots-are-shaking-up-jobs/) that used to be a job for paralegals at law firms.

If AI is the future, and in order to train AI via machine learning, you need GPUs which are more effective than CPUs in this case, why are stocks of NVDA and AMD not increasing? Is it because of the recent news of chip demands going down?"

For example, if I have an indicator (from fundamental analysis, not TA) and I think this indicator predicts some stock success, is there any way to test and get recommendations on this in a point and click interface? 

The reason I ask is because if it doesn't exist or is done poorly at the moment - I would like to build such a tool for the masses"
27,2018-12-26,kikipi,1,Using Artificial Intelligence to set-it-and-forget-it,"We all know that 75% of stock exchanges happen using AI. We’re constantly trying to beat the system with our predictions, while we’re literally being suckers to AI.

I know some of us love creating diagrams/lines over charts and analyzing bell curves at 9AM. To them, props for following your passion.

But I’m wondering if there’s a known machine learning software out there that I could just set a daily allowance to, and forget it. Ideally it would scan through 100s of news articles in the evenings/mornings, check every stock prices (close and open) in the morning, and make the best mathematical predictions for me to buy. Then, sell faster than anyone else once my preferred cap was reached. Or when it predicts it will be the highest.

If not an AI which can go through the news, at least just for analysis of all numbers to automatically buy and sell for me.

I’m not saying this will be 100% accurate, but even just at 80% it would be amazing.

Are only banks allowed to use these softwares, or are there some released to the public as well?"
28,2018-12-21,ExternalCry,1,"Nvidia, oversold and great potential, the buy of a lifetime?","For those of us who missed the Nvidia ($NVDA) train earlier this year, where it hit near $300, this seems like a great opportunity to go back in. It has fallen a ridiculous amount in the past several months and is now trading near $135. I am seriously considering using leverage to invest a considerable sum ($200k+) into Nvidia. It's chips are in use by self-driving cars, the machine-learning industry, and hard-core gamers. I do not see them losing out anytime soon.

What does this sub think about Nvidia? Why will it succeed, or why will it fail? "
29,2018-12-10,ilikepancakez,1,Alphabet’s Waymo is revving up to become a $100 Billion Business,"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/12/09/alphabets-waymo-is-revving-up-to-become-a-100-bill.aspx

Not only is self-driving going to be just as or even more profitable than advertising, it’s far more future proof and indicative that Google’s choice in diversifying into a conglomerate like Berkshire Hathaway as Alphabet through alpha oriented bets continuously pipelined from their R&amp;D divisions is finally paying off. 

Where other tech companies have largely stagnated and fallen off from their prime (i.e. Oracle/Cisco/IBM/etc.) or have taken the largely safe and ultimately limiting path of expanding only to their nearest adjacent markets (i.e. Facebook/Apple/Amazon), Google has had the foresight and vision to look beyond any one market or strategy and realize that it’s true potential/moat lies in the exceptionally talented engineering workforce and pipeline it’s been able to cultivate over the years. With Larry and Sergey continuing to be at the helm, I strongly believe the perspective they have coming from a PhD engineering background has allowed Alphabet to build up huge advantages by understanding and capitalizing on the sheer exponential power and growth that technology creates. 

There’s a reason why Alphabet is so far ahead in the self driving race. Because when everyone was ridiculing and making fun of them for wasting money on “toy projects” like self driving cars 10 years, they were the only ones with the foresight and knowledge with their heads down seriously working on the problem. Similarly, when DeepMind was acquired by Alphabet, again it shows just how well they understand what the future will be. 

A monopoly on machine learning / AI, is de facto a monopoly on *everything*, and Alphabet in my opinion is truly the most well prepared in reaching such a goal. Self-driving is just the start too. Look to Alphabet’s life science and computational biology divisions like Verily or Calico, to see the next area of investments, which will soon start paying off."
