I was wondering if anyone else has been looking into this and has any other companies that might be making significant breakthroughs in this area. "
2,2016-12-29,marauderpete,1,2017 Portfolio,"Figured I'd post my picks for 2017 with a small snippet for each. My strategy is purchasing dividend aristocrat stocks from the big sectors and adding any value stocks of well established companies that have 3-4% dividend yields, along with several small and mid-cap growth stocks. I also buy industry leaders or companies with a lot of potential i.e TSN or HRL. My top 5 allocation percentages are Consumer Staples (19%), Industrials (16%), Financials (11%), Consumer Discretionary (11%), Technology (10%). Going long on all of these FYI.

Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome. I am fairly new to investing (3 months) but I have done my DD on all of these picks with their financials so I won't go in too much into the numbers aspect. I also prefer to purchase companies that I know about or use their products or services often, and that is reflected in a majority of these picks. 

**Materials**

Scotts Miracle Gro- Mid cap exposure, Bank of America upgraded it from ""hold"" to ""buy"" this month with a $105 target. It is in a very cyclical sector and most of their revenue will be made in the spring and summer months with their garden and lawn care products. Also a weed play I guess I'll throw that in there... 

Dow Chemical- One of the first stocks I purchased, one year price targets I've looking at have DOW as high as $72 and stock price is expected to grow at least 7% each of the next 5 years. Large market cap company providing services to many consumer markets and has a wide moat.

Huntsman Corp- Don't remember how I found this mid-cap stock but company reported $0.38 earnings per share for Q3 2016, topping estimates of $0.36 by $0.02. This company sells polyurethanes, performance products, and pigments for big companies such as BMW, Chevron and Proctor

**Consumer Discretionary**

Home Depot- Industry home supplies and improvement leader, more Americans are buying homes as well. Sales and profit are at record highs and same store sales are up 6%. In my opinion Home Depot is much better than it's competitors Lowe's and Menards. Since it is also dependent on the housing market 2017 should bode well for this retailer.

Walt Disney- Huge conglomerate, Star Wars is making them money, ESPN is not, but exploring options for cord cutters and I am optimistic they will do so

Shake Shack- Introduced breakfast menu along with mobile ordering app which is doing great and they just opened their 100th store this year with more to come in 2017. They only open stores in high foot traffic areas such as malls or city centers. For example, they will be opening up a Shack in the middle of Wrigleyville in 2019. Total revenue increased 40% in Q3 2016 with same store sales up 2.9%

Under Armour- Growth stock near year lows, high potential to eat into market share of Nike, Addidas. Has notable endorsements from Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Bryce Harper. They also have a deal with MLB starting in 2020 to supply all the uniforms. They have great athletic wear based on my experience.

**Financials**

Discover Financial Services- Great credit cards and customer service and since they are a bank as well they offer services such as saving accounts and student loans which many students use and something they will continue to push. It was between Discover and Visa for me and I think the former has more growth potential going forward.

CitiGroup- Big 4 bank which I think is undervalued by many. Will be one of beneficiaries of higher interest rates. 

SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF- Regional bank exposure, more people will be getting mortgages as rates keep rising and banks will make more money on higher interest rates

Bank of America- Bought in at $17, big bank, low P/E lot of cash on hand and will benefit the most out of the big 4 banks due to rising interest rates.

**Telecom**

Verizon Communications- Industry leader, many cell towers and coverage and will lead the charge into 5G networks

**Energy**

Chevron- Dividend Arisocrat, bullish price target set at $130

Exxon- Dividend Aristocrat, Tilleron as new SOS helps as well in helping negotiate with other countries knowing what would benefit the industry domestically and abroad

**Industry**

3M- Industry leader and dividend aristocrat, we use their products every day without even knowing it i.e. post its

Stanley Black and Decker- Great power tools and locks, mid-cap exposure, more home buying will result in increased demand for tools used for remodeling and construction.

Waste Management- People create garbage and someone needs to take it. Industry leader

CSX Corp- Railroad exposure. With Trump promising infrastructure improvements nothing is more cheaper and efficient to carry supplies and materials than by rail.

General Electric- Glad they sold off their financial unit, they can focus on what made them a huge conglomerate. Good price and portfolio must have in my opinion.

**Technology**

Microsoft- Entry into the cloud market will be big, their Surface computers are nothing to sneeze at either.

Intel- Great computer chips, always use them and they will be releasing new chips in 2017. AMD and NVDA do not scare this industry leader.

Activision Blizzard- Great yearly titles such as Call of Duty and WoW. Bit down this year but their entry into E-Sports will be big.

Cisco- Industry leader in office phones, communication equipment, reputable, good dividend.

**Consumer Staples**

PepsiCo- I picked this over Coca-Cola because there is better diversity within PepsiCo in their snacks business. People are also eating healthier which is why brands such as Tropicana and Quaker within the PepsiCo portfolio will give them that extra boost.

Kraft Heinz- Who doesn't love ketchup and cheese? This merger was helped by names such as Berkshire Hathaway &amp; 3G Capital. Buffet's largest holding as well.

Proctor &amp; Gamble Co- Heavyweight industry leader offering us products such as Bounty, Tide, and Crest toothpaste. People use their products every day. 

Tyson Foods- Purchased the dip, they are an industry leader and I am certain they will bounce back in the long-term.

Hormel Foods- Mid cap stock. Net profit has steadily increased last couple of years, their acquisition of Justin's LLC who specialize in nut snacks and SPAM maker Applegate will turn out to be a revenue producer in the coming years.

**Healthcare**

Johnson &amp; Johnson- Dividend Aristocrat around since 1886. They sell most of the household items we use every day such as Tylenol, band aids, and baby products. These guys are here to stay.

Pfizer- Great dividend stock to keep purchasing. Healthcare was a little beat up this year but with the Trump administration promising less drug regulations companies like PFE have the potential to grow their revenue moving forward.

**Utilities**

Brookfield Infra Str Partners Lp- Spinoff from Brookfield Asset Management. Has subsidiaries in the energy, transportation, utilities and communication sectors in US, UK, Australia and Canada. Not a pure utility stock but has it's fingers in a wide array of sectors and is expected to increase it's cash flow by 9% next year. 4.65% div yield as well.

**ETFs**

Vanguard Russell 2000 Growth Index Fund- Mirrors the small-cap growth stocks in the Russel 2000 index. Up 9% this year and potential for more gains in a business friendly Trump administration.

PowerShares S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF- Pays a monthly dividend which is great and contains companies such as CME Group, GM, Ctipillar, HCP. 0.3% expense ratio


**Watchlist:** 

SHW, KMI ,ADP ,WBA ,ABT ,CAH, MCD, F ,HPE ,ENB ,WLL ,COST ,ABBV ,HEP ,MRO , CVS, MWA ,RDS.B ,IPS

3,2016-12-18,marketnator,2,Thoughts on Nokia?,"Is it a good idea to start adding shares of nokia to my account? My biggest interest in the company is the release of 5G networks and I would like to start stockpiling shares of these long before it is released. I'm fully aware that the company makes terrible phones, but I believe their cell towers alone after the acquisition of Acatel Lumina should make them competitive whenever 5G networks are released. Is this a sound investment strategy?"
4,2016-12-15,AZK47,1,Has anyone thought of building out Utilities and Telecom in their portfolio?,"I'm a bit weary of this market and want to move to safer stocks that are recession proof. I have chosen Duke Energy as my utility stock based on #s and this article :http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/12/the-top-utility-stock-to-buy-for-2017.aspx

I've been researching Telcom names and I haven't pinpointed a particular one that stands above the rest. ATT and V are the big players and have the cash for future-proofing invesments (5G) but are losing subscribers to Tmobile. Any thoughts? What if I chose an ETF and bet on the entire industry? Any recommendations here?

Here is another article I am using for post-hike trends: http://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks:-what-to-expect-when-the-fed-hikes-200168978

I got lucky and positioned into Financials and Home Builders before the Trump run. I've also bought some big named tech post-election so I think they can still grow from their lows. As always, a few speculative and biotech plays that have blown up in my face but I feel like they are taking over my portfolio.

Any advice is appreciated
