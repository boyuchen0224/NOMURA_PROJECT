I am a 21 year old college student about to graduate and my only investments currently are in cryptocurrency. My cryptocurrency investments are now worth between 30%-50% (very volatile) of my total net worth. I have no debt and fully payed off my last semester of college. I would like to diversify the risk of my portfolio and initially wanted to put money in an S&amp;P 500 index fund, but I heard that we may be entering a bear market. If we are potentially entering a bear market, where would be the best place to invest my money? Otherwise, please explain why we would not be entering a bear market and why my investment into an index fund would be a good choice right now.

The motivation for this is my friends are strongly recommending I buy into cryptocurrency.  The only previous investment experience I have is making automatic contributions to my Roth IRA.  In that, my money is entirely in an S&amp;P tracking index fund.^1  So I'm treading cautiously with cryptocurrency.  One recurring theme I keep seeing during my research is 'speculation versus investment,' so I think it would be prudent to read up on this, see how it applies to my case, and make a decision accordingly.

Thanks in advance.

12,2018-01-22,wait_whatamidoing,2,Sociological trends with regards to value investing,"Sociological trends can be regarded as one of the few things that allow the common man to find good value in this market. I'm not discounting the effectiveness of quants or assigning value to companies based upon well establish equations. But some of that inherently is speculation, due to the fact one of the variables in those equations would be future projections of revenue. Future revenue that is largely driven by sociological trends.


The market is very efficient with crunching numbers. But overall, I'd argue that traders aren't the most astute people with regards to understanding what others will do. A general weakness of economics, and something thats been studied quite a bit in the last few decades.


How many iPhones will be sold, how fast will Facebook/Netflix/Amazon grow their user base, how many people will be purchasing self driving cars into the future, how many people will continue to get into the crypto currency market, will people continue to move their business away from retail stores into the online space, how quickly and to what degree will smart-houses/the internet of things catch on, how prominent will videogames or sports be into the future, how quickly/to what degree will people purchase solar panels for their houses, how quickly/to what degree will electric cars catch on, how quickly will the infrastructure and laws required to govern these new technologies be created and implimented, how quickly will Virtual Reality catch on. You get the idea.


All of these are speculative. You can't create an equation to perfectly predict these things. Perhaps in the future that will change. But currently, people can't know the answer to these things. Its just guesses. Guesses that people try their best to turn into a variable and add in to their equations, but as I said, its inherently speculative, and its fairly rare that someone is both a quant and a sociologist. Two very different fields of expertise.


I think if you reflect upon the history of the last few decades and consider some of the biggest value investing plays, many of them were due to a misunderstanding of the sociological aspect of a company or product. Cryptocurrency being tied to the growing distrust of governments and large institutional banks, for example. Netflix, and people not understanding how popular it would be to get access to all this (commercial free) entertainment on their computers instead of theaters/TV. Facebook/other social media exploding in users, to the extent some people are arguing it should be treated as a public utility. Big data and people miss-valuing what you can do with it, in regards to marketing, with that much information on your consumers.


I'd appreciate your thoughts, if you made it to the end of this. "

16,2018-01-19,eduardonachocamacho,0,Question on if I'm understanding cryptocurrency correctly after self education.,"I chose to dive into the history and use of Bitcoin mainly, because it seems to be the most consistently popular transaction method within the crypto world. Having done so I came away with my own conclusions, and perhaps they're obvious but given that the system is ""new"" (relatively speaking in terms of popularity), I wanted to share and also see if my assumptions are correct or not. 

So the creation of the currencies themselves strike me as the strangest part of the whole system, specifically the creation of Bitcoin itself. It has the original created blockchain itself, but then the subsequent uses of the forking method seem to be almost illimitable, in theory. With each fork not only affecting the value of the currency itself but also the method by which that value is derived (as for as I understand it, mainly through the various mining techniques which are added or subtracted in each of these forking events). 

Bitcoin was also created with a circulatory limit in mind, which I also found interesting. At which point this circulation limit is reached, then the value of the currency is dictated purely by the transactions which occur, which is not the case now. As far as investing goes, this seems to be the only place which could, theoretically, be reached where market speculation is even fundamentally feasible. Am I wrong in this thinking? (this is also a far away limit, mind you. I don't have the exact figure at hand)

It also appears the market is ripe for manipulation with mining techniques - another way of obtaining currency within the system - available in ways which lack much firm regulation. 

Basically I came away fairly dubious on the whole market be sustainable at all, at least as to how it relates to our current base currency (I don't even want to get into foreign markets). But I'd be happy to be proven wrong, because I may be and suspect I'm missing something.

Let me know if there's any you want to add to the list. Hope this helps!

FWIW, I like investing from a macro theme, so I probably have a bias towards podcasts that have a lot of macro, but I try to keep an open mind and keep other podcasts on my list as long as I can learn from them. I don't have patience for interviewers that talk more than their guests or try to sell stuff like their books constantly. I also don't really keep a lot of podcasts on my list that are too beginner level because I find myself getting bored, but depending on where you are in your learning, they can definitely be helpful!

Adventures in Finance|[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/adventures-in-finance-a-real-vision-podcast/id1210383304?mt=2) ‖ [PocketCasts](http://pca.st/RvVh)|60|[38 – Black Monday: First Hand Accounts of the 87 Crash](http://pca.st/wxl3)|From the same guys that made RealVision. The hosts have a bearish view on the US economy and so do a lot of their guests, but they do an okay job of bringing on an opposing view as well. Their focus is more macro-themed, but since they're bringing on a lot of different guests, you will have some that run their money in terms of value or momentum or a million other things. Overall good variance if you don't really know which school of though you follow yet.|
Bigger Pockets|[iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/biggerpockets-podcast-real-estate-investing-wealth/id594419649?mt=2) ‖ [PocketCasts](http://pca.st/b0yN7h)|60-90||Probably one of the best podcasts for real estate investing. I'm not an avid listener but I've listened to 20-30 episodes (they have hundreds). They have everyone from tax attorneys to home flippers, to apartment building owners, to shopping mall owners come on and explain their process. Really informative if you want to figure out what kind of real estate investing is for you.|

His guests are also more relatable--people who trade based on their edge, but mostly smaller accounts (relatively speaking). Not a whole lot of value guys, this one is more algo/quant focused but still varied. There are some bigger guests as well, if you like that.|

Therefore, I have the same description for both. These guys are great interviewers, have a lot of big names in finance, and even venture out to startups and management at times. Good light listening, but there's not a whole lot that you're going to start applying to your investing immediately.|

The host is a hedge fund manager that started off as a software engineer. He trades oil futures, so spends the first 20 minutes or so going through his ""market wrap"" which is his personal commentary on oil, USD, gold, and the S&amp;amp;P 500. If you're not into all that, skip to about 20 minutes in for the feature interviews. These are all macro themed (duh!). Host has a clear bearish bias on the US but he tends to ask a question and get out of the way to let the guest talk, so I enjoy it.|

If you want to give it a go anyway, start with Episode 152 with Suze Orman. I had no idea who this chick was bt I read the description to this episode that claimed that women are better investors than men. Coming from a science/medicine background, this wasn't surprising, women are much better at keeping their emotions in check when necessary but also better at gauging emotions of others. I though she was going to lay down some science and tell us *why* women are better so that maybe we could learn, but nope, she goes on an hour long rant about why men suck.

He is still a good interviewer, but his guests tend to either agree with his bias, or at least not disagree strongly. One unique thing about the host is that he looks at macro starting with energy and building up from that, which is different that what you get in a lot of other podcasts.|

China is to release monthly trade and inflation data, while the U.K., traders will be awaiting a report on manufacturing production for further indications on the continued effect of Brexit on the economy.
Quarterly earnings season kicks off with eight companies on the S&amp;P500 this week.


**TRUMP - THE NEXT MOVE**

Looking to boost domestic energy production, Friday the Trump administration has proposed opening nearly all U.S. offshore waters to oil and gas drilling, including in the Atlantic, Arctic and Pacific oceans. That would reverse the Obama-era order placing 94% of the Outer Continental Shelf off limits to drillers.


**CRYPTO**

Prices retreated from last week’s record highs after Coinbase, one of the largest exchanges for cryptocurrencies said that it has not made a decision to add new currencies to its platform. This dried out recent speculation that it would include Ripple. Ripple now has a market cap of $130 billion, in second place behind Bitcoin. Ripple sells blockchain technology, powered by its own cryptocurrency XPR, to banks and payment providers and other financial institutions to speed up cross-border payments.


**GOOGLE’s CHINESE PRESENCE**

Google made an undisclosed deal in China on E-sport streaming, with gaming live-stream company Chushou. There are other investors as well. Chushou has around eight million streamers and 250.000 live streams per day. Google’s search engine is blocked in China and the tech giant has used investments as a way to broaden its presence in the market.  - Google took a minority stake in Chinese AI startup Mobvoi in 2015 during a $75 million fundraising round.


**GREED INDEED**

Verizon has pulled Bloomberg TV from its offerings for 4.6 million subscribers, after being asked to pay for the content. VZ's argument is that Bloomberg is making the content available to all consumers for free via web and mobile app, and that it shouldn't have to pay carriage fees.


**VW IS STILL THE BEST**

Volkswagen group sales rose to around 10.7 million cars last year, keeping the German behemoth ahead of its Japanese competition as the world's largest automaker. The report came as Ron Stach, senior vice president of sales at Volkswagen of America, left the company. U.S. sales rose 5.2% to 339,676 brand models last year but dropped 19% in December as the carmaker shifted focus to its homeland.


**TECHIES**

The tech industry's biggest conference - The CES -, this week from Tuesday to Friday. Speakers include Ford (F) CEO Jim Hackett, Verizon CTO (VZ) Hans Vestberg, Qualcomm (QCOM) President Christiano Amon, YouTube's (GOOGC) Robert Kyncl and Baidu COO (BIDU) Qi Lu. Talks and exhibitions will be on artificial intelligence, augmented reality, 4K TVs, robots and new drones, and these are just part of the buzz.

**FX WORLD**

Friday’s NFP has missed big time and our pairs reacted accordingly, or in cases not so subsequently. We are going to have an interesting week, with FED rate hike clues.

The **EURUSD** had a nice run on the NFP report but pulled back to 1.20, which seems to be the support at this point. The pair is still “fighting” 1.21 as it froze the market a bit, if we break it, 1.23 or even 1.25 is doable.

The **GBPUSD** also rallied and turned to the downside. Above 1.365 would mean that we closed a massive gap below and could offer a buy and hold market. Until then just buy the dips, as 1.3333 is the floor.

The **USDJPY** has bounced on Friday, which is interesting since the jobs report numbers missed significantly. This shows that the market is interested to go 115 and beyond. Until we break above, use the dips for entries.

44,2018-01-05,khonsu01,0,"Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Tech Market Could Reach $10 Trillion in 15 Years, Says RBC Analyst","In a report published on January 3, 2018, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves confidently stated that the cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology applications market could increase thirteenfold in 15 years, reaching $10 trillion.

Steves’ report, titled “Crypto Currency &amp; Blockchain Technology: A Decentralized Future — A Potential Multi-Trillion Dollar Opportunity,” has been sent to RBC’s clients. A short summary has been shared on Twitter.

In a video published by CNBC, Steves, who often covers high technology stocks including Nvidia, whose value has been boosted by cryptocurrency mining, defends his bullish expectations on blockchain technology and its applications. According to Steves, cryptocurrencies represent only a part of the $10 trillion pie, the bulk of which is in the rest of the ecosystem existing around blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

“I think what people misunderstand about the cryptocurrency space is that it’s not only a store of value, but it also allows you to secure the internet,” says Steves. Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies will permit creating decentralized versions of value storage services like Dropbox or iCloud. The $10 trillion figure represents one third of the current size of the market for value storage.

Steves argues that blockchain technology will permit creating a “Secure World Computer,” a decentralized world computer without a third-party intermediary, intrinsically more secure because there won’t be centralized servers that can be hacked, and suggests that next-generation killer apps will be built on top of this secure layer.

The smart move for investors, according to Steves, is to get involved with cryptocurrencies directly. As far as traditional stocks are concerned, Steves mentions public companies like AMS and Nvidia, whose chips power cryptocurrency mining hardware, and the private companies that make ASIC chips for bitcoin mining. At the same time, Steves warns that cloud service providers are likely to be the most impacted from blockchain technology, with negative results if they don’t manage to adapt.

According to Steves, the value of the blockchain technology market is also growing due to international remittances — the sending of payments overseas is currently estimated at half a trillion dollars per year — “fat protocol” layers that increase in value as the applications grow, and throughput scaling efforts, such as the Lightning Network, which “appear on track to deliver scaling that accommodates higher transactions/second, ultimately driving higher utility and network value.”

While warning that the cryptocurrency space has many risks, Steves argues that the opportunity appears vast, with constant technology updates, and a multi-trillion dollar market will likely emerge.

In a recent, related article published by the RBC, Frédérique Carrier, managing director and head of investment strategy for RBC Wealth Management in the British Isles, argued that, while cryptocurrencies are unlikely to replace traditional money, blockchain technology could have wide-ranging implications in many industries and for investors in the medium-to-long term.

The potential of blockchain technology “makes it a technology well worth watching closely, which we intend to do,” notes Carrier, adding that RBC is experimenting with blockchain technology in its personal, commercial and capital markets businesses. RBC recently announced the implementation of a blockchain-based shadow ledger for cross-border payments between the U.S. and Canada.

Example of a ""typical"" increase in a cryptocurrency's price: https://i.imgur.com/qKhONNk.png

Almost every time a cryptocurrency's price rapidly increases, it falls gradually afterwards, proportional to the amount of time the rise lasted. On the other hand, stock prices tend to be more stable after news of a positive event. I think this can be attributed to 2 primary factors:

1. Cryptocurrencies do not have a good way to value them. Thus, the price is based on opinions and sentiments. When people buy a coin in reaction to a positive event, they don't know when they should stop buying. They'll keep buying until it becomes overvalued. Then, when the hype for the positive event cools down, there's not enough demand to sustain the high prices. However, since prices are sticky-down, they slowly fall back to equilibrium.

2. You can't short cryptocurrencies, at least not altcoins. If people short cryptocurrencies once they think it's overpriced, there will be more downward pressure on the price. Currently, the only downward pressure comes from people who have owned the coin before news of the positive event and people who bought the coin early in response to the positive event. There's a much larger group of people who could apply downward pressure: people who don't buy the coin because they think it's overvalued, so they want to short it, but they can't.

What's your opinion on this? Are there other important factors as to why stock prices tend to be more stable after rising in price? In my opinion, less important factors include more liquidity in stock markets and more bots trading in stock markets."

62,2018-02-17,financeadvicethrwawy,60,I have 100k all in one US stock. How should I diversify this to ensure a financially stable future?,"Hello everybody! Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll start with some background information:

I am 21 years old and in my fourth year of university. I study international business. When I was born, my grandfather invested in a US stock (biopharma) for me that split many times and ended up as a large sum of cash. It has paid for my college thus far and will leave me in the green after graduation. I have no debt. With only one semester left, I'll probably have somewhere near $90k when I graduate. I also have about $10k in cryptocurrency. My stock pays about a 3% dividend. I have no credit. I am also a dual citizen of USA and Switzerland with the opportunity to invest easily in international markets.

However, as I am currently an unemployed student, I depend on these funds for my daily living expenses such as rent, insurance, and food. At this rate, without any income, these funds will all be gone within a few more years of living off of them. Considering how high the market is, I'm a bit worried about a market crash/correction, especially because all of my eggs are in one basket. This leads to my questions for y'all.

How should I diversify these funds so that they continue to grow and prosper throughout my life? What actions should I take to set up a successful financial future with my current financial position? What would be the best way to utilize these funds in creating passive income streams?

I've been researching other stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds, but have been unable to come to a consensus on my own. Some specific options I've looked into are ARKW, AMZN, GOOG, TSLA, FB, QQQ, and NVDA, as well as other forms of investment such as real estate and gold. I'm very interested in industries such as tech, renewable energy, marijuana, blockchain, and finance.

I know you all are finance gurus, and I could really use your help in planning for a secure, successful financial future. Any guidance and advice is much appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!"

Shares in the Paris-based company have soared more than 60 percent since it gave further details of its crypto push on Feb. 8, after first mentioning some of the plans in December. Atari is taking a stake in a company that’s building a blockchain-based digital entertainment platform and, as part of that agreement, it will create its own digital currency called Atari Token. The company is also expanding its online casino-gaming partnership with Pariplay Ltd. to allow gambling with digital currencies.

“Blockchain technology is poised to take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize, the current economic ecosystem, especially in the areas of the video game industry and online transactions,” Atari Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederic Chesnais said in the statement. “Our aim is to take strategic positions with a limited cash risk, in order to best create value with the assets and the Atari brand.”

Atari isn’t the only stock that has benefited from links with cryptocurrencies. Shares of Eastman Kodak Co. jumped 245 percent in two days after it said last month it’s working with a company that promotes paparazzi photos to offer a blockchain-based service for paying photographers. And, in perhaps the most bizarre of such moves, the unprofitable iced-tea company formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Corp. gained 183 percent in a day after re-branding as Long Blockchain Corp. in December.

This sub should have more investing directed activities. What should we include that isn't us talking about Vanguard 24/7?","I'm a scrub when it comes to this whole investing thing. I know I am but I go here a good amount to learn how to be a better investor. I had my hopes up about the reading group one user was going to do with The Intelligent Investor and it didn't come to fruition. Which is sad because the minds on this sub are incredible but a lot of the threads that come up here are littered with answers related to ""Vanguard index funds"", ""ETFs"", and I'm so fucking happy we're not seeing a lot of cryptocurrency posts anymore but that was a big one also. 

Investing, as far as my schmuck mind has gathered, is way more than just dropping money in index funds and ETFs and funds of various other goals. It, much to the chagrin of a lot of the people who do respond with the aforementioned responses such as ""Vanguard"", ETF, etc., includes picking individual stocks. Rallying around passive investing is good, yes, but let's be real for a good minute here: Are we going to listen? If anything some of you readers might be holding blue-chip stocks. Which is fine, but I want to know WHY you own them and have the ensuing discussion revolved around investing methods. So we can all learn why you picked this, hopefully not just because it's a blue-chip stock, but because there's a concise valuation you found within reading about the company that led you to believe your money would be best suited going to that company.

Let's create discussion around various methods of investing, picking out current and past investors and analyzing their methods, reading groups. I know I'm only getting started with this investing journey but my god its my money and I want to take it more fucking seriously than ""Vanguard"", ""ETFs"", ""buy and hold"", ""bitcoin"", and simplistic answers.

68,2018-02-12,Maxkim12,3,22 year old looking for the smartest investing route,"Hey guys, new to this sub. I'm 22, graduating college in a year, and then probably off to grad school. Between a small online business that I run, a part time job, and a well timed investment into cryptocurrency, I have a few thousand dollars available to invest.

What are my best options? I have no debt, so I'm good in that department. I'm willing to invest into something long term, but I would like to retain the ability to take out at least part of the investment, since it's possible I'll need it to help pay for grad school.

Things I've looked into:

-Starting a Roth IRA. If I do this, I would then need to also decide which specific investments to invest in once the money's in the account. The tax free earnings is pretty solid though.

-Mutual funds/Index funds/Bonds etc. Basically all the standard investments, just I would do it privately instead of first putting my money into a Roth IRA. The way I see it, there are pros and cons to both, but if anyone has a strong opinion about either feel free to share it.

-Something in Real Estate I don't really have enough to straight up buy a property, so it would probably have to be through a REIT or something similar. Does anyone have experience with this?

-P2P money lending Another lesser known investing path I've found. Apparently average returns is around 7%/year, which is pretty solid.

-buy Gold/Silver more long term, but I've heard alot of smart people are for this, especially Silver.

What are your thoughts? If I missed anything, feel free to suggest it."
69,2018-02-10,DogfaceDino,12,"Kerrisdale Capital publishes blistering report on Kodak and KODAKCoin, their crypto currency and media rights licensing solution","From the introduction:

&gt; We are short shares of Eastman Kodak Company (“Kodak”, NYSE: KODK), a 138-year old commercial printing and imaging company whose stock has more than doubled since announcing a blockchain and cryptocurrency licensing partnership.

&gt;Fittingly for a long-time provider of motion picture film products, Kodak’s sudden rise resembles something out of the movies. A dying relic of American manufacturing licenses its brand to a blockchain project and immediately creates over $300m of value. Along the way Kodak board members conveniently grant themselves shares the day before the announcement, a stock promoter with a checkered past is engaged for PR, and a group of German copyright trolls reinvent themselves as blockchain-enabled image platform managers.

&gt;Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are exciting technologies with the potential to disrupt many industries; their use in media rights licensing by KODAKOne will not be one of them. The use of blockchain in operating an image copyright platform accomplishes nothing. KODAKOne intends to utilize smart contracts and a crypto-asset to solve the problem of copyright infringement, but the business idea is flat-out silly. Cryptographically hashing an image into a blockchain doesn’t prove the provenance of intellectual property, a blockchain does not reduce the resources necessary for copyright enforcement, no photographer would rather be paid in KODAKCoins over real money, etc. KODAKOne is little more than a moribund company’s hollow attempt to chase the ICO craze. It’s a PR stunt – a distraction that will pass when the company reports earnings and reminds investors of its distressed financial position.

&gt;Unsurprisingly for such a nonsensical business concept, the team behind KODAKCoin has zero credibility. The chairman and founder of a key firm behind the ICO is a stock promoter who was previously banned from a Canadian stock exchange. KODAKOne’s executive team is unknown within the blockchain developer community. KODAKCoin is not a serious attempt to apply new technology to a real problem – it’s a last-ditch stock promotion gambit for a company hurtling towards bankruptcy.

&gt;Kodak faces significant debt maturities, tightening liquidity, and restrictive debt covenants while financials are in free fall. The company is a sub-scale player in a highly competitive, secularly declining industry. Management has repeatedly failed to stem negative free cash flow and botched long promised asset sales. The situation is grim and these same set of circumstances bankrupted the company 6 years ago. Kodak doesn’t have the luxury of hoping startup blockchain projects succeed – it’s staring at the possibility of default and a debt restructuring in the next 12-18 months. Potential ICO proceeds and royalty payments from KODAKOne do not change the high probability of these events. Rather than dreaming of a “new economy” for photographers, shareholders should be concerned about an eventual wipe-out. We view the equity as worthless, implying downside of -100%.

70,2018-02-08,PowerDubs,2,"1+1+1=$$$? Lets discuss Atari who is emerging involvement with gaming, gambling, blockchain crypto, AMD...","I own stock in Atari, therefore I try to follow their projects.

They have offices in the U.S. but are based out of France, so most of the chatter online I have to run through Google translate.

I have noticed a trend in their projects which ties together nicely- speculative at this point yes, but the entire market is speculative really (invest in a company hoping they will profit, grow, expand, etc).

So here is what I have so far- lets discuss possibilities.

#1- Atari is already involved in real money gambling, both online and in casinos.  One of their partners is Pariplay.  Reference- http://www.pariplayltd.com/legend-lives-pariplay-atari-launch-atari-pong-online-slot/  ""Pong is the latest video arcade classic from Atari® to be honoured with an action-packed online slot, featuring non-stop excitement and plenty of big win potential. Pariplay’s previous Atari®-branded releases include Asteroids®, Star Raiders® and Black Widow®.""

#2- Pariplay just signed a deal with Foxwoods casino.  Reference- https://www.reviewed-casinos.com/news/pariplay-foxwoods-igaming-platform-tie/  ""Gaming tech firm Pariplay has partnered Foxwoods Resort Casino in what it considers a landmark technology agreement.
... enabling guests at North America's largest resort casino to enjoy digital gaming on-property

... provide guests access to a myriad of digital games, including branded titles Atari Pong, X-O Manowar and Atari Asteroids via a Foxwoods-branded mobile application and web portal.



#3- Atari just released this- (again google translated)

""Paris, France - February 8, 2018. The Atari Group announces two major development projects in the field of blockchains and crypto-currencies, with a shareholding in a crypto-platform and the creation of a dedicated Token (""Atari Token""), and on the other hand the upcoming launch of casino platforms offering crypto-currency game options.

Acquisition of a stake in Infinity Networks Ltd (Gibraltar) and creation of Atari Token
Atari took a 15% stake, with a 17.5% stake in Infinity Networks, Ltd. (Gibraltar). This investment, made without cash disbursement by Atari, demonstrates the appeal of the Atari brand. Infinity Networks, Ltd. (Gibraltar), a company founded by a team of veteran Entertainment and Finance industry veterans and led by Ron Dimant and Daniel Doll-Steinberg, has an advisory board that brings together leading figures from foreground in the field of blockchains. The company is developing a decentralized platform giving access to any form of digital entertainment, ie a very wide offer ranging from video games to movies and music. This platform, under development, will work using cryptocurrency, the Atari Token. In exchange for these equity interests, earnings and future royalties, Atari has granted Infinity Networks, Ltd. (Gibraltar) a long-term license to use the Atari brand.

""Blockchains technology is poised to take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize, the current economic ecosystem, especially in the areas of the video game industry and online transactions,"" he said. Frédéric Chesnais, CEO of Atari, SA. ""Given our technological strengths with the development studios, and the global reputation of the Atari brand, we have the opportunity to position ourselves attractively in this sector. Our objective is to take strategic positions with a limited cash risk, in order to optimize the assets and the Atari brand "".

The second project in progress is the strengthening of the partnership with Pariplay, Ltd in the launch in 2018 of casino platforms allowing players to bet either in real money or with most crypto-currencies currently outstanding. . These casino sites will offer many Atari games. To broaden the appeal of these new casinos, and once the Atari Token available, Atari has the project to launch Pong Token, a second Token dedicated to crypto-casinos and usable on these gaming sites.

#5-  We all know the widespread knowledge that Atari &amp; AMD are partnered on the upcoming Atari home gaming console- confirmed by AMD to be using a Ryzen chip.

SOO...again this is all speculation by me, but this console *could* not only be used for normal games, but possibly be involved with the Atari token both in transactions, gaming, mining, and even gambling.

Lots to chew on.  Lots that would need to fall into place.  Lots of chances of failures.  But if it all ties together like it appears it could do...they just may be consolidating what at initial glance would be diversified projects.

Thoughts? "

* 24hr Volume Ubit: 145million
* 24hr Volume Binance: 129million

This is HUGE. I imagine we will continue to see Ubit and shortly Bitthumb to have the largest volume of ICX trading. South Korea is notoriously strict with crypto, making it really hard for citizens to use any other exchanges. The fact that ICX is now listed on these exchanges will solidify ICX as the number one traded crypto in South Korea in the very near future. After all, it is a South Korean backed cryptocurrency. For these reasons, I think ICX will outperform most cryptos by Q3 this year.

Source: I took this from this FB group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/116014865776792/?ref=bookmarks

Note: A lot of them are backing ICX so be aware that there is some bias. But they have made some really good calls before.

submitted just now by joebloggs3562

I want to experiment with various portfolio mechanisms for governing a cryptocurrency portfolio.

This will be in preparation for when everything bullish again. I'll also be aiming to build a position on BTC and other cryptos if we fall to around $3.5.

I'd like to experiment with two types of portfolio's: 1. SAA (strategic asset allocation) 2. TAA (tactical asset allocation)

With SAA it would essentially aim to optermise buy and hold by buying everything and then rebalancing based on some threshold, say if coin A exceeds 5% of the original allocation sell and then buy anything that's under 5% of the original allocation. (this is just one mech for SAA I have others, for example comparing a coins performance to the overall performance of the markets)

TAA would be more experimental. What I'm thinking is using some quant strat, let's say mean reversion for the sake of this example. Here the portfolio determines the allocation and re balances based around the output of the signal.
Does any one know any good MOOCs that could help me make these? I have a background in engineering not finance. Financial engineering, alpha development, portfolio management etc would be relevant topics I need to refresh my memory on the maths too."

84,2018-03-05,Noqt,314,"Long $NVDA, involvement in AI will bring success for them long term","$NVDA is a gaming company. It has been since its inception. Most recently, Nvidia has been big into Artificial intelligence. Most headlines reference something to do with AI. I think this transition from gaming to AI is important for Nvidia's growth in the next decade. My price target for them is a 40% upside, $329. Is that even possible given how much it's grown this past year? I think so. 


[Here is the google drive with the model, paper, and open position proof, updated whenever I update them](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h2cTeiNRP07K8-2Wn4lYyQtbB_go2HGB?usp=sharing)


I'm just going to go over some catalysts and some risks:


Catalysts


* New GeForce series using the new Volta architecture, Series 20. Announcement will be big, should be in March 2018. The already released GPUs with Volta have been successful, I expect that trend to continue.


* Cryptocurrency becoming more popular. Crypto isn't going away, so I'd assume it to be a catalyst. I don't like to pay attention to it. 


* Two years until we are seeing some of Nvidia's big autonmous vehicles come to life. Both the driving platform they are developing in china with ZF and Baidu, and the Volkswagen VW AI-infused Bus are expected to be actualized in 2020. If we see some success in the execution of these projects, I'd consider it a catalyst. I'm confident their execution will be successful given the success they've already demonstrated in AI with their datacenter revenue.


* Gaming industry big news (PC). Every year there is more gamers, every year gamers get better jobs, every year there are more games. GPUs are an integral part to gaming, so these revenues will grow with the gaming market.


Risks:


* Semiconductor industry decline. The semiconductor industry is interesting because a decline in one can cause they others to underperform. This is an entire topic on its own.


* AMD/new GPU designer taking market share from Nvidia. Unlikely, but Nvidia's dominance in the GPU market is why I am so bullish. I want to invest in the leader of AI deep learning training hardware and graphics processing, not the second best.


* Jensen Huang, the CEO, losing his ability to lead the company. Nvidia has has successfully positioned themselves to be a part of the future of AI, which I think is accredited to Huang's execution. This is a positive, he's invested in the company. The downside to this is that he is very important and anything that hurts his ability to lead would hurt Nvidia.


* New GeForce 20 series being not much of an upgrade from series 10, possibility but I think unlikely. Unlikely because their Titan V uses 12nm technology.


Price Target:


* I used a DCF model to arrive at the price target of $329, using a 7% discount rate and 1% perpetual growth rate. In the model I assume 39% revenue growth in Nvidia's 2019 fiscal year, 32% in 2020, and 28% in 2021. I based this off their plans in autonomous driving, and their new GeForce series to be released with Volta architecture. 


What I think:


I think Nvidia successfully integrating its hardware into so many big company's is a huge success for their long term goals. Nvidia hardware is being utilized in Tesla's electic car's autopilot 2.0, and used by Google and Amazon Web Services datacenters. Nvidia is so dominant that no one can take these positions unless the company wants to build their own chips, which would be billions of dollars in R&amp;D. Nvidia is supplying hardware for these big companies and there is no one to compete.


TLDR: NVIDIA is investing into AI. Nvidia's Drive PX 2 operates Tesla's autopilot 2.0 system, Nvidia's new Tesla GPUs have grown datacenter revenue by 133% this last year, and their focus on the narrow AI to bring autonomous vehicles on the road is proving to be worth it. $329, long equity. 


Why am I doing this?


Well I don't think I am perfect and I think I missed A LOT, so I want some critisism to get as close to perfection as I can. Read the paper and look at the model.

We know it's set to drastically disrupt industries like banking and energy in the next 5-10 years, but many of the companies currently developing these innovations are start-ups or small private companies. 

How does the average investor (not a finance professional or HNI individual) get exposure to this space when publicly-traded companies solely focused on blockchain don't exist yet? Am I limited to big blue chips like IBM, Microsoft and Barclays who are integrating and funding the technology, and ETFs made up the same companies (but selling at a premium)? Or are there other less-obvious opportunities out there? "

87,2018-04-28,ToothFairyTea,0,Risk Managment. Minimize your risk to maximize your ROI. Diversifying outside of Cryptocurrencies.,"**Diversifying Outside of CryptoCurrencies**

Cryptocurrency has been the best investment (or gamble) one could have done in the past 5 years.

But, we have to be careful and learn from history.  **Past performance is NOT indicative of future results**. It's easy to get caught up in the thrill, believing that it can only keep going up and up. Only to realize 2 or 3 years later that you are right back to your initial investment or even lower. 

I know you've all heard this but here it is once again; 2000 Dot Com Boom and Bust. Companies had crazy valuation without ever selling a thing. Just having a cool name like **""pets.com"" was enough for people to dump in over $300M dollars into it.** If that doesn't **remind you of the** **current ICO situation** than it might not be a stretch to say this is the first time you've ever really invested. 

I know you've probably heard this a million time but **diversification is key.** I've spoken with a lot of investors with all sorts of backgrounds, some successful, some not so much. But the **key similarity that all the top investors I know share is diversification.** These individuals have made millions investing this way and it is something everyone should take note of

If you have nothing to lose, crypto is probably your best bet. BUT if you are heavily invested in crypto with almost no real life assets...then maybe it's time to think of purchasing something like stocks, bonds, lands, gold or whatever is more stable over the long term.

Here is an idea that I would to everyone regardless of their financial situation. **Treat cryptocurrencies as the ""high risk"" portion of your total portfolio.** For instance, 20% of your total portfolio would be in crypto while the remaining 80% would be spread out over blue chips, bonds, and dividends. 

**Risk Management**
I am a strong believer that by **minimizing your risk you will maximize your potential.** In a market that is incredibly risky and unpredictable, the ones who come out on top will be those who don't get burned. With crypto playing it safe still gives the opportunity for incredible ROIs. I'll be posting Apollo Investments quarterly picks when they get released. I expect their picks to follow a similar trend of **minimizing risk to maximize potential.**

First time posting here but I have a slight obsession with saving money and my savings account now is one paycheck away from 15,000. I get about 11 cents of interest a month.

I invested in cryptocurrency a little while back, so I have some idea of how investing works. But I pulled out of that awhile ago and just have all my money in a bank. I'm afraid to part with my money though \- I like the certainty of its value sitting in a secure place, but I know I could make more money investing \(and lose it all too!\) Before I even thought investing was an option for me, I always had this goal of having 10,000 grand on hand at all times in savings but as my money grows I now know it's smarter to do more with it.

Can anyone give me some tips and encouragement to withdraw this money and invest it? What kind of companies should I invest in? I know the general rule is to invest in companies you see a good future for, but isn't that almost every major company right now? Like Apple, Amazon, Nvda, Tesla, etc? Also, what is a good amount to actually keep in a savings account?

112,2018-05-18,NikolaosKost,4,China Issued Cryptocurrency Rating Index: Ethereum First,"On May 17, the first monthly cryptocurrency rating index that evaluates 28 virtual currencies and Blockchains was launched by the CCID. The index has been developed based on three criteria: technology, application, and innovation.

Ethereum scores were very high in all three categories: 80.3 in technology, 23.7 in applicability and 25.4 in creativity. The total score obtained by Ethereum was 129.4 points. In the second\-place comes Steem with 115.9 points and then Lisk scoring 104.89 points.

Bitcoin coin ranks 13th scoring 88.1 points, the same as Verge.

The Twitter account cnLedger uploaded a table that shows the ranking cited by ethereumworldnews.com:

During the last year, China took several measures to con troll cryptocurrencies and banned Initial Coin Offerings \(ICOs\). Virtual currency trading activities are also banned.

Notably, China’s intention to create a national cryptocurrency was a pioneer. Russia, Venezuela, and Iran followed the same way.

The underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, Blockchain, can be applied to many other industries like finance, healthcare, supply chain, and others. And it is known that China is one of the leading countries regarding Blockchain tech.

In 2017, according to Reuters, China registered more than half of the world’s Blockchain related patent applications. This trend seems to be continued in 2018. That is the obvious reason behind the government’s intention to understand how cryptocurrencies work, how they are being developed and what they have to offer.

Ethereum has been selected as the network with the second\-highest score in technology, the best score in the application and a very good score in innovation. Notably, the market capitalization of the coin is unrelated to the index. Litecoin, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash do not have a good ranking. They were 21st, 17th, and 25th respectively. EOS is not present in the report.

115,2018-05-16,feifeifeig,0,Crypto portfolio app reviews(Blockfolio VS Coinbox VS Delat),"## Well, a few friends of mine had a conversation about current crypto portfolio apps in the market, it got me thinking about how there are plenty of alternatives and it can be a little bit confusing to those new participants.Besides, it seems there are a few main portfolio trackers and it also hard to pick a nice one to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. So I've asked some people about what app do they currently use for crypto portfolio management on reddit (thanks guys) and here's what I found. PS: I found a new app just came out last month, it's not bad actually ,and I really really liked the allocation feature! I wanted to share it with with you guy as well: )

Blockfolio

Pros:

Blockfolio was the first crypto app I downloaded, unlike the most of free apps in market, the interface of Blockfolio is not congested with aggressive advertisements at all, and it has no ads, very clean interface.

I'm not a day trader, but still I liked the price notification a lot.I would know what is happening to my portfolios at all times by setting alerts at certain dollar amount.

The charts are really insightful on Blockfolio, and it also very easy to understand, totally better than Delta at this point.

Cons:

I was having some server issues with Blockfolio is that COSS exchange not working on its app, and I couldn't see my overall profits...they might have improved it, I am not sure.

Another issue is that it didn't alert me a couple of times, which made me lose out on some important events.Obviously, this feature is not very optimal.

All portfolio information on Blockfolio must be inputed manually, it is very annoying to those people who have a number of holdings which include me.

Trading pairs can be limited sometimes, I saw people complained about this before,and it occurred to me as well.for example, some coins only show BTC &amp; fiat pairs.

no need to add a link, I'm pretty sure you can find it easily

Coinbox

It is a new crypto portfolio app I found on YouTube, obviously it's still on its early stage/version, but I liked it coz it is doing great as a new app. Pros:

Just like I mentioned above, Coinbox got a pie area that shows you allocations of your portfolios which is pretty cool. It tells you the percentage of each investment on different coins.

It also got a location pie chart which present you percentage of you portfolios on each exchange, once you put everything together, it will up to date.

Just like what's Delta doing, with Coinbox you could actually import the APIs of the exchanges that you trade with, and this app is supposed to actually to automatically keep track of the coins that you are trading.

Coinbox supports multiple coins at no cost, yes, it is completely free! as a new app so far so good.

You can see what happened to your portfolio in the last 24 hours, it is nice to see how much you lost/gained in one day.

It has a very simple design and easy navigation with one click to different tools and areas\(3 tabs only\)

Nice and clean interface, I think it is available on both Google play and Apple store.

Cons:

Only two Language options: English and Chinese, it might be enough, but it is no harm to add a couple of more.

It definitely needs to add more exchanges, I think the team has been working on it according to the coinbox introduction video I watched.

Some details need to be improved, but overall it is pretty cool, I sent an email to Coinbox team to give them my reviews, I would appreciate their openness.

Delta

Pros

Delta is amazing I gotta say, I switched over from Blockfolio to Delta a couple months ago, and I know a lot of people do that too!Firstly, Delta got nice\-designed and friendly interface, better than any of the apps for me.

Delta also offers importing transactions automatically from exchanges which is great for any traders. It also has a watchlist which means you can add more portfolios and have a separated list.

Delta has supported a large range of coins\(With2000\+\), I believe that not everyone sticks to top 50 coins\(my friends are not\), so Delta might help more investor to be adventurous.

It is not only available on Google play and Apple store, but also available on desktop!

Cons

Delta is really good app in the market, but it is not completely free though.

Again, the features on free version are limited, I have to pay it a monthly fee for more.

The interface style is might not for anyone, a friend of mine like Blockfolio&amp;BitUniverse more.

There are plenty of crypto app options out there, it totally depends on your needs. These reviews is just a starting point to help you on your way to finding the right one for you. For me, I would have Delta and Coinbox on my phone, Delta is good enough obviously, but I would also like to see a new app grow. These opinions are my own and I'd like to hear if you agree/disagree. Or your views on other apps."

117,2018-05-16,Derivatives99,1,How MARKET Protocol differs from traditional exchanges and has the potential to disrupt the quadrillion dollar derivatives market.,"Derivatives represent the largest store of value in the world, with some estimates suggesting the combined value of all derivatives surpasses US$1 quadrillion.

The derivatives market encapsulates a number of different types of trades including over-the-counter and exchange futures, options, forwards, and swaps. The largest derivatives exchange is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), whose volume of contracts executed lies in the billions per year.

Despite the massive size and popularity of derivatives, the nature of existing exchanges and market capabilities incite a number of inefficiencies and shortcomings. The issues faced by legacy exchanges can be addressed and solved by a decentralized alternative like MARKET Protocol.

Built on the Ethereum blockchain, MARKET Protocol ditches a centralized exchange in favor of an ecosystem of dApps and smart contracts, in which the public has full control to view and execute actions on the protocol. This brings full transparency to an otherwise opaque industry. Every single derivative, ongoing or closed, will be viewable forever on the public Ethereum blockchain. This eliminates any fear of the possibility that what is shown https://www.marketprotocol.io/ on the frontend does not match the backend.

This blockchain-based approach also eliminates the role of middlemen and trusted third parties. Derivatives exchanges typically rely on clearing firms to confirm trades and handle customer funds. Sufficient measures are not in place to ensure that the firm operates correctly. This dilemma was made very clear in 2011, when clearing firm MF Global announced a US$1.2 billion shortfall.

When MF Global declared bankruptcy, over 33,000 traders were locked out of trustee controlled funds.

Along with the removal of middlemen, MARKET’s decentralized approach removes inefficiencies or inequities perpetuated by the exchange itself through inclusivity to all traders. Centralized exchanges greatly limit the populations eligible to trade due to outward regulations and inward restrictions.

Not only must traders on these markets match certain levels of verification and accreditation, they still often require a broker to place trades for them. Anyone in the world can communicate with the Ethereum blockchain, which similarly means that anyone can interact with MARKET Protocol.

In addition to the inclusivity presented, this decentralized approach also greatly empowers traders in the freedom to trade exactly what and how they wish to trade. Entities like CME and CBOE choose only to list commodities believed to earn volume-listing based on values such as the open interest and market activity of the commodity.

MARKET Protocol, on the other hand, is universal. Traders have the full capacity to open contracts in relation to any commodity. Whether a niche locality or global output, traders maintain the unwavering right to trade whatever they believe to be the most profitable derivative.

MARKET Protocol also offers support for a wide variety of currencies to be used as collateral. This includes the more than 600 tokens listed on Coinmarketcaps that use the Etherum network. This additionally includes the asset-backed tokens provided by Digix, such as the DGX stablecoin, which is backed by gold.

Derivatives exchanges, in comparison, typically only accept USD as collateral. Even in the case of cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, the currencies accepted as collateral remain very limited. For example, the leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange, BitMEX, only accepts Bitcoin as collateral.

MARKET Protocol also insures against forced liquidations. Every order executed specifies dates and values for closing the given contract. As there is no fluctuating margin component, forced liquidations do not take place whatsoever. This protects traders on both ends of a commodity from squeezes, where prices can artificially explode upwards or downwards when forced liquidations occur.

In extreme circumstances, the outcome of such events can carry heavy implications. For example, a large sale of Ethereum on GDAX in June of 2017 triggered a short squeeze where long futures were force liquidated, leading to more and more ETH sales and even more forced liquidations. Ultimately, ETH experienced a flash crash, dipping momentarily to US$0.10 as the entire buy book was eliminated.

During times of huge volatility in Bitcoin, BitMEX traders often find themselves unable to place and close contracts. In some instances, individuals are unable to access the site entirely, simply due to the hardware behind the exchange failing to keep up with request volume. As MARKET is built directly upon the blockchain, all contracts created and matched are verified and fulfilled by the Ethereum network. There is no risk that open operations cannot be performed and new trades cannot be placed.

Lastly, derivatives exchanges operate similar to a network of digital IOUs. That is, when trades take place, values behind the trade — both the collateral and the commodity, do not necessarily trade hands. As mentioned earlier, such a system can lead to dire consequences, such as insolvency. On the MARKET Protocol, when contracts open, funds are transferred from the traders to the smart contract itself, where funds are frozen in escrow on the blockchain. At the close of the contract, the contents of the trade are transferred to their respective owners.

Given all these differences, there is certainly a case to be made that decentralized derivatives exchanges, pioneered by MARKET Protocol, represent a worthwhile system of trading that has the potential to disrupt the quadrillion dollar derivatives market. MARKET Protocol represents an exciting and empowering opportunity to trade with more freedom and ownership than has ever been possible, especially for traders that have been victim to the faults of legacy exchanges.

I have some experience in purchasing crypto coins (bitcoin, etherum, ripple, litecoin) and want to pass that experience onto you guys.

If anyone wants help with getting into this area of investment then don’t be afraid to comment on here or send me a message.

120,2018-05-13,haggenballs,7,Got sick of cryptocurrency price speculation. Made an easy way to index the entire asset cryptocurrency asset class.," Hey guys. 

I’ve been pretty frustrated with the speculation and baseless price predictions in the cryptocurrency market. So I took the boring, old\-school concept of indexing and applied it to cryptocurrencies. 

The index tracks the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization using a weighted\-cap indexing methodology. Each coin cannot go over 10&amp;#37; of the entire portfolio. The excess is redistributed to any of the top 20 coins under 10&amp;#37;  by weighted market capitalization until the entire sum of the portfolio adds to to 100&amp;#37;. 

The top 20 coins makes up \~87&amp;#37; of the cryptocurrency market. For comparison the S&amp;P 500 represents \~75&amp;#37; of the US stock market.

At first I was calculating and executing this strategy by hand. But monthly rebalancing took me forever to do and was extremely tedious. So, I made an algorithm to do it instead. It uses the Binance exchange API to facilitate these trades. 

Last month, I launched a hosted version that anybody can use. It’s called [HodlBot](https://www.hodlbot.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=investing-indexing). I’ve only shared it with a few cryptocurrencies communities  and [/r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/8dvy93/i_made_a_algo_bot_that_indexes_into_the_top_20/) thus far. But I thought it may interest some of you here that are considering making cryptocurrency a small part of your overall investment portfolio. 

I’ve backtested the index against 3 years of historical data and talk about it [here](https://medium.com/@AnthonytXie/hodlbot-cryptocurrency-investing-on-autopilot-dce2e4c9a7f7).  *Take the backtest data with a grain of salt. The crypto market has been on fire in the last 3 years.*

In the one and a half months of live trading, the indexing strategy was up 99&amp;#37;. Performance details and transaction logs [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/8h85kp/2x_from_algorithmically_indexing_top_20/). 

If you’re thinking about checking it out, I just want to pass a long one important disclaimer:

HodlBot is a long\-term, passive, low\-cost, indexing strategy. HodlBot does not actively trade, it does not try to beat the market. HodlBot only tries to capture the risk &amp; performance of the market as a whole, and lower your alpha and your unsystematic risk. 

I’ve had to explain this again and again over in the cryptocurrency subs, but I think you guys should understand this a lot better since most of you should be pretty familiar with indexing. 

The cryptocurrency market is really volatile as a whole. So for an average investor, I don’t recommend putting more money than you would normally allocate to high\-risk assets. But if you believe in the tech \(or just want to hedge your bets\), then indexing is a great way to bet on the market as a whole. It’ll save you the headache from trying to pick out the winners. 

Thanks you guys for reading. I’d love it if you guys could check it out and let me know what you think. 

More details about the indexing methodology are available [here](https://hackernoon.com/hodlbot-cryptocurrency-investing-on-autopilot-dce2e4c9a7f7). "

123,2018-05-11,QuantalyticsResearch,3,Buy the weakness in NVDA,"Are investors selling Nvidia due to a 65% forecasted slowdown in cryptocurrency-linked revenue? 

Cryptocurrency related sales were reported to be just under USD$300mm which made up roughly 9% of total revenue. OEM sales increased 115% and 148% Q/Q &amp; Y/Y respectively. OEM sales for this quarter came in at 12% of total revenue vs historical averages under 10%. It is clear this quarter was an outlier, yet revenue is expected to be USD$3.1bn, a 39% increase Y/Y for 2Q2019, even with a 65% drop in cryptocurrency related sales. This would imply that other core businesses like its Datacenter &amp; Automotive sector may continue accelerating. Additionally, Nvidia’s gaming and professional visualization, where it receives 60% of its revenues, growth will likely pick up to meet the company’s revenue target. Perhaps it makes sense to buy the weakness off the crypto related fears?

Taken from the recent [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/worlds-second-most-valuable-cryptocurrency-under-regulatory-scrutiny-1525167000): Gary Gensler, a former CFTC chairman, said in a speech last week that “there is a strong case that one or both of ETH and \[Ripple’s\] XRP are noncompliant securities,” using the shorthand for the virtual currencies. 

How is everyone feeling about Monday? I am confident that ETH will **NOT** be considered a security. I don't pretend to be an expert on any of this, but I know people that are close to the situation, whether that being working at a top 25 dApp \(in market cap\), or at Consensys.

128,2018-05-04,Dont_Go_Zero_To_BBC,1,"What is the best historical comparison, theoretically speaking, for Bitcoin's meteoric rise / 'bubble'","In some senses, Bitcoin is unique within the historical perspective. That is to say, cryptocurrency and the blockchain technology is different from anything that existed before. 

But in another sense, Bitcoin is not unique. History is replete with fundamentally new things coming market. Amazon as an exclusively online retailer was new in this sense when it came about. Microsoft as an operating system could be said to have been new in a similar way when it came about. 

Is there a good historical comparison for the meteoric rise of Bitcoin? Not something that was just once fundamentally new, but that has more compelling resonances with Bitcoin than simply being fundamentally new or a first-mover?

One could look at the NASDAQ (with focus on 1998-2002). But can the NASDAQ bubble be compellingly compared to Bitcoin, or are there reasons to believe that if Bitcoin is a bubble it is at least a different *kind* of bubble than that of the NASDAQ? Why or why not? Does NASDAQ being based on stocks which in turn are supported by a possibility of accessing collateral make it uncomparable, or not?

What would you say is the historic example of a bubble that can *best* be likened to Bitcoin?--and why do you think other potential candidates for comparison are less apt?"

## What is a cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency is a digital asset that acts as a medium of exchange. It utilizes strong cryptography to control the creation of new units, secure financial transactions and verify transfer of assets.

Examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, Ripple and many others.

Cryptocurrencies are also known as virtual or digital currencies. They work through distributed ledger technology better known as the blockchain.

141,2018-06-04,TuxedoTurd,7,Books To Learn About The Economy and Investing,"I'm looking to scratch the tip of the iceberg here.  Little background: I have a college degree that's not in business. I own a successful small business that gives me financial independence.  I invest and have some basic understanding about things like ETFs, cryptocurrency, target date retirement funds, and some understanding of the way markets behave \(if there's such a thing as understanding\).  But I'm a beginner in every way.  I saw ""The Big Short"" and became enamored with understanding the housing market and housing crisis of 2008, as well as other stock market crashes. I want to learn much, much more.

So the question is this: How does a person who doesn't want to go back to college full\-time learn about basics of economics and investing? Specifically, my end game is to understand the relationship between the market and various securities \(so yes, understanding everything discussed in The Big Short because my head starts spinning when I learned about bonds, mortgage\-backed securities, collateralized debt, etc\).  I also want to understand the basic workings of economic markets. I want to ""get"" why some stocks rise and fall, how to identify trends \(while they're happening\), how to speak intelligently about emerging markets, the tech sector, understanding commodities, etc.  I want to be able to better understand macroeconomy, especially as it relates to the available securities for trade on the public market as well as foreign currency exchange rates and how that relationship works.

I know I'm asking for what amounts to an advanced degree and asking for advice on topics you can probably NEVER truly master.  I'm just looking for where to start.  I thought about going back for my MBA, but my hunch is that the cost of getting an MBA is only valuable if you plan on using it to get a high paying job. And I have no interest in that.  I looked at doing some free online courses \(places like MIT love showing off their non\-credit courses\) but listening to an hour long recording when I know I could read a couple chapters of a book seems like a waste of time. That leaves popular books on Amazon \(many of which seem very opinion\-based and niche\), or just straight\-up buying a textbook on Micro or Macroeconomics and studying from there.

Lots of options, most of them are probably viable, but I really wanted to see what some smart people such as yourselves may suggest."

Crypto-exchanges are platforms where cryptocurrencies can be exchanged for other digital currencies or traded for fiat currencies. There are thousands of crypto-exchanges in the market today; however, not all of them provide both crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat trades. Many exchanges also face security breaches and low liquidity.

PCEX aims to remedy the drawbacks faced by crypto-exchanges and to provide a comprehensive solution to crypto-traders.

* PCEX is a one-stop trading platform offering both crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat trading.

148,2018-07-21,alwaysshitting,0,Passive investing in crypto.,"Hey Reddit. I've been lurking on [r/CryptoCurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency) and a few other subs for over 6 months now, reading and learning about various cryptocurrency related nuances. In order to expand my knowledge further and give something back to the community, I decided to pen down a few articles. The first one, as the headline suggests, deals with passive investing. Any feedback on, be it the quality of the article, writing style, etc would be appreciated. :-)

Like any other tradable commodity, cryptocurrencies are driven by the laws of supply and demand. Smaller market size and fickle market sentiment makes cryptocurrencies extremely volatile as compared to the other older trading commodities. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency market is stacked with boundless asymmetrical opportunities to take advantage of. With careful investment planning and research, assisted by tools within a broader strategy, the risk can be minimized.

Broadly classified, there are two types of investment strategy, active and passive. Active strategy is when investors have to adjust their positions on a daily basis whereas passive avoids frequent trading and it aims at steady growth in wealth over time.

**What is Passive Investing?**

Traditionally, a buy and hold strategy, passive investing is when investments are made keeping a long time frame in mind. It is not aimed at short term gains (time trading) but rather long term positive results with minimum involvement in trading. These investments avoid trading fees and performance fluctuations, contrast to active trading.

**Key features of Passive Investing are:**

1. Its performance is trackable, hence it is more reliable.
2. Low operating expenses.
3. Good for long term wealth creation.

### Ways to passively invest in crypto:

1. **Staking**

Staking or Proof of Stake ( PoS) is buying the coin and keeping in the wallet for a certain fixed period, like depositing money in a fixed deposit for a fixed period. It is a form of a consensus protocol, where people who own a coin will stake a certain amount on the network, This currency is set aside, and cannot be used in anyway.

When a block is created on the platform, wallets with staked coins are randomly chosen to validate the action. More coins the wallet holds, more chances it has to get chosen and receive the block rewards.

**With earnings upto 100%, staking creates an incentive for holders to invest in a platform and use it on a regular basis.** It is beneficial for both the network and the users, as they can earn back a percentage of their staked assets on a monthly or yearly basis.

**2. Masternodes**

Masternodes are servers or computers on a decentralized network, created for a set amount of collateral capital that is locked in a dedicated wallet. They anonymize the transfers by locking capital in the form of the cryptocurrency they are helping transact. Validation of transactions is much faster for cryptocurrencies supporting masternodes, compared to ones relying only on miners.

***Masternode as passive income source***

Everytime a block is mined, a masternode is randomly selected in a round-robin way to receive the reward for; validating transactions. Once the masternode is in set it can be a steady flow of cash in the form of a reward. In a deconstructed way, with minimal effort you can passively earn.

1. An interest as a reward, for Fixed deposit
2. Additional coins as a reward, for Proof of Stake

**3. Mining**

Mining is a stable way of generating passive income, where your computer does the maximum work. With a one time investment in the equipment cost (fixed assets) to mine currencies, you can keep earning every month. What to look out for is the cost of electricity to run the machines. With mining, your acquisition cost of a cryptocurrency will remain stable. You can always sell it in the market when the price is high to make profit.

**4.** **Crypto Index Funds**

Index is statistical measure of the changes in a portfolio of assets or cryptocurrencies and are designed to track the returns of a market index. The changes in an asset price is proportionate to its index value. Investment in index funds of multiple currencies, or a selected ones forming an index, investors can have portfolio with high return yet lower volatility.

**5.** **Crypto Sector Funds**

Just as index funds track the entire market, sector based funds or baskets as we call them track specific sectors. Investing passively in crypto sector funds can can give you good returns as some sectors will perform better than others. Sectors will also perform differently in different phases of the market — hence the strategy to diversify into Crypto sector based funds."

This may sound like a bullshit, but I am seriously looking for tips on how to invest $100m.

162,2018-07-06,Cryptorich13,0,How do I short the stock market?,"Got removed from r/personal finance and they said  that I should be posting this here.

I'm 28 years old, own a house with two tenants, 27k in student loans. Just got a 6 figure salaried engineering job beginning of year after finally graduating college at age 27. Will likely be at $150k within 2 years. No 401k, no savings, no stocks. My company matches 3 percent to my 6 percent contribution in 401k but I don't like the idea of not being able to touch my money until retirement age so I'd rather invest on my own.

Last year, received $20k from an uncle I didn't know after he passed. Googled highest ROI investment of 2016 and Bitcoin popped up in the search results. So, I dumped it all into crypto and at peak my crypto portfolio was worth $256k. I took 30k in profits when BTC hit $18,300 and have been dollar cost averaging all year with this new job. Sadly, I had some personal issues occur and had to spend $20k on a lawyer. Spent the rest on a 4k TV, PS4, $2000 gaming laptop, new couch, lawn furniture, a few escourts.. ya know the usual stuff.

Currently, my investment is worth $55,000. That's still like $150k in unrealized gains I missed out on. I will never be that stupid again. It was clearly a speculative mania. 

However, having lived a bubble I feel like the nasdaq, Dow, etc are coming close to the ""denial, phase of the market bubble cycle. The stock market can not just go up for forever. I'd like to diversify a little bit out of crypto because I have adequate positions in all the coins I think are most likely to change our lives in 3-5 years and would like to invest in ETF's that short the stock market. I know nothing about stocks but I think we're long overdue  for a crash. Watching Netflix go up the other week reminded me of hodling Bitcoin in November. Absolute delusion. I also think housing in certain areas of the country is completely over-inflated. I saw a shack that was falling apart in Houston on a tiny lot 10 mins from downtown listed at $400,000. Get real. 

Can the average investor short the stock market? Like I said, I'd rather invest in funds that short the market rather than shorting individual stocks. I learned how to short Bitcoin far too late in the game and cryptocurrency is the only investment right now that doesn't look like it's a bubble (as the overall market just went through a -70 percent correction. My biggest loser was -93 percent in 5 months)

I think crypto will solve the problems caused by fractional reserve banking and endless money printing but like I said, I already have all the positions I want. 

Lastly, the government has been giving out massive loans to students pursuing liberal arts degrees that will never provide a salary adequate to be able to pay off the loans. If there's a way to profit off of this, I'd like to look into it too.

You may look at this post and think it's a joke, but it's not. If there's a way for a normal person to profit off the stock market and student loan bubbles, I'll throw a few hundred dollars a week into it. Seems like a better idea at my age than putting money in a 401k that will hardly beat inflation at the height of a stock market bubble. I told myself if I'm not rich off of crypto by age 30 (2 years from now) I'll bite the bullet and start my 401k, because if I haven't made it by age 30, chances are I'll be wageing the rest of my life.

Thanks in advance.

169,2018-08-17,TG_King,0,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink: The Risk Is Worth The Reward","Anyone putting any amount of money into cryptocurrency needs to consider risk vs reward. Is the risk of losing a large percentage of your investment worth the potential reward of massive returns? I will attempt to outline why I believe that buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Chainlink is a risk worth taking.



**Bitcoin**



Whether you like it or not, Bitcoin is here to stay and it is likely to remain the main store of value and transactional currency in the crypto economy. It has enabled a global currency that is not issued or controlled by any centralized authority, allowing you to send value to anyone in any location without any risk of any entity stopping or intercepting the transaction. It is the most secure network in the world due to the robustness of its proof of work consensus mechanism. An attack on the bitcoin network itself is astronomically cost prohibitive and is unlikely to even be attempted in any serious manor.


Layer 2 solutions are being tested on the Bitcoin main net and will soon bring scalability to the network and enable micro transactions. This will make Bitcoin more functional as a currency.


Scarcity is one of the reasons Bitcoin’s price per coin is so high. There will never be more than 21 million coins in existence. If Bitcoin is adopted in any significant capacity as a payment method and/or as a store of value it would not be unreasonable to see it valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.


BTC price at the time of writing - $6400 Current 
Market Cap - $110 Billion



**Ethereum**



Ethereum uses the same blockchain technology as bitcoin but takes it one step further. Ethereum is Turing complete which allows for decentralized applications to run on the network using smart contracts. Smart contracts are simple “if, then” computations that occur autonomously on the network in a decentralized, trust-less manor. This has many real world implications, but I’ll use sports betting as a simple example. Let’s say I want to bet my friend that the Warriors will win the NBA finals again next season. We can put our money into a smart contract that is programmed to pay out the winner of the bet as soon as the event has occurred. If the warriors win, the money will be sent to me by the contract. I do not have to trust that my friend will pay me. We do not have to trust a centralized party to hold our money and execute the pay out. We only have to trust math and math doesn’t tend to lie.


Ethereum also allows developers to create their own tokens on top of the network which has created an entire separate economy of ICOs (initial coin offerings) and digital collectibles (crypto kitties are actually very cool).


Ethereum already has alliances with many major companies and is positioned to be the main smart contracts platform in the cryptocurrency economy. Ether (ETH) is used as gas to power the Ethereum network and will continue to increase in value in tandem with the usage of the network.


Also, Ethereum will soon be switching from proof of work to proof of stake. As soon as that switch occurs ETH holders will be able to stake their ETH in nodes and earn more in return for running the network. Not only does this provide passive income for holders, but it will also lead to a rise in the price of ETH due The the fact that many coins will be locked in nodes thus suppressing the supply.


ETH price at the time of writing - $290 
Market Cap - $27 Billion



**Chainlink**



Let’s go back to my sports betting example. The smart contract that my friend and I are using for our bet needs to know who won the NBA finals in order to know whether to pay me or my friend. If that data is not being fed into our smart contract in a decentralized, trust-less manor then our contract itself is no longer decentralized and trust-less. That is where Chainlink comes in. Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that will allow trust-less data integration onto any blockchain. One of the most valuable aspects of Chainlink is that it is blockchain agnostic and can be used for any public, private, or permissioned blockchain. Currently one of their main focuses is to provide blockchain solutions for interbank telecommunications. They are working with Swift which is the main organization in this field.


Chainlink is not yet functional making it the riskiest endeavor of the 3, but it also has the highest potential for reward. There are currently no competitors in the decentralized oracle space. The reason being that the oracle problem is an incredibly difficult problem to solve and the creator of Chainlink has been working on it for over 4 years which is an eternity in the blockchain world. The main net is nearly complete and should be released within the next few months although there is no specific release date.


Once Chainlink is online, people will be able to run nodes to help feed data into smart contracts. The node operators will be paid for this service. Running a node is not as simple a staking, but there are companies such as Linkpool that will allow anyone to contribute their Link tokens to a node and enjoy some of the profits. This will have a similar effect as ETH in limiting the supply and likely increasing the price.


LINK price at the time of writing - $.26 
Market Cap - $95 Million



Many people are currently saying that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will never again reach their all time highs of last year, but let’s take a look at the numbers. The total crypto market cap at the all time high was approximately $800 Billion. This is not a large number to begin with, but it’s also inflated due to the way market cap is calculated in cryptocurrencies. Market cap is determined by coin supply multiplied by the last price per coin. This means that I could create my own coin right now with a supply of 1 million coins, sell 1 coin to 1 person for $1 and my coin would be said to have a market cap of $1 million. This is clearly not actually the case. That being said, even $800 billion is not much when you consider the fact that Apple just hit $1 Trillion by itself and that the dot com bubble didn’t burst until it reached a $2 trillion market cap.


Large financial institutions don’t have easy access to cryptocurrencies yet, but they are interested and they will have access very soon. Most likely in the form of a Bitcoin ETF. The last crypto bull run was fueled by retail investors. The next one will be fueled by institutional investors and it will be magnitudes greater in size.


Putting money into crypto right now is still risky, but the potential reward is massive. Not only for huge returns on your initial investment, but also for streams of passive income from currencies such as ETH and LINK. We may be seeing the beginning of the world’s next great technological innovation and this time you can invest in it directly. Opportunities like this don’t arise often, so I highly recommend giving this one some thought."

171,2018-08-15,Friendmann,2,Bullmarket? Lets take a look at European Banks!,"Hello everyone!

I've looked this monday into the European banks. At this day the European banks lost quitte a bit of value due to the drop of the Turkish lira. Before this drop the banks didn't perform well either. In the next document you can find a small investigation about the European banks. I've mainly looked towards the high dividend yields and the market. 

My English is not my native language and I am not a great writer too. I am sorry if there are many mistakes. 

While doing this research I had a bit of trouble making the investigation complete. The banking sector is a pretty huge one with lots of rules, risks and politics. The investigation is not really complete due to limited time and resources. I maybe am going to finish it further. But I feel now is a good moment to discuss European Banks. 

Click [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krmxBqJYxDhcapsVOpjSev9d6oIiwYwQ/view?usp=sharing) for my document about European banks

Click [**here**](https://www.stoxx.com/index-details?symbol=SX7GT) for the Stoxx Banks Indices

What I want to know from you guys are the next points.

* What do you think about the (European) banking sector right now?
* Are the European banks valued attractively right now?
* Should the European Banking sector be avoided because of high risks?
* Do you think banks can compete against technologic disruptive forces?
* Do you know more about the southern banks like BBVA and SAN? (Their stock prices are even below the stock prices of 2009)
* … 

I haven't added a conclusion in my research yet because I feel it is not complete.

My opinion about European banks is positive for the long term.  I believe the low stock prices of the banks are a good way to hedge you're portfolio against the high valued tech companies. The banking sector will not become a fast growing sector so you shouldn't expect fast money for it. Banks shall stay around for a long long time though. They invest in fintech to protect them from a disruptive future. They have more money than fintech companies alone. which makes them able to stay smart. Cryptocurrencies aren't forming a real threat with the new instant payment systems. Furthermore banks have more money and knowledge to compete against the cryptocurrency.

Tech companies like Facebook Amazon and Google can add banking activities. This would be a huge disruptive factor in the sector. But it is a pretty huge expensive and unlogic step for these companies. The bankingsector is hard to join because of the many rules banks are given. These companies need to create a lot of risks for the licenses and capital reserves etc joining a high competitive world with many huge players already in. If they succeed they become massive datamachines. knowing everything about a person. These companies are already sensitive with their privacypolicies, which will increase after adding banking information. 

Banks do have high risks. Bad economic events can bring the banks stock prices down further. The banks have a high dividend yield so you still have some dividend for compensation. Looking at the Stoxx banking index you see European Banks is already down more than 20% from it's high this year.

The European banks only increased 66% after the big drop in 2009. This is a high difference with the Europe 50 index which grew up to more than 160% after 2009.

So what do you think about European Banks?"

But seeing the sentiment from the beginning of the year go from everyone hating Bitcoin and other crypto's and wanting them banned, to seeing an endless amount of the biggest banks, hedge funds and investors enter the crypto space, with governments around the world reacting surprisingly positive, (not to mention all the developments within the crypto space itself) I thought this new Yale study might some interesting food for though on this sub. Although it'll probably be downvoted into oblivion :D Some might find it an interesting and well balanced perspective.

TLDR:
&gt;Keep in mind that we’re not offering investment advice, but it is a very basic question that one would ask about any asset class, and we approach the question at the end of our study. When you invest in your retirement, Vanguard or whatever platform you use will suggest how to best allocate your portfolio. We did the same for cryptocurrency. If you as an investor believe that Bitcoin will perform as well as it has historically, then you should hold 6% of your portfolio in Bitcoin. If you believe that it will do half as well, you should hold 4%. In all other circumstances, if you think it will do much worse, then you should still hold 1%. Of course, one has to remember that, as with any other assets, past performance is not a guarantee of future returns. Maybe cryptocurrency will completely change its behavior, but currently the market does not think it will.

News: Mining Power Group, Inc. (RCGR) Data Center Subsidiary Signs $6,480,000, Two-Year Hosting Contract With Client 

MIAMI, August 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RCGR's Recent Acquisition, Northway Mining, LLC. Brings Immediate Gains; Signs Major Client Contract For Crypto Miners; More To Come 

Mining Power Group, Inc., (the ""Company"" or ""RCGR"") (RCGR), announced today that its majority-owned subsidiary, Northway Mining, LLC, (""Northway"") which offers highly specialized data center hosting services for cryptomining, has signed a 2-year, $270,000 per month hosting contract with Proof Computing, LLC., a U.S.-based firm which will yield approximately $6,480,000 million in revenues to Northway over the two years. 

The contract encompasses the hosting of about 3,150 miners, including up to 25,000 GPU's, projected to consume about 5 MW hours of electricity per month. Under the terms of the contract, the client is paying a $540,000, or two-month, advance deposit for the hosting services which will cover installation, set up and equipment testing services by Northway. The contract runs from approximately August 1, 2018, to July 31, 2020, and is renewable. 

Northway is a cryptocurrency mining hosting facility that provides hosting, electricity, cooling, maintenance, insurance, downtime coverage, OS installation (GPU) assistance, setup and security, and more, including especially low rates for electricity, that reduces client costs and is a major competitive advantage in the marketplace. 

The Company had just recently acquired a majority interest in Northway Mining, which has current revenues. In addition, it acquired real estate assets of substantial value including 30 acres of flat surrounding land that will be used for future expansion of Northway's data center facilities. Northway presently has over 5000 square feet of secure crypto mining space.

**STREAMLINING TEDIOUS KYC PROCESSES FOR BUSINESSES WHILST ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO CONTROL THE FATE OF THEIR OWN IDENTITY.**

    PRICE:  $0.007826 USD
VOLUME 24H: $2,825,041 USD 
MARKET CAP: $19,004,582 USD 

PROBLEM TO SOLVE

Currently, we place an enormous amount of trust in centralised authorities to store and manage our identity. Such organisations entitle us to essential human rights such as financial services, citizenship/passport registration and business licenses. As with all centralised entities they are incredibly prone to hacking resulting from a single point of failure, all user data is stored in one single place. This has too often resulted in our identities being exploited for criminal purposes such as identity fraud, as seen in the Equifax hack where 143 million users identity were stolen from a central database.

Coupled with this inefficient management of sensitive data, the current process of completing mandatory KYC (Know Your Customer) processes for business is cumbersome, costly and repetitive. KYC ensures that client identities are fully assessed before any business relationships are formed to avoid the risk of illegal or fraudulent interactions. They span numerous jurisdictions and are therefore widely used by firms all over the world. Sharing sensitive identity data to numerous centralised databases has it proposed risks, but perhaps more poignant is how much time and energy is spent completing such a process repeatedly.

### 

### SOLUTION

Such inadequacies with the current status quo have lead Selfkey (KEY) to provide an innovative solution. In essence, KEY aim to empower individuals and businesses to possess full control over their own identities by eradicating the need for unnecessary and unsecure centralised intermediaries. Their digital identity system based on the Ethereum Blockchain will allow users to upload all necessary documentation to ensure they are fully compliant to pursue any venture which needs identity verification, whether this is for commercial or personal purposes. By combining all necessary documents in one place on their desktop and mobile app, which only the user has access to via their individual public key, applying for financial services, passport/citizenship and business endeavours that need KYC compliance becomes simple. Thus, for businesses, KEY eliminates the mundane and costly repetition of KYC registrations and for individuals, KEY allows easy access to essential services and ultimately empowering people to own their identity without relying on other unreliable middlemen.

### APPLICATIONS

Once the platform goes live in Q4 2019, individuals and businesses will be able to purchase a variety of products and services via the Selfkey marketplace utilising the KEY Token, including but not limited to, bank accounts, residency, KYC licences and real estate. Additionally one will be able to manage their cryptocurrency assets, including the KEY token itself and any other ERC-20 tokens. Conversely, unlike many other cryptocurrency firms, KEY already has a working beta of their desktop wallet which looks incredibly professional and KEY also provide an online demo of different functions the desktop wallet will be able to achieve in the future. In a space which is often incredibly difficult to understand from the outside, this a refreshing approach that allows users to gain a deeper insight into how the platform will function in the future. After all, as with all technology, once Blockchain technology is integrated into our daily lives the end users are unlikely to be interested in how things operate in the backend as long as they serve their desired purpose.

### 

### SUMMARY

Ultimately, Selfkey’s accumulation of necessary documents needed for typical business and personal interactions should reduce time and costs for both parties. KYC registration may be their killer application for businesses, whilst individuals ability to determine how to efficiently manage their own identity should gain further appeal. Still in its infancy, Selfkey has a bright future ahead of itself and if they live up to their roadmap they should become incredibly profitable for long-term investors. Be sure not to miss out!

### 

### CATALYSTS

* **Proven Ability:** Key team members behind Selfkey have already proved their ability to successfully manage a large-scale project from start-up to finish with their successful venture KYC Chain, a KYC solutions provider, that is already working with numerous blue-chip firms
* **Firm Foundations:** The interconnectivity between KYC Chain and Selfkey allows the business to focus solely on Blockchain development and user experience as the infrastructure and expertise in the business of KYC is already established
* **Consumer Awareness:** The major Equifax hack alongside the Cambridge Analytica Facebook scandal has lead to an increasing number of individuals becoming more aware of how their identity can be stolen or misused for illicit purposes, ensuring demand for having more control over one's own identity
* **Familiarity with KYC:** Every time one wishes to participate in an ICO they have to go through the KYC process, this is a repetitive and long-winded process which many cryptocurrency users are familiar with and would certainly avoid if possible, creating more demand

### 

### RISK FACTORS

* **Serious Competition:** There are other notable other firms trying to provide a digital identity solution using Blockchain technology such as Civic, which has been long established, although Selfkey’s clear advantage is the deep-rooted industry connections that KYC Chain has provided
* **Slow Timeline:** For a business that already has such firm industry foundations their timeline is not particularly fast, with continual developments throughout 2019, there will certainly be a race to become the market leader in the digital identity space, although it is also important that everything is completed to the highest of standards

### 

### EVENTS

* **30th September:** Alpha launch of SelfKey Corporate Identity Wallet desktop app, Alpha launch of SelfKey mobile app and Partnership work with governments and utility providers
* **31st December:** Beta launch of SelfKey desktop app

### 

### CONCLUSION

Selfkey is an innovative identity platform which aims to streamline the verification process for a variety of services by allowing both individuals and businesses to retain full ownership of their identity. KEY’s killer application is the ability to aggregate all information necessary for KYC processes in one place, whilst only allowing the user access to such information via their public key. This should save a considerable amount of time and expense for businesses all over the world who regularly must be KYC compliant before exchanging value with others.

Of course, this is merely one poignant application KEY offers, the platform will also provide individuals and businesses with access to financial services, citizenship, business licenses and health insurance, to name a few. It is likely the KYC validation market is where we will see KEY thrive first as a result of their successful parent company KYC Chain. Although, with such a wide-ranging market, opportunities for clients and growth are endless. For this reason, Selfkey is one not to miss out on and should be on your watchlist.

182,2018-08-03,UniversalBacon,0,I'm clueless and curious. Would love to begin mild investing but don't know where to start,"Hello everyone!

I'm 17, currently in high school, have a stable part-time job, and as I approach my 18th birthday I have become increasingly more interested in mild investing and would love to start once I am old enough. It's something I've always been interested in, but have never actually gone through with (flashback to early 2016 when I *almost* put $100 into the brand new Etherium cryptocurrency. *sigh* Hindsight is 20/20). **However**, now that i'm approaching adulthood I think I'm ready to actually invest. The areas that I've been paying most attention to for early investing are in certain mobile apps such as Acorns, Stash, and Robinhood. I know that these may be considered unconventional options in the world of modern investing, but the level of complexity seems to be mild enough to understand without much prior knowledge. I have friends who currently use Acorns, and the biggest upside seems to be the ""Set it and forget it"" midset you can adopt with this app. But after mild research it seems as though it has extremely mediocre and at times negative returns, even with an aggressive portfolio, so I'm not sure if that's the best option. Stash is essentially the same, but Robinhood allows you to invest in your own stocks. Robinhood seems like a solid option, but as I mentioned I am completely clueless and would have absolutely no idea what stocks to put my money into or where to invest in order to have some safe, mild gains.

My other big worry is with taxes. Currently all of my taxes are taken right out of my paycheck, so it's never been an issue for me when tax season rolls around. But investing opens up an entirely new can of worms that I am frankly terrified of.

Now that you know a bit about who I am, I need some advice. Where is best to start investing? What are your opinions on Acorns, Stash, and Robinhood? Are taxes something I should be legitimately worried about with investing? Am I an idiot for passing on Etherium before it **exploded** in value?

I'd love any and all opinions and advice!

185,2018-09-29,hemokwang,0,What Does DT Deflationary Era Inspire Us?,"**Introduction**

Several days ago, [DragonEx](https://dragonex.im/) announced that the production of Dragon Token would decrease by half as from November 2, 2018, according to the smart contract, and they would also reduce their token share to ensure that Dragon Token would step into a deflationary period, with the return of interests to their communities. 

**What are inflation and deplation of tokens?**

Inflation of tokens refers to a condition when there is too much supply of the token into the digital market leading to the decrease in value. On the other hand, deflation of tokens could imply decreasing production of this token which leads to increasing value of it. There has been inflation of [Dragon Token](https://dragonex.im/en-us/news/article/622?curIdx=-1) (DT) since it's launched on November 2, 2017. Technically, the inflation lowers the value of each DT on a daily basis. However, the condition is being different since the mining difficulty will increase from November 2, 2018 according to the DT Smart Contract. With the supply of DT reduced, the value of it will increase and be able to stabilize with time. At the same time, the inflation of DT will be significantly reduced which will then result to deflation of the token. 

**How DT inflation comes to an end?**

DT is generated through mining, with a total volume of 37,339,500. The smart contract releases once per 24-hour, which counts to 3,650 times in total. Each cycle consists of 365 releases and every release has 51,200 outputs of DT during the first cycle, which will be halved for the next cycle period. The whole process will be repeated and the production of DT will decrease which means that their value will gradually increase, leading to deflation mechanism.  

**DT deflationary era**

It was mentioned in the announcement [***With Great Effort and Commitment Comes Great Reward***](https://dragonex.im/en-us/news/article/1164?curIdx=0) on DragonEx, “DT (Dragon Token) Dividends have been distributed over 300 times so far, with more than 47 million USDT distributed to the DT community!  This works out to 9.11 USDT per DT held.” According to the smart contract, the production of this token will keep on decreasing. And in the meanwhile, the repurchased dragon token will be burned to ensure a shift occurs from inflation to deflation.

**How does DT** **deflation work?** 

By November 2, 2018, it is estimated that about 18,688,000 DT will have released. According to the DT smart contract, the production of DT will decrease from 51,200 to 25,600 every 24 hours. Thereafter, DragonEx team will burn the permanent frozen DT that is not in the market circulation so that the total amount of DT will never go beyond 18,688,000. The trend is expected to continue even for the coming years such that by November 2, 2019, the share of DT held by DragonEx will be reduced from 50% to 25%, whereby at the same date 2020 it will have reduced to 12.5%.  

As the mining of token regresses, the decrement cycle of the dragon token will enter into the deflation period. Assuming that everything in the market remains at its expected condition, and then this will imply that a reduction in holding capacity is in good faith to maintain the stability of investors' interest.

**What can we learn from this?**

The majority of the tokens issued by blockchain technology are in the inflation phase. Only a few that has adopted the new deflation trend because it's still a new concept in the market. It is observed that it’s difficult to control huge inflation in a broad-based blockchain technology when it's still in early stages. However, it becomes very necessary for another developmental phase so that a coin or token maintains its value. In general, the deflation mechanism is expected to assist stabilizing cryptocurrency project and attract investors to do investment when is more stable with high equity value. 

However, will it work?  And who will be the next DragonEx? 

Let’s wait and see!"

**A little about me:** I started investing in the stock market in my 20s. I won some, I lost some but overall I basically just followed the normal growth trend found in the market over time. Around 2010, I started to hear about Bitcoin and as a CS engineer I found it very interesting but lacking the foundations to take a dive. I changed my mind in 2011 and bought a few dozen BTC. Once I actually had some BTC I kinda lost interest, that is until about 2013 when a kid named Vitalik started posting about his upcoming project on a bitcoin forum I went to occasionally. The way he envisioned a truly programmable blockchain versus just using blockchain for cryptocurrency blew me away to say the least. By this point the in-fighting in BTC was starting to develop quickly, I could feel the community become more toxic. So I moved my originally tiny investment to Ethereum...I figured why the hell not. 

**Back to my more traditional investing:** I have been steadily contributing to my portfolio throughout my adult life. I have worked for a few companies and *once had* a decent traditional portfolio. That changed around August of this year, when I began DCAing into the crypto-market and divesting ~80% of my traditional portfolio to enter my favorite crypto-assets. I now hold roughly 90% crypto-assets and ~10% traditional stocks, and since the investment I have been surprisingly comfortable with the added risk in my portfolio. Below is what I have found out so far by making this big leap:

**The Good:** I have to say it feels kind of nice and extremely odd to be able to actually buy things online directly with my investments if and when I choose to, without having to involve a broker or bank. I have chosen to twice so far, mainly for experimentation. Both were just as fast as a credit card purchase online, with a cost of roughly ~$0.001. The other good part is thus far I have actually gained money compared to what my traditional portfolio would currently be worth if I had kept it in. Let's see if this trend continues. I obviously believe it will or I wouldn't have done this lol. Not only that, with 0x rolling out traditional securities soon I will be able to seamlessly buy back into what ever stock I feel like and rebuild my traditional portfolio from within the crypto-asset world when I feel like it is time. Also, I have already opened my own MakerDAO CDP and have locked in my current dollar cost while holding a huge amount of my wealth in the stablecoin DAI. So even though I am technically in a very volatile asset (ETH), I still get the perks of holding something that *thus far* has shown itself to be as stable as the USD. 

**The Bad:** This ecosystem is still in its infancy in *many but not all ways.* Your personal understanding of computer science and IT security are still massively important at this stage. So unless you plan to solely use a custody service such as Fidelity, Coinbase, etc., which are perfectly good options, you had better not make the leap yet. I'm not sure if I should categorize this as a bad but I do feel that I am much more involved with and thinking about my portfolio. It's much different from just trusting a brokerage currently, and because of this I am constantly learning about this area of technology and business. You kinda have to be hands on at this point. The only other bad I have found is that bad people are out there, and the threat of them stealing your stuff is high. **You must be completely aware of this and act accordingly.** "

These are good if you want to get into crypto but you don't trust cryptocurrency exchanges. They also may be useful if you think bitcoin / alt coins are going down so you can short some of these. I recommend Interactive Brokers (IB) as a stock exchange in general especially for shorting.

207,2018-10-15,ForexMoronFriend,1,UPDATE- Is Forex legit? Worried about a friend. Update after showing my previous post to said friend and what his reply was.,"Yesterday I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9o5jrh/is_forex_market_legit_or_a_scam_worried_about_a/) post about a friend who has been investing for a year in Forex and hasn't made any money.  

I deleted my OP because I wanted to send him the link to read the comments but I didn't want him to know my reddit username. I'm posting from a throwaway in case he decided to peruse around here I still don't want him to find my username.

**This is my OP**___________________________

 Is forex market legit? Worried about a friend who's been doing it for a year and is still not making money, he refuses to get a job because he hopes to score big any time soon.

My friend studied computer science, he had an office job doing apps but he quit because he demanded they raise his wages after not even 3 months working there, claiming the company was making money off his work and not paying him a %. We tried to explain to him that’s how most jobs work, you make the same amount and the company pockets all big profits. 

So he quit and has been for the last year working in, I quote ‘investing in forex market, cryptocurrency and stocks’. None of us in our group of friends have any idea what that’s about and when asked to explain he told us his job is to sit in front of the screen pressing F5 for hours, watching the forex market, when asked if he’s investing in bitcoin he says it’s other type of cryptocurrency but he won’t give us the name or go into detail.

The thing is that we’re worried about him because for the last year he’s not made any money whatsoever, he’s always broke and asking to borrow from us, he’s struggling economically but doesn’t wanna hear anything about getting a job because he insists there’s money in forex market but he’s got to wait till he hits jackpot.  He’s always been one of those people who wanted to get rich fast and easy.

We think is a huge waste of energy and resources, since he could be making money with a proper job and doing this on the side instead of full time. He’s also doing some online jobs like making websites and programming, but we think the site he works for is dodgy as hell since he’s always telling us how he has trouble when withdrawing the money they own him, they either freeze his account or demand a minimum amount before he can cash out his money. 

Part of the reason he’s also doing this kind of jobs is to save up and invest more money in Forex market, hoping to one day being able to invest $200. His words, I don’t know if that’s a set amount to invest or something. So far he’s invested much smaller amounts than $200.

So in resume, we think this all sounds very weird and we’re worried Forex market isn’t legit and he’s got himself in a sticky situation. 

**I showed it to him before to read the comments and this was his reply**________________________________


Ok I am reading, so far so good. They are just bunch of idiots to me,  who go on reddit and type comments to get points, they don’t know nothing about me.
 Nope,  I am gonna do what I think is right for me, don't care what others say or do, this people don't feed me or pay my bills, my parents do. You can’t change me nor can anybody. You don't know what u are talking about at all.
I’m not gonna argue, you just read stuff online, until you try forex for yourself I won’t listen to you.
Reddit means nothing. They don’t know nothing, has anyone said that I have done forex and lost money, nobody can say it, because they never tried, they are all like ‘I know  friend who did it…’. And they are all genius right? Reading and commenting in reddit, not doing anything. I just said I don’t wanna listen to anyone and do what I wanna do.


So I agree with another commenter who said 'you can take a horse to the water but you can't make him drink'. If my friend wants to spend his entire days watching forex and remain broke rather than get a job then so be it. At least now we now who's paying his bills and food, but I's be  beyond ashamed if my family was as in much debt as his family is and he not only wants to get a job but he's ok with his parents paying his food and bills at his age (36).

It's clear when presented with evidence that he wasn't doing forex the right way or wouldn't get rich doing it, instead of listening he thought everybody was stupid but him and got pretty defensive. I can't do anymore for him and he said it very clearly, he doesn't wanna listen to anyone."

of course europe and other central bank controlled nations have been behaving similarly lax with the fiscal policy.

now my big question to the pros: what kind of necessity is there, for central banks to hike interest rates as so many are expecting, cause I don't get it...why can't they just keep printing money? who can and who must pop this bubble, and if so, why?

I have been offered an investment opportunity through my colleague. Its a private investment club company incorporated in Sweden by his family member. Some of my colleagues already put in tens of thousands euros into it. In fact some have even taken out loans for this. I am staying away from it, because for me it sounds too good to be true but I would like to hear your input:

* the Key Investor Information document mentions trading mostly FIAT currencies and some cryptocurrency
* the (programmer) colleague told me that he coded a special trading algorithm for this company (owned by his family member) that does high frequency trading
* access fee to be able to join the platform, 30€ or so + 2%/20% from investment/profit
* they have several funds which are opened periodically and if you enter them, you cant exit them for a set period of time, else you would have to pay a 8% fee
* look [at the image here](https://imgur.com/a/oanVyd5) for the returns (its the return for the set amount of time), the average annualized return rate could be perhaps 80%!
* the most shady thing - they have a graph of daily profits and the line is absolutely smooth, in fact there is not a single day with a loss, [see the picture (the green line are the profits)](https://imgur.com/a/gEJC3aR) and the profits are +- same every day. I have been told that its because they have been capped by the Swedish finance regulator - literally because they are ""making too much profit"" otherwise they would be making even bigger profits. Is that possible?
* the colleague encourages more people to enter and always tells people that they should move their profits from one fund after it expires to a new fund in the dashboard
* they insist that they know the founder etc. so I can trust this whole thing

Could this be legit? Or is it a pyramid/ponzi scheme? "
223,2018-11-21,AWAX_Blockchain,1,New CryptoCurrency Investment and Banking Solution,"  

The AWAX Platform is brand new and still currently in its Pre-ICO stage (Until the 15th of December this year). It will offer a universal banking and exchange solution not only limited to standard Fiat Money transfers but the top 100 kinds of cryptocurrency as well, its most important features revolving around the interaction and flexibility between these assets.

The Platform will give any users with a PoA (Proof of Asset) Token the ability to broker exchanges between Cryptocurrency, fiat currency and real-world assets instantly, with volume-based trading discounts and taker fees that can be as low as 0.1%. Another feature entwined into this platform is the ability for users to instantly convert cryptocurrency to fiat money and back again, and cash out instantly – this cuts out the middle men and enables AWAX to keep the transactions secure, fast and inexpensive. 

The company’s mission is to use blockchain technology to eliminate the limited nature of older economic systems and with this, to develop tools to make access to instruments currently reserved solely for financial institutions simple, affordable and safe.

AWAX will help all private investors diversify their portfolios beyond cryptocurrencies and utility tokens – helping them reduce the overall risk due to cryptocurrency’s somewhat volatile nature. Along with this, other benefits help with the following:

· Significantly lowers the cost of investing in assets through the removal of middlemen and the pooling investment volume

· Enables the creation of more steady returns in the form of dividends, coupons and platform loyalty points

· Hedges the systemic risks involved in a volatile market

· Minimises the bureaucratic overheads

· Empower everyone to invest directly in global funds in every market, regardless of fund or investor location – massive geographical flexibility

The platform is not only limited to private investors however, with the same help being offered to institutional investors, to invest in a diversified digital currency portfolio without having to worry about holding multiple different wallets across several different exchange platforms.

The AWAX platform is the Investment, Exchange and Banking solution of the future, and has the potential to transform the approach to and use of a multitude of currencies the world over.

225,2018-11-19,spicy_salsa25,1,Need advise on how to go from long-term investing to mid-term investing,"  

47 years old, have had a charmed life so far; while I’m divorced, I have an amicable relationship with her and we share custody of some fantastic young boys

My parents and I invested in a bank repossessed property (very lucky, not something that could be repeated) in the early 90’s; I’ve sold it and netted $500k (after taxes) for each family member (myself included) – my share is sitting on the sidelines and I don’t know what to do with it.

I invested throughout the dotcom (1990’s) era, took my money out before the bubble burst and invested in a hotel (again, very lucky and not something I could do again); this property currently nets me \~$20k/year (before taxes) in passive income but it’s likely that the property will have to be sold in the next three years, netting me at least $150k.

I retired for many years, went back to work (\~$75k/year), and between my 401k and IRA, now have $100k saved up; I’ve moved that out of stocks and into bonds about one month ago so as to limit my exposure (great move so far).

My goal was to invest the $500k (plus the additions $150k when it becomes available) into index funds and let it grow to let’s say $3M over the next 20 years so I could retire for good while still being able to support my children, now and into the future. To see if I could get better returns, I have $10k that I use to pick specific stocks and/or cryptocurrency- given my horrendous performance so far (-25%), that appears to be a losing strategy, so I don’t see myself doing the same investing on a larger scale. 

Overall, my life has been great.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the bad – I was diagnosed with MS four years ago. Some days, I feel perfectly normal; other days, not so normal and I have to accept the fact that I won’t be working long-term and could be in a wheelchair (or worse) within a few years.  Lately, the frequency of the not so hot days has increased.  How it turns out, nobody knows but this uncertainty has me worried that I won’t be able to work much longer … and has thrown off my long-term retirement plans as investing in an index fund, waiting 20 years for my investment to triple or quadruple appears less and less viable.  And while I currently don’t need too much to keep me going (expenses of about $4.5k, including child support), I’m feeling the pressure to build a nest egg to support future medical expenses and/or child expenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, in summation, I currently have $100k in the market, I’m in real estate generating passive income (that will likely go away) leaving me with $650k to invest but my long-term view is clouded with an MS diagnosis that is dramatically accelerating my need to build out a larger nest egg … but I’ve run out of ideas on how to.

228,2018-11-17,bitseven,1,Romanian Authorities Investigate Illegal Crypto Financing of Movements," In an attempt to combat subversive movements that have appeared in the country recently, DIICOT is looking into cryptocurrency transactions that went to several organizations. 

 The Romanian Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) is currently investigating the way in which the “Rezist” movement is financed, suspecting organizations within the movement of organized crime and money laundering, Mediafax [**reports**](https://www.mediafax.ro/social/diicot-ancheteaza-finantarea-rezist-sunt-vizate-tranzactii-cu-cryptomonede-de-15-milioane-de-dolari-17657075).

Some of these organizations include Declic, an NGO used to support movements within the nation that organize protests in Bucharest, and others like VaVedem, Corupția Ucide, Oradea Civic, Funky Citizens, Just, and Rezistența TV. Results from the investigation so far, which consist of a scan of unspecified cryptocurrency addresses tied to Rezist movement, reveal 403 transactions and a total of $14.9 million transferred in the last three years.

&amp;#x200B;

 According to Mediafax’s source, the public prosecutor in charge of the investigation is looking into the fact that all of the transactions could have come from the Stefan Batory Foundation in Poland, an organization in partnership with George Soros.

It’s worth mentioning here that DIICOT’s suspicions are not tied to protests held at the end of January 2017, when hundreds of thousands of people from around the country gathered in Bucharest to decry legislation that would have *de facto* legalized corruption among politicians.

Instead, authorities are more concerned with the source of financing for the August 10 protests, where a remarkable number of citizens from the diaspora came home to Romania to participate. The action culminated in a number of violent incidents between protesters and police with no clear consensus on who instigated them.

The protests themselves didn’t appear to have any clear trigger, instead appearing to be spontaneous. The motive was to demand the resignation of social democrat prime minister Viorica Dancilă.

Investigators believe that the enormous sums had something to do with the August 10 protests as hundreds of thousands of dollars were withdrawn from the pot just a few weeks before they happened.

With 403 transactions, the accumulation rate of funds could be calculated to a whopping $36,972.70 per transaction. For a protest in Romania, this is a remarkable sum."

242,2018-11-02,daniilgor,1,Monaco As a Potential Crypto Haven: Will the Monaco International Blockchain Conference Provide the Answers?,"One of the biggest issues that the investors in the domain of blockchain and related technologies face in multiple ways is the regulatory uncertainty.

The first manifestation of this problem lies in the attempts by many regulators to fit the novelties presented by the domain into the old regulatory straitjacket. One of the most important examples is the treatment of the digital assets by the US SEC. In this approach, essentially any asset whose value depends on the efforts of an identifiable group of people (even ETH at the moment of its issuance) becomes a security.

At the same time, some or even all competent authorities leave certain aspects of the blockchain and related technologies without any clear official interpretation. For instance, almost nowhere in the world are blockchain ledgers recognized as a legitimate source of legal evidence, despite the fact that they may well in many cases be more reliable than the old ways of documenting things. Among other things, this makes it challenging to prove the provenance of certain important transactions, for instance for the purpose of establishing the initial acquisition value of digital assets.

Another major hurdle created mostly by the anti-money laundering regulation concerns the capacity of blockchain-related projects to forge banking relationships. Most banks appear to be so afraid of the potential sanctions that they prefer to avoid dealing with blockchain-related projects as much as possible. The case that best illustrates this is the effective forcing of the cryptocurrency-based prepaid card providers like Xapo and BitPay to leave the European market in the beginning of this year.

Finally, in many countries, digital asset holders have little clarity with respect to the treatment of their gains or losses from the tax perspective. This may well drive away many potential investors, especially those without an extremely high tolerance for risk, probably leaving the cryptocurrency investment space dominated by early adopters and high-risk speculators, which does not necessarily make for well-functioning crypto asset markets.

The difficulties caused by the regulatory uncertainty of course do not mean that the regulators would help if they chose the other extreme, namely, a detailed stifling blockchain-specific set of rules. The development of the world wide web should serve as an inspiration here as it took place in the absence of either of those extremes.

Realistically, though, it is hard to expect major countries’ governments to show leadership as far as blockchain regulation is concerned. They tend to either face other problems that are perceived to be much more pressing politically or they tend to place too much emphasis on objectives (such as maximizing tax receipts, curbing drug trade, maintaining tight control over the money supply and so on) that, if pursued too vigorously, are incompatible with creating optimal conditions for open experimentation in the blockchain space.

On the other hand, relatively small, more or less developed countries like Switzerland, Malta and Mauritius, have already positioned themselves far ahead of the larger counterparts in this respect. Such countries, unsurprisingly, tend to be the first playgrounds for innovative practices, especially in finance-related domains.

However, the position of any individual small crypto haven may change at any moment because of the external pressure by countries that are important to them from the economic or strategic standpoint, economic difficulties, political upheavals and other factors. That is why, it is arguably crucial for the ultimate success of the blockchain space as a whole for it to be able to potentially rely on a range of crypto havens to choose from.

This is where the potential position of Monaco comes in. The Principality has so far been largely flying under the radar compared to, for instance, Malta or Switzerland in terms of its legal approach to the blockchain but in January this year its elected National Council actually approved Bill 237 specifically devoted to the regulation of the blockchain space. (text in French). Amazingly, no major news outlet, crypto-focused or otherwise, has covered this major development.

Although there does not seem to have been any updates on the developments around this bill, according to the analysis by Mark Lipskier, at least on paper, it appears to be very promising because of its generalist approach [1], perhaps, so far without precedent anywhere else. Interestingly, the aforementioned AMB is supposed to be a “body of private law”, and during three years it will be uniquely responsible for blockchain regulation, as well as for overseeing 13 development programs.

During the aforementioned 3-year experimentation period, Article 7 of the bill provides that the enterprises interested in collaborating with the principality in developing solutions based on blockchains, smart contracts, algorithmic enterprises and cryptocurrencies will receive material assistance, as well as a guarantee of no hindrances from the regulatory perspective.

The bill also spells out the definitions of important terms such as blockchains, smart contracts, algorithmic enterprises [2] and cryptocurrencies, and recognizes blockchain technology-enabled ledgers as a form of legally binding document creation facilitating the usage of ledger contents in all kinds of legal contexts.

Despite its great promise, however, the passed bill in itself contains only very general terms and probably cannot be applied to actual cases directly, especially in a continental law jurisdiction such as Monaco. Thus, the ultimate effect of the bill will depend on the further regulatory actions will be promptly taken to substantiate its provisions. It also needs to be clarified what kind of material assistance blockchain-related enterprises can apply for, in what manner, and what exactly the no regulatory hindrance guarantee will imply in practice.

This is why the upcoming Monaco International Blockchain conference on November 29–30 may be of particular interest, especially the session devoted to regulation. One of the speakers during that session will be the founder of the Word of Blockchains Monaco Thierry Poyet, the author of the aforementioned bill. One has to hope that he will cover the developments around the blockchain law, and I also hope to be able to discuss with him personally in more detail or even arrange an interview, as I am planning to attend the conference.

In any case, stay tuned for my post-conference update which I will definitely provide here.

[1] With the caveat that I so far only managed to access the text of the bill and not the adopted law. It is, however, unlikely, that the adopted law differs from the draft in major respects.

[2] This term appears to refer to decentralized autonomous organizations but it is not wholly clear whether it is limited just to them."

247,2018-12-25,gozargun,1,Learn this framework to choose the most profitable cryptocurrencies &amp; ICOs,"Lately, I have been researching a lot in order to create the most advanced cryptocurrency &amp; ICO valuation framework ever developed, and now, I am proud to announce that it is finally ready and available at the link below.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UQNpC8ZLVFFWWHMiX\_bN3i\_ary9qDcL3kQOUKHFocyo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UQNpC8ZLVFFWWHMiX_bN3i_ary9qDcL3kQOUKHFocyo/edit?usp=sharing)

In this post, I am going to basically introduce what this framework is and how it works. You will be able to find further details on the spreadsheet itself.

Firstly, let’s begin by saying this framework follows a mathematical methodology to calculate the potential Return on Investment (ROI) of cryptocurrency and ICO assets. That’s the main goal.

The framework, which I humbly call ‘Ozargun Valuation Framework (OVF)’, checks how well existing cryptocurrencies &amp; upcoming ICO tokens rank with regard to 10 main topics called ‘Product’, ‘Market’, ‘Project’, ‘Team’, ‘Community’, ‘Activity’, ‘Token’, ‘ICO’, ‘Legal’, and ‘Other’.

Next, there are another 86 subtopics under these main topics which have various weights in overall score calculation, depending on the sub-topic’s significance in the potential success of the asset. Some examples to sub-topics are: ‘Product type’, ‘Business model’, ‘Audience size’, ‘Marketing campaigns’, ‘Token utility’, ‘Competitor benchmark’… Examining this many sub-topics actually makes the framework the most comprehensive due diligence (fundamental analysis) tool ever developed for cryptocurrencies.

To evaluate some example cryptocurrencies with the framework I created, I initially ran a manual screening process to the first 500 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap, and picked the ones I saw potential in, adding them to this list. Some of these were later removed from the list as I found out they had significant weaknesses. There are currently 34 cryptocurrencies already evaluated on the spreadsheet.

I think all of the cryptocurrencies on this list with scores over 80 have great potential to be successful in the long-term, and to provide their investors’ great return on investment ratios. If a portfolio were to be created out of these assets, I would recommend allocation of funds correlated with the overall score of the assets.

According to the results of the applied framework, top 20 cryptocurrencies with the highest potential of ROI are:

1— [Aion Network](https://aion.network/)

2 — [Mainframe](https://mainframe.com/)

3 — [Loom Network](https://loomx.io/)

4 — [IOTA](https://www.iota.org/)

7 — [Egretia](https://egretia.io/)

12 — [IoTeX](https://iotex.io/)

13 — [Stellar](https://www.stellar.org/)

14 — [Cardstack](https://cardstack.com/)

15 — [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)

16 — [Steem](https://www.steem.com/)

17 — [NEM](https://nem.io/)

18 — [Wanchain](https://wanchain.org/)

19 — [ArcBlock](https://www.arcblock.io/)

20 — [Aelf](https://aelf.io/)

This list is the result of a battle-tested (according to the current market condition) scientific methodology, is not an investment advice, and may prove wrong. There are also several cryptocurrencies I still want to analyze and add to the spreadsheet as I find the necessary time. Yet, this framework provides the most advanced valuation methodology we have today with regard to investing in cryptocurrencies.

I believe this framework would have become a very valuable private tool for venture capitalists and due diligence experts but I wished to make it open-source for the whole community to benefit. That’s why it’s public and you can copy, use, distribute it with the condition that you refer to the original file, and the creator. Oh, wait a minute, that’s me! :) Yup.

To use the framework yourself, you are going to need to download the file; choose a cryptocurrency to evaluate; rate every subtopic between 1–5 depending on how strong you think the project is on that matter; order all of the assets according to their final scores; then allocate your funds to each of the assets according to their scores; and that's it! More information can be found on the spreadsheet itself.

Happy christmas and moon-ROI investing!

A planned crypto-based exchange traded fund (ETF) by Badoer Group ADK ETF is taking shape in Kenya. The ADK ETF is poised to be the world’s first crypto ETF listing and other procedures have been confirmed for the proposed launch in the first quarter of 2019.

The founder of ADK, Ricardo Badoer, was in Kenya last week to finalise the ETF listing arrangement with the Nairobi Securities Exchange. He met with the NSE’s commercial director, Ms Bahati Morara, and the head of Innovation and Project Management, Mr Irungu Wagema.

The crypto space has been clamouring for an ETF especially in the last two years. The premise is that an ETF will ensure some form of regulation in the crypto industry and expose the new asset class to many investors. However, attention has been focused on the US, and its financial regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to approve an ETF but most applications have either been rejected or decisions postponed.

Despite being in an uncharted crypto ETF space with rooms to learn along the way, ADK’s expected debut with an Africa-based ETF seeks to bring high value to the cryptocurrency as it opens the market to mainstream investors. It will also make it easy for regular investors, especially those who invest in the stock market, to own cryptocurrencies without having to deal with the technical knowledge involved.

Since the ADK ETF will be fully regulated by a stock exchange, it would attain a legal tender status and thus relieve investors of any tax or banking issues. About 50% of the total ADK in supply would be available for the ETF, that is 12.5 millionADK. Interested investors in the ETF would have to open an account through a broker and pass KYC (know your customer) scrutiny to gain access to the NSE.

ADK is also working to expand its banking network: Badoer owns 16% shares in Sumac Bank in Kenya and 23% in a Tanzania’s Hakika Microfinance Bank. There is a plan to launch an EU-based bank in coming months.

These moves are to ensure investors have access to ADK wallets and full exchange to trade ADK for fiat in their bank accounts within seconds. These accounts could be linked directly to ADK bank debit cards or fiat could be transferred to other banks. The bank-related usage of ADK is expected to lead to higher demand and value.

ADK is an open source project that focuses on privacy, decentralisation and scalability. It is a secure, private and untraceable solution to the problem of a lack of financial privacy as it can process crypto to fiat transactions in seconds.

These fluctuations are just a minor bump in the road that will eventually lead to a strong economy of cryptocurrencies. One of the initial questions that potential investors ask themselves is how much to invest in this new market?

I believe that you should understand the function and purpose of all these topics before you put any money into cryptocurrency.  If you have ever found yourself lost in cryptocurrency lingo, I hope this paper sheds some light on the esoteric technology."
260,2018-12-13,hello_again_world,1,Cryptocurrency - does it have any impact?,"This is in no way meant to be a shill on crypto. If you check my post history I've been involved in different crypto subs for over a year now, very heavily. I want to probe for opinions from more mainstream thinkers outside of the echo chamber I've found myself in.

First I want to specify my prompt a bit more: My question concerns Ethereum. Ethereum has changed radically in the past year to the point where some of you may not be aware. There are currently fully functional, decentralized money markets built on smart contracts for various cryptos. There is a system of collateralized debt positions where a USD-pegged token called DAI can be minted by collaterallizing Ether. There are a multitude of trustless decentralized exchanges where assets can be frictionlessly traded. There is a compliant gold-backed token called DigixDAO. There are decentralized leverage vehicles, option contracts and other derivatives, etc.

The userbase is extremely low, there is a high barrier to entry, and Ethereum itself is obviously extremely volatile.

I guess my question is just what do you folks think the implications of all this are? I've been operating in a community which treats world domination by this system of decentralized finance as an inevitability, and that's what I've come to believe as well playing with all these applications for myself. Yet the vast majority of people obviously don't feel that way. They typically aren't educated, and make poor or outdated arguments(Not real money! Ponzi Scheme! Only for criminals!), which is part of why I've remained convinced that crypto is the future.

What is your objective assessment of the critical points of failure facing this kind of system? I certainly won't get upset - completely tear it apart if you have the rationale. I look forward to it, in fact.

As a disclosure: I have my entire life savings in ETH, XRP, and a few other cryptos. And yes, I have lost a lot of my money. Also, I have posted this prompt into other finance/economics subs. "
