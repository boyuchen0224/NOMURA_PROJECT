0,2017-03-14,purplexy,0,Thoughts on DarcMatter as an alternative investment model?,"They purport to provide investors direct access to alternative investment vehicles. I had come across them while raising money for a fund but can't find any discourse about their model or company. A few articles lack critical insight. 

From the perspective of a fund, they seem to serve the same purpose as an investment bank, but are massively undercutting the market on their fees. And as an investor, it promises to open up new opportunities. 

On first look it appears to be backed by a credible team that transitioned out of the investment banking industry, with significant traction.

This isn't an endorsement, I merely wanted to instigate some discourse about the company/opportunity. 

Does anybody have any perspective on industry trends and whether these types of fintech firms are here to stay or an unsustainable attempt at disruption? Would you consider using them as an investor? Or as a fund manager? Why or why not?"

6,2017-08-30,guyquant,0,Let's discuss Robo Advisors,"I did a little project on FinTech and I got fascinated by the idea of AI and Roboadvising platforms. For those not familiar Robo-Advisors is not something as cool as it sounds, it's basically a software where you put all your details and it will make a recommendation on what assets you should buy according to your profile. Betterment is a Robo-Advisor platform that with minimal effort it places a low cost, low tax, diversified portfolio. So far I like it, it's been 7 months and I think I'm going to reach an 11% this year. What are your thoughts on Robo Advisor? what experience have you had in this platform? or others?


This is not my only investing platforms, I have a portfolio in Vanguard, Charles Schwab, and in crypto currency websites "

10,2017-10-11,InterestingNews1,19,"Lending Club is a fast growing fintech company with a compelling story and attractive valuation. With governance issues resolved, capital providers returning and trillions of dollars of loans out there waiting to be disrupted – the stock looks ready to take off","The company likes to place itself as the banking industry’s equivalent of Netflix, Spotify or Expedia, saying it is turning “the banking system into a frictionless, transparent and highly efficient online marketplace, helping people achieve their financial goals every day.” Borrowers get faster and cheaper access to loans, and lenders get higher returns than if they had placed their money in a bank.  

However, the company was hit last year by a scandal regarding internal controls and governance.  Not an Enron scale scandal but damaging for a financial institution that relies on confidence and brought increased regulatory scrutiny.  Most importantly the reputational damage hit originations and growth as capital providers, essential for loan growth, avoided the platform.
The stock fell below $4.50 having traded above $25 after an IPO at $15.  

As a result the CEO/founder Renaud Laplanche was replaced by Scott Sanborn last June. Mr Sanborn has reached out to capital providers to reboot growth.  His strategy has succeeded with Q2 results showing a 35% increase in revenues with 10% increase in originations.  Revenues are now forecast to exceed the Q1 2016 level (prior to the scandal) next quarter Q3 and accelerate growth in Q4.

The valuation now looks appealing.  At yesterdays close of $6.45 the company had a market cap of $2.6bn which means, adjusting for cash, the company trades on a P/S ratio of c.3.5.

Lending Club itself has raised its guidance and says “We are excited about the momentum building in the business and the massive opportunity that lies ahead”.

With governance issues resolved, capital providers returning and trillions of dollars of loans out there waiting to be disrupted – I would be excited too.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are not suitable for all investors. Please do your own research."
11,2017-11-03,geekmonk,1,Can apps that track investments be used to develop contrarian investment strategies?,"Read an article about apps that track investments and tell users what other people are doing like stocks they are buying, amount they are saving etc. How would you use such information to develop or improve your investment strategy? The first thing that popped in my mind was to use it for a contrarian bias. Any other ideas?

12,2017-11-03,shane_stockflare,33,An alternative to Yahoo Finance's API and a home for Google Finance users? Try IEX :),"It's been a long time coming, as @yahoo said:

&gt; It has come to our attention that this service is being used in violation of the Yahoo Terms of Service. As such, the service is being discontinued. 

So what's an alternative?

@Stockflare we've been a long term customer of Thomson Reuters, but for the last 6 months, we've also been consuming data from the IEX (remember the heros of the FlashBoys book?). 

Not only **is the IEX API top class... it is free.** See: https://iextrading.com/developer/

To *vent your fury* there are two good threads:

* Yahoo https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/7ad8ns/yahoo_kills_yahoo_finance_api_the_service_which/
* Google https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/79heov/rip_google_finance_you_will_be_missed/

Personally, I'm not surprised. For better or worse, YQL was being ""abused"" / used by some fintech startups to launch MVPs. I suspect the underlying content owners, were annoyed their data was leaking out, without being paid. A real shame. As this probably hurts innovation.

And if you'd like to test out the Stockflare API, please ping me privately. Though it's not available for commercial use. Only research and testing. *Sorry, we don't want to end up disappointing like YQL*."
