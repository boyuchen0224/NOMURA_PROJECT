2,2019-01-22,lagerbaer,1,"An analogy regarding ""TA"" versus Algo trading","Inspired by yesterday's XKCD cartoon post, there were lots of comments discussing how real quant / algo funds use TA to great success, and a lot of other comments ridiculing the idea of drawing lines over a price chart and trying to divine future price movements from it.

In a book (Advances in Financial Machine Learning) I read a nice analogy to this. Paraphrased:

If, today, you think you can grab a shovel, pickaxe and pan, move to the Yukon and strike it rich by looking for gold, you are severely mistaken. Gold just doesn't lie around on the surface any more. You won't stumble ass-backwards into a motherlode. On the other hand, the big mining corporations extract a shitton (metric) of gold. Way more gold than was mined in the entire 16th century by the famous Spanish treasure fleets. But it's microscopic amounts that you have to extract in complicated chemical process out of an even greater shitton of worthless earth and ore.

If you have to do the tools and knowledge, there's lots of gold around. If you're just one guy with some scrappy tools, there's just no way. Same with technical analysis. You need a whole research team of analysts to sift through raw data, process it, search for significant features, develop a trading strategy and actually successfully turn insight into money. Squinting at squiggly lines won't get you there. So basically, there's loads of alpha to be extracted, but it's microscopic and needs loads of know-how."

&gt; 
&gt; 	Two-fifths of Europe’s artificial intelligence start-ups do not use any AI programs in their products, according to a report that highlights the hype around the technology.
&gt; 
&gt; The research by London-based investment firm MMC Ventures could not find any evidence, based on public information and interviews with executives, of artificial intelligence applications at 40 per cent of 2,830 AI start-ups in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, the companies are often described as AI-focused, said David Kelnar, MMC’s head of research, who added that many start-ups had plans to develop machine-learning programs, an application of AI that sees computers automatically learn and improve from experience, in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; Almost 8 per cent of European start-ups founded last year were AI companies, compared with about 3 per cent in 2015, MMC’s research showed, with the UK taking the lead. The UK has been home to some of the most high-profile AI businesses, which have been bought by foreign buyers, such as Google’s DeepMind, Microsoft’s SwiftKey and Twitter’s Magic Pony.

&gt;However, investors said the industry would have to cut through a growing frenzy around the sector. “Getting stuck in buzzwords is never a good thing,” said Simon Cook, chief executive of Draper Esprit. “AI has become a catch-all phrase that’s often used flippantly.”

Either way, you wouldn’t be on this page wondering how to get really rich with your own business. No worries, here you’ll realize what things you can do with the money amount already available in your pocket.

We’ve already seen in [our article](https://blog.s-pro.io/invest-money-business-become-millionaire/) what options are there for you when your goal is to earn some interest. Even more, those methods over time can bring really inspiring results for everyone. [In this piece of work](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-invest-money-business/), I've concentrated more on the last specified option – business. There are many reasons for that. Probably the most important one is that business can bring the biggest revenue out of all other investment options.

## What are the most profitable businesses?

There are uncountable possibilities in every niche. Just check out the empty cells in the Startup Matrix we already described in [our post](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-brainstorm-new-startup-ideas-the-startup-idea-matrix/). We can start listing the actual spheres that are in need of fresh new ideas. But to be of more help to you we better concentrate on the directions in businesses that can be applied to almost every business niche.

What unites every other direction is technology. It has already changed the way all businesses function around the world. There more or less progress here or there, but it is definitely the biggest trend nowadays.

Entrepreneurs are stepping into the tech world with joy because it has already proven the positive effect that tech inclusions do with businesses by scaling them with ease.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning will take away manual operations transforming the way industries will work within just a few years.

### Online business

People are getting more aware of the benefits of online transactions, communication systems and other online platforms offer. Have you considered how much more convenient it is to use contactless payments?

There were many challenges that online businesses have already overcome and continue successfully dealing with nowadays.

### Artificial Intelligence

There have been many debates around AI for years. Nowadays it gets more and more popular and is expected to bring new products with [AI implemented](https://blog.s-pro.io/ai-driven-development-as-an-innovative-market-tendency/) in 2019 and further years.

With AI data analytics will be on hype as artificial intelligence operates with behavioral data of each user.

### Blockchain

Even though the hype around blockchain has been decreased lately, it still has great potential in [transforming all the business niches and everyone’s lives](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-change-the-world-for-the-better-or-our-utopian-future-with-blockchain/). Due to its benefits where the major ones are anonymity, security and interchangeability it has already been implemented in a number of big projects and continues to be in demand.

These are just a few major trends that will rule the business world and continue to be implemented in all areas of our lives. The core feature that unites all of them is an online presence. The mobility it gives to consumers is much appreciated by them. People are getting to feel the benefits of not be tied up to a certain location.

What comes to your mind when you think about mobility? Possibly mobile devices and the growing number of various mobile applications already implemented and growing. The thing is all the mentioned trends can be implemented in businesses via web and mobile applications.

**So without further ado, we are concluding that the most profitable businesses will be for sure connected with the** [apps developed to serve](https://s-pro.io/en/) **the described needs thus attracting more and more audience to any product you already have or only have in mind.**"

12,2019-06-12,NomadicAstronaut,6,Best way to invest money outside of the US?,"Hello Reddit.

**Intro**

I've received **$400,000 tax-free**, which I am unsure what to do with. I'm a **24 year-old dual US/EU citizen**, who moved from the US to Europe to do a PhD in AI/machine-learning. I don't plan on returning to the US permanently and I'm a bit weary about keeping money there. How can I invest this money outside of the US? And, should I?

**Lifestyle**

Evidently, I live a pretty frugal lifestyle; I've already been able to save \~$24,000 after 1.5 years on this meager PhD salary, even with extensive backpacking trips. Once the PhD is finished (age 26), I expect to get a research position in Europe, which I expect to pay ≥$110,000. I don't have any debt at all and I have excellent credit.

**Intentions**

I would like to invest this money somewhere and reinvest its returns, as I don't think I'd need this money for quite awhile, but I don't know where to start. I don't have any investment experience, except a $200 investment when I was 19 in a graphite company during Tesla's uprising, whose share prices have gone to $0 (fail). Mainly, I want this money to give me financial independence and security, as well as the possibility to do cool things like buying an AirBNB property in south France.

**Dilemma**

From what I understand, the US tax system is more conducive to making money than within the EU. But at the same time, the US taxes global income (if earning ≥$103,900), potentially hindering my life outside of the US and motivating me to renounce my citizenship in the future. How should I invest in this situation? Perhaps creating an off-shore company is the solution?

14,2019-07-27,EsteevTrabajos1,171,Stock picks and discussion for bulls and bears (7/29 - 8/2 trading week and beyond!),"Hey y'all!

I will be creating weekly posts (depending on the feedback) with a few stocks to keep on your watchlists for bulls and bears, and for short- and long- term investors. These posts are meant to start a discussion about **individual** stocks, their technicals and fundamentals. My ultimate goal with these posts is simply to share good DD. I believe in good karma and I think helping others succeed at trading translates to just better luck =). All of this comes after almost a decade investing in stocks and now with a PhD in statistics and machine learning skills in the bag. And no, I will never charge you or ask you to join any mailing list or discord. That's not how I roll (you can see my post history to verify this yourself!).

I'm of the idea that, **if accompanied by in-depth TA and FA**, investing on individual stocks has way more potential for profit than major indexes in the short-, medium- and long-terms. I generally focus on stocks that I know well, but please feel free to share your own DD on stocks you know well yourself.  With that said, here's a list of stocks to watch for bulls and bears for the trading week ahead, as well as in the long term. Again, these come from a combination of in-depth FA/TA. Let me know what your thoughts are below:

***If you're feeling bullish about the market this week (for traders AND investors)-***

* $BIIB; $OKTA; $MDB; $DIS; $TTD (I'd consider entry on Tuesday); $ROKU (DO NOT HOLD UNTIL EARNINGS!). These should all print some good tendies
* *Bullish power play:\*\** $CRWD, $GD, $CGC, $ALXN, $CRM, $AYX are all high risk/high reward potential plays
* *Bullish earnings plays:\*\*\** $ILMN (Mon AH); $AMGN (Tues AH); $TWLO, $HUM (Weds AH); $ETSY, $MPC (Thurs AH)

For those investing in the long term, I would recommend considering starting positions in any of these except $CGC, $CRM, $ROKU and $ILMN (these four are included only for options traders **for the week**).

***If you're feeling bearish about the market this week -***

* *Bearish:* $TIF; $CVNA; $IIPR; $PYPL (just for the week, bullish in the long term); $CWH
* *Bearish power play:\*\* $*NFLX; $LYFT; $SFX; $NKE; $PINS (will likely come down until earnings; bullish *for* earnings), 
* *Bearish earnings plays:\*\*\** $CHGG (Mon AH); $SIRI (Tues BO); $SHOP, $YETI (Thurs BO); $RACE (Fri BO)

For those investing in the long term, I would avoid/sell all of the above, except $PYPL, $IIPR, $SHOP and $CVNA. If you're holding $LYFT or $PINS stocks, keep holding!

**\*\*Keep in mind that EARNINGS PLAYS ARE RISKIER PLAYS, by default**

\*\*\*Power plays are also, in my books, a lot riskier/more uncertain than others listed

**Disclaimer:** What I share with you is the product of hours of research I do to build **my own daily stock watchlist**. I trade these stocks (not all, and especially not all at once) because I see (up or down) swing potential for the day/week/month. Of course, trade at your own discretion and use the stocks for your watchlist. If you're feeling confident and see some momentum, follow your &lt;3.

**These predictions are based on the expectation that we will have a quarter-point cut in interest rates, which is the most likely case scenario according to investors right now.**

15,2019-07-09,PJHFStocks,2,"Stock Pick- Monday, July 8 2019 (10:30PM) SHORT VERI","This is the first of many posts to keep track of my stock picks. I plan to post periodically so I can practice stock pitches in interviews. Please feel free to comment on my picks, as well as my rationale. I will provide full disclosure of my portfolio at the end of every post.

&amp;#x200B;

**SHORT:**

**Veritone (VERI)**

*Today's price $7.70 Today's movement -5.75% Market Cap (Yahoo Finance) $156.6M*

**Summary:** Veritone markets itself as an AI software company, but can be viewed more as a SAAS company. They provide services to M&amp;E (Media &amp; Entertainment), Government, and Legal &amp; Compliance. The AI component of their software comes from facial and item recognition. For instance, its AI can learn what a customer logo looks like and then show how many impressions of the logo appears in a video. Its AI can also, recognize a face in a surveillance video and identify the suspect.

Veritone can help its customers cut expenses via labor hours and provide a revenue stream because its AI edits videos. For M&amp;E, companies can charge customers the ability to find clips of a specific person in their content (for example an athlete in a sports event). In government, man-hours are saved because an official does not have to watch the whole surveillance video. The portion of the video without the perpetrator will be edited out.

I believe there is great value in Veritone's software, but I don't believe in Veritone's run rate. Veritone reminds me of another company, HMNY (owner of Moviepass). HMNY's stock like Veritone's skyrocketed in the beginning because of FOMO investors and large fanfare. HMNY was bleeding cash and sold equity to become cash positive. HMNY stock price suffered because of this. HMNY's stock price went so low it did a 1 for 250 reverse stock-split so it could continue to be listed on Nasdaq and raise cash at a higher stock price. HMNY's stock is now a penny stock.

I recommend short Veritone until it can prove to be cash flow positive from operations. Veritone can become cash flow positive because of tailwinds like new legislation in California, Ohio, and many other states forcing law enforcement to disclose a redacted version of their audio and video-based evidence on a far more rapid timeline. Until then, the cash burn and dilution will cause the share price to slide once again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts for Short**:

**1.** **Veritone will continue to issue common stock to be cash flow positive and dilute investors.**

Q4 2018 Shares outstanding was 19,335,220.

Veritone issued 662,000 common stock in Q1 2019 (3.4%)

Q1 2019 Shares outstanding was 20,197,188.

**2**. **Additional dilution, such as Acacia Research has 1.1 million warrants priced at $13.61 and acquisitions are being funded partially by equity.**

The warrants are not in the money yet. If Veritone's stock price does increase, Acacia will dilute current investors even further.

Veritone acquired three companies this past year. More information can be read in ""Recent Acquisitions"" far below.

**3. Not enough revenue growth to offset net loss**

Revenue was $12.1M, an increase of 177% vs Q1 2018. This according to the earnings call happened from acquisitions and organic growth. The acquisitions caused SG&amp;A to increase more too so the net loss was (16,306) vs (13,047) in Q1 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts for Potential Long:**

**1. Proof of repeat customers: ESPN and Golden Boy.**

**ESPN**

**2. Revenue growth opportunity with new legislation in California, Ohio, and other states**

Aforementioned, new legislation will force law enforcement to disclose a redacted version of their audio and video-based evidence on a far more rapid timeline. Veritone is primed to serve this market.

**3. Insider buying, strong management, and a strong board of directors**

CEO Chad Steelberg ($7.54/share), President Ryan Steelberg ($7.49/share), and Board Member Richard H. Taketa ($7.49/share) bought shares within the last month

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst for Long or Short (depending on outlook):**

**1. Rejected Apis Capital hostile takeover bid**

In December 2018, Apis Capital offered to acquire Veritone at $10.26/share, an 82% premium at that time. Apis Capital subsequently withdrew its bid. This can be viewed as management's competence or incompetence.

**Competent**

Management was competent and believed the 82% premium was too small. Management believes the share price can be above $10.26/share soon.

**Incompetent**

Management was incompetent and did not look out for shareholders as the stock price is well below that today.

&amp;#x200B;

**Recent Acquisitions (From 10-Q):**

**Acquired Performance Bridge (8.21.18)**

Veritone paid initial consideration of $5,158 and will pay a total of $3,909 in additional contingent earnout amounts for certain revenue milestones achieved by Performance Bridge in its 2018 fiscal year. The acquisition of Performance Bridge has expanded the Company’s media agency offerings of comprehensive podcast solutions.

**Acquired Wazee Digital (8.31.18)**

Veritone paid an aggregate purchase price of $12,552, comprised of $7,423 paid in cash and the issuance of a total of 491,157 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $5,129 based on the Company’s closing stock price on August 31, 2018.

The acquisition of Wazee Digital has expanded the Company’s offerings to include digital content management and licensing solutions.

**Acquired Machine Box (9.6.18)**

Veritone paid initial consideration of $1,484, and the Company may pay up to an additional $3,000 in contingent amounts if Machine Box achieves certain technical development and integration milestones within 12 months after the closing of the acquisition, a portion of which was paid in the first quarter of 2019.

In March 2019, the Company determined that Machine Box had achieved the technical development and integration milestones required to be completed as of March 6, 2019 and, as a result, the former Machine Box stockholders became entitled to receive an aggregate of $200 in cash and an aggregate of 135,583 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $880 based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on March 6, 2019.

Machine Box is a developer of state-of-the-art machine learning technologies, which have enhanced the Company’s aiWARE platform capabilities.

&amp;#x200B;

I am working on a personal project that uses machine learning to automatically execute trades based on several criteria. To train the program however, I need access to a paper trading program with current market data (I don't care if the data is delayed, but it needs to be accurate). I also need to be able to interact with this program through another program in real time (meaning I can direct the my program to purchase a particular number of shares and the paper trading program will execute the trade upon receiving the request).

The program that would be directing the trades within the paper trading program will be written in Python, but I can also write it in JavaScript or PHP (the order of those languages is my preference for using them). 

I am not against the idea of paying for this software, but obviously if I can find something that suits my needs for free, it would be ideal. If you have any questions or need clarification, please ask and I will try and respond promptly"

24,2019-10-08,fuzzyaces,18,Splunk Financials and Underlying Story,"Following my last post, I received a request to take a deeper dive into Splunk (SPLK), a rapidly growing company in the IT Operations Management (ITOM) space. 

One quick note before I kick off, I might reorganize these posts just to give them a bit more structure, which may evolve as time goes on.

**Industry**

Splunk fits within an interesting niche of the ITOM space. Their specialization is part of an area focused on machine learning and big data for logging, monitoring, and reporting IT Operations. To quote from [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/doc/3892967?ref=mrktg-srch) and [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/01/09/the-big-problem-with-big-data/#4d89199723b1), ""By 2022, 40% of all large enterprises will combine big data and machine learning functionality to support and partially replace monitoring, service desk and automation processes and tasks."" Given the upside, there are a ton of [vendors](https://blog.opsramp.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Blog_images/AIOps%20Vendor%20Landscape@2x-100.jpg?width=3840&amp;name=AIOps%20Vendor%20Landscape@2x-100.jpg) craming into a very crowded market. In [Gartner's](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3939625/market-share-analysis-itom-performance-analysis-software) most recent report, the market size is $5.2B and grew at 12% YoY, also [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190423005350/en/Splunk-Increases-Market-Share-Gartner’s-Performance-Analysis). 

**Revenue**

For Splunk, their (reported) revenue is broken down into 3 main categories: Licensing, Maintenance and Services, and Cloud. The License line is a one-time payment for a perpetual license for on-premise deployment of the Splunk Enterprise suite, while the maintenance and service and cloud license pay an annual subscription fee, which is tiered based on the amount of data ingested. Their revenue is rapidly transitioning from the perpetual license to the their annual subscription as they said in their most recent [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/22/splunk-inc-splk-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx) ""We expect the elimination of perpetual license sales will accelerate renewable mix to 99% in Q4 and high 90s for the full-year."" [seen here](https://imgur.com/CX7RqQ).

This transition has a bit of uncertainty around it. Exabeam, one of Splunk's competitors in the SIEM space, recently [mentioned](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2019/06/14/exabeams-fast-growth-not-slowing-down-splunk/#70e6bad1c36b) that customers are unable to predict their expenditure since Splunk prices based on data ingested, which can be a varying target. Additionally, the cloud transition provides a more sticky cash flow for the company, but will provide short-term pain since the amounts are billed annually vs. entirely upfront. While this might help customers from an initial expenditure outlay (potentially removing one of the roadblocks), it is the reason that Splunk recently revised their cash flow forecast from a positive $250mm inflow to a negative $300mm outflow (despite raising annual guidance from $2.25B to $2.3B). 

The critical KPI for the company here is their [Remaining Performance Obligations](https://investors.splunk.com/static-files/4333fe85-6fc8-40cc-b56d-60e4527281cb), which is non-cancellable (future) contracted revenue. In 2Q20, the RPO was [$1.235B](https://imgur.com/pr7Rxh7), with 61% of that to be recognized over the next twelve months ($753mm). The average contract duration for the contracts signed have hovered just shy of 3 years (33 months). One concerning metric in their most recent quarter was that the contract bookings slowed dramatically in the most recent quarter, $554mm, which is only a 19% growth rate.

Finally, Splunk just [closed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000141057819001502/tv530497_8k.htm) on their acquisition of SignalFX on October 1st, so guidance and RPO will likely look dramatically different in Q3 and Q4 as the company represents a combined platform.

**Costs**

From a cost perspective, the company's costs have stayed broadly consistent with [topline growth](https://imgur.com/hOrLe5P). On an LTM basis, the company has ~$1.8B of expenses, excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangibles. The number of employees has grown from 2,700, to 3,200, to 4,400, to 4,700 from Jan-2017, Jan-2018, to Jan-2019, and today respectively. Assuming an average total compensation of [$261,231](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1353283/000120677419001555/splk3465081-def14a.htm#CEOPayRatio), accounts for ~$1.15B of those expenses or ~72% for FY19. This has remained relatively constant for 2015 to current.

As a result, cloud margins are improving, as 2Q20 reached a 50% margin, nearing their 70% gross margin target. Research and Development has remained relatively constant at 15 - 17.5% of sales, sales and marketing at 45% - 50% of sales, and G&amp;A at ~10% of sales. These percentages strip out stock-based compensation, but since there is no breakdown, still include D&amp;A. 

**Capitalization**

Splunk is well funded with 2 convertible senior notes (convertible at $148.30) for a total debt of $2.1B, but has $2.7B in cash and investments. This gives the company a great war-chest to continue to acquire companies in the space. The company has acquired [7 companies](https://imgur.com/xW8hmli) in the past 2 years, with the most notable being SignalFX, augmenting their suite of products in the monitoring segment. 

**Returns**

Over the last 4 - 5 quarters, Splunk's return on capital has settled into the [5 - 10% range](https://imgur.com/hOrLe5P). Given their reinvestment rate of ~150% (math from [here on p 26](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/ovhds/dam2ed/growthandtermvalue.pdf)), this implies a sustainable EBIT growth rate of 7 - 10%. To me, this passes the smell test since it's broadly consistent with the industry growth predicted by IDC and Gartner, implying that Splunk's organic revenue growth will continue and acquisitions should provide further juice to the topline growth rate. 

**Outlook**

Splunk issued guidance of $2.3B for FY2020, with $600mm in Q3 (implying ~$760mm in Q4). Wall street is right in line with guidance for 2020, and showing $2.8B for 2021 (or a 22% growth rate). The challenge for the company will be to weather the transition from the upfront payment to the cloud subscriptions, since that will depress cash flow for the next year or two. The company even noted on their last [earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/08/22/splunk-inc-splk-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx) that their target cash flow yield won't be realized until after 2021.

TL;DR Splunk is a rapidly growing player in the IT Operations Management space that is growing dramatically and starting the shift into turning their revenue stream into longer-term contracts. As the company transitions, it will depress cash flow in the near-term, but could accelerate onboarding as it manages the initial expense outlay for customers.

25,2019-11-11,beck2047,1,Google’s ‘Project Nightingale’ Gathers Personal Health Data on Millions of Americans,"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790?mod=hp_lead_pos1) 

Google is engaged with one of the country’s largest health-care systems to collect and crunch the detailed personal health information of millions of Americans across 21 states.

The initiative, code-named “Project Nightingale,” appears to be the largest in a series of efforts by Silicon Valley giants to gain access to personal health data and establish a toehold in the massive health-care industry. [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also aggressively pushing into health care, though they haven’t yet struck deals of this scope.

Google began the effort in secret last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, the second-largest health system in the U.S., with the data sharing accelerating since summer, the documents show.

The data involved in Project Nightingale encompasses lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, including patient names and dates of birth.

Neither patients nor doctors have been notified. At least 150 Google employees already have access to much of the data on tens of millions of patients, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents.

Some Ascension employees have raised questions about the way the data is being collected and shared, both from a technological and ethical perspective, according to the people familiar with the project. But privacy experts said it appeared to be permissible under federal law. That law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, generally allows hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used “only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions.”

Google in this case is using the data, in part, to design new software, underpinned by advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, that zeroes in on individual patients to suggest changes to their care. Staffers across Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent, have access to the patient information, documents show, including some employees of Google Brain, a research science division credited with some of the company’s biggest breakthroughs.

In a press release issued after the Journal’s article was published, the companies said the project is compliant with federal health law and includes robust protections for patient data.

Tech giants like Amazon and Apple are expanding their businesses to include electronic health records -- which contain data on diagnoses, prescriptions and other medical information. That’s creating both opportunities and spurring privacy concerns. Here’s what to know. Photo Composite: Heather Seidel/ The Wall Street Journal

Google Cloud president Tariq Shaukat said in the release that the company’s goal in health care centers on “ultimately improving outcomes, reducing costs, and saving lives.”

“As the healthcare environment continues to rapidly evolve, we must transform to better meet the needs and expectations of those we serve as well as our own caregivers and healthcare providers,” said Eduardo Conrado, an executive vice president at Ascension.

Google and nonprofit Ascension have parallel financial motives. Google has assigned dozens of engineers to Project Nightingale so far, without charging for the work, because it hopes to use the framework to sell similar products to other health systems. Its end goal is to create an omnibus search tool to aggregate disparate patient data and host it all in one place, documents show.

The project is being developed under Google’s cloud division, which trails rivals like Amazon and Microsoft in market share. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said repeatedly this year that finding new areas of growth for cloud is a priority.

Ascension, a Catholic chain of 2,600 hospitals, doctors’ offices and other facilities, aims in part to improve patient care. It also hopes to mine data to identify additional tests that could be necessary or other ways in which the system could generate more revenue from patients, documents show. Ascension is also eager for a faster system than its existing decentralized electronic record-keeping network.

Google, like many of its Silicon Valley peers, has at times drawn criticism for not doing enough to protect user privacy. Its YouTube unit agreed in September to pay $170 million in fines and make changes to its practices in response to complaints that it illegally collected data on children to sell ads. YouTube neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google hid a flaw that exposed hundreds of thousands of birth dates, contact information and other personal data of subscribers in its now-defunct social-networking website Google Plus, in part because of fears that the incident could trigger regulatory scrutiny. Google said at the time it went beyond legal requirements in determining not to inform users."
26,2019-12-23,ScienceDave-RE,1,In dire need of fanatical management advice.,"First of all I want to start by saying I am genuinely not trying to make a brag post. I have no interest in what is typical for people’s personal portfolios but I am happy with my personal return on investment.

I have a background in computer science and I have put together a machine learning algorithm that’s takes in about 150 (and counting) data point, from historical data, current media, stock relationship trend etc applied to various stocks.

For the last 5 years, my portfolio has performed extremely well with my Sharpe Ratio ranging from low 2s to above 3.

I have quite a few friends and family members interested in having me trade their money for them, but I have no clue how to set up logistical parameters, or of the legality of doing this without a registered Hedge Fund or something similar.

I’m tempted to offer them something like an annuity, where participants would receive a guaranteed percentage return at a certain interval, and I would keep whatever I made beyond that.

The problem is, I have no clue how I could set something like this up and financial attorneys are expensive.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could do this?"

28,2019-12-08,LiveNeedleworker8,1,Is the recession over?,"If you had told people on this subreddit a year ago that we would be hitting all time highs and that SPY would be over 300 people would laugh at you. Yet this is exactly where we have gone. Despite retarded leadership America leads the pack and is dominating the world economically. Wages are rising, jobs are growing, and the stock market is doing better than ever. 

With that said, all the talk of recession a year or even months ago now seems silly. America will be victorious in the trade war because we have all the cards. And technology driven growth brought by AI and machine learning will further drive the economy. How could we possibly have a recession at this point? Do you guys really expect the stock market to go down? It seems the likelihood of recession now is now lower than ever. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have a real stock market pullback until 2030!"
