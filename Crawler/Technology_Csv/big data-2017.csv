0,2017-01-31,AmeyDandawate,85,Summary of “The Little Book That Beats The Market” by Joel Greenblatt,"Here’s a summary of the book, “The Little Book That Beats The Market” by Joel Greenblatt, a hedge fund manager, investor, writer and professor, most notably known for Magic Formula Investing - an investment strategy he outlines in this book

Right off the bat, Joel Greenblatt, the author let’s you know that most professional investors and money managers are not going to help you beat the market. You can try going with a money manager, but most of them are only trained to sell you a particular investment product. You can try going with a mutual fund, but trying to pick mutual funds that will outperform the market is like having a monkey throw darts on a list of stocks. It involves quite a bit of luck (also cleaning equipment if the monkey chooses to fling poop instead of darts). If you are one of those rich farts that uses gold bars as bookmarks, you can try going with a hedge fund but the 2-20 fee structure will kill your returns. And if you are a middle-income fart that uses regular bookmarks as bookmarks, you can try going with an index fund but they will only give you the market’s average return minus taxes and costs.

If you want to beat the market, you’re going to have to do it yourself. How can you do that? By finding out what companies are worth and then trying to buy them for less than that. And that’s the essence of value investing, bottled in one small sentence.

Sure, you can save your money by sticking it under a mattress. But it’s not going to grow. In fact, it’s going to lose value due to inflation. You can grow your money by sticking it in a bank. The bank will take your money and lend it to companies. The bank will give you a small interest rate and make coffins full of fat stacks in the process. Or you can bypass the bank and lend your money directly to companies by buying bonds, make those fat stacks yourself. Your money or investment will grow at a higher interest rate, but that also comes with a higher risk of losing your money. So what is a risk-free investment? Well, the safest investment in the world is the 10-Year Bond issued by the US Government. So any investment worth your time must give you a higher interest rate than the 10-Year US Bond. Since the interest rate on the 10-Year US Bond is what investors in the market are demanding for a risk-free investment, therefore it follows that an investment with risk must yield higher than that.

If you haven’t rage quit this window by now, you’re in luck. Because the author suggests that the best option to grow your money is buying shares in a company. This entitles you to a portion of that company’s future profits. As discussed, that portion must be higher than what you’d earn on a 10-Year US Bond. How on earth do you calculate that? Earnings Yield. 

Earnings Yield = Earnings Per Share / Market Price. 

The earnings yield of any investment must be more than the interest rate on the 10-Year US Bond. The book argues that companies with a high earnings yield are available for purchase at cheap prices relative to what they’re earning. In short, a high earnings yield gives you a bigger portion of the company’s profits at cheaper prices. Because of this, earnings yield is used as gauge of measuring if the company’s stock price is cheap or expensive. Higher the earnings yield, cheaper the company. But a company trading at cheap prices, doesn’t always stay that way because over the long term prices will rise to where they should be. And as prices rise, earnings yield will drop. Yield. Yield. That’s a very weird word if you keep repeating it over and over again. Yield.

Alright, now that we’ve established that, let’s go back to that small sentence. Finding out what companies are worth and then trying to buy them for less than that. But if you can find out what a company is worth, then so can your neighbour and the entire block, which makes it just a tinsy bit difficult to buy the company for less than that what it’s worth. Lucky for you, stock prices fluctuate wildly over short periods of time. However, the worth of the underlying company does not fluctuate as much. This provides you, your neighbour and indeed, the entire block with opportunities to buy shares at prices below the worth or value of the company and sell shares at prices above the value of the company. But having a big margin of safety is always better. A margin of safety is buying shares when they are trading at way, way below the value of the business. This is a good idea because at the end of the day, you’re only human. And as unfortunate as that sounds, it means that you will make errors and encounter unexpected scenarios that affect the underlying company. A margin of safety helps you mitigate that risk. Let’s take a moment to say thank you to the margin of safety, the unsung hero of investing. 

The stock market that fluctuates wildly over short periods of time is that same stock market that lusts after growth. It stares at growth in profits in very much the same way a broke college student stares at ready-to-eat noodles. And very much like the broke college student with his noodles, the stock market pounces on every company that shows consistent high growth in profits. But what leads to a high growth in profits? If you follow the book, it’s a high return on capital.

Return On Capital = (Net Income - Dividends) / (Equity + Debt)

The book argues that companies that earn a high return on capital have the opportunity to reinvest profits at a high rate of return. This leads to a high rate of growth. And you know what that means. That means the stock market falling over itself to throw money at the company’s stock. Companies with a high return on capital are also likely to have a special advantage of some kind that keeps competitors from destroying the ability to earn above-average profits. Higher the return on capital, better the company.

Now, here is where the book dives into the magic formula of investing. No, it doesn’t involve pulling bunnies out of a hat. And no, it doesn’t involve carrying around a never ending chain of handkerchiefs. However, it does involve buying good companies at bargain prices. What are good companies? Companies with a high return on capital. What are bargain prices? Companies with a high earnings yield. What do you get when you put those two things together? Magic. Or at the very least, market beating investment results.

To substantiate its claims, the book also offers some proof that the magic formula works. Consider the 3,500 largest publicly traded US companies. Rank these companies separately by return on capital and earnings yield. Combine these rankings. For example, a company with 32nd highest return on capital and 56th highest earnings yield would rank 88th (32+56) on the combined rankings. Over 1988-2004, owning a portfolio of 30 highest ranked stocks according to these combined rankings would’ve returned 30.8% per year whereas the S&amp;P 500 returned 12.4% per year. Those are some impressive numbers right there.

What the magic formula really does is that it ranks stocks in order of quality. Hence, it will continue to work so long as the market continues to offer stocks. And it doesn’t sound like the market is going to run out of stocks any time soon. This magic formula works for big as well as small companies, and doesn’t appear to be based on sheer luck or random chance. However, too much of a good thing can be bad. So let’s throw in some bad news. The magic formula only works over the long term. It underperforms the market once every four years. However, as the tables of data in the book corroborate, over a long term time horizon the magic formula certainly beats the market. 

By now, you should be asking, “If this new fangled formula is so good, why isn’t everyone already using it? Huh? Huh? Check-mate, mister wall street.” And even if you aren’t asking that, the book has an answer anyway. Most people will not stick to a strategy that will sometimes underperform the market. They will simply abandon the strategy. This is where the author drops the F-bomb. Faith. You need to have faith and truly believe that the magic formula will work - because it’s hard to not give up during the periods when the formula is underperforming the market. Usually, the animal instincts tend to take over and kick all rational argument overboard.

The author also tells you to give back to society and do good, now that you’re going to be all rich and famous. But you probably already have a laundry list of things to do, ready to go for when you become rich and famous. Let’s end this summary with a quote from the author - “Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you’re looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you’re still an idiot.”

Pro Tip - Don’t be an idiot."

3,2017-01-30,deevan11,4,Tracking Stock Thinking,"Hello!
After a year, I still have a need for [this!](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/3cipge/how_do_you_track_your_thoughts_and_decisions_on/) and want to ask for your help. 

I thought about why I want it. 

I read about stocks. I like to read about them and sometimes they interest me enough to buy, and sometimes I don’t buy, but I decide to wait and check it out in a few months. For example, there may be a new technology, or drug, or permit catalyst. The articles I read can front-run a catalyst a lot.
Example
- X company will release a product by mid-2017. my response: “Well why not wait until then? The stock might even get lower in the meantime”
- Phase 2 is promising. “sometimes there’s a big pop on a successful phase 2 and then a selloff. Wait until after this selloff”

There’s a separate concept of catalyst and efficient market. But people can misjudge the risk and pay early for something. 

Concepts
- Nasim Taleb talks about neomania. Similar concept. Wait, let the idea mature, and then see how your mind has changed. 
- “What I learned losing a Million Dollars” - put your stop point ahead of time
- The idea of reflection and learning. Write down “What was I thinking at the time”

Long term I see the site as
- having thousands of people contributing their expectations, buy points, and sharing this with the users. Aggregate data points can be useful. 

I see the minimum viable product as a browser extension which, when you read an article with a stock, you;
click a button on the browser.
- it clips the URL
- asks you the ticker
- suggest you the buy price (lower than current price)
- reminds you in 3 months of the current price of the stock OR sends you an email if your buy price is hit. 

It’s like a RemindMe bot for Reddit but you can use it on any website. 

Feedback. Would anyone use it?

Smart driving cars rely on constant communication with datacenters.

Smart gadgets are only smart if they can info back and forth from remote servers in datacenters.

5G wireless bandwidth increase is for ioT and gadgets talking to the cloud... well the cloud is in fact datacenters.

It seems the corner stone of all the tech displayed at CES is datacenters with seemingly infinite bandwidth and processing power.

Yet I've seen very little mention in the press about data centers. After all the ""C"" in CES stands for ""Consumer"". Consumers don't see data centers.

But I'm trying to take a step back and look at the big picture. if anyone is going to profit from these new techs, it's Data Center REITs, right?

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: 

an NFL team is building ​state-of-the-art new digs,
outclassing the other 31 with bold architecture and whiz-bang digital scoreboards massive enough to render the actual playing field into a distracting sideshow. The team solicits taxpayer funding by projecting how the venue will reinvigorate the local economy. How could you say no? It’s a matter
of local pride to be the biggest and best; now it’s apparently profitable to boot.

Except by the time the project’s shovel-ready, the stadium’s already been eclipsed by another two in
the works - one by a bitter division rival, no less. Fast-forward a decade or three, and all of a sudden home field is looking pretty sad and worn down. The team freshens up its now-vintage
pitchbook and sticks out an oversized mascot paw for more bond money…

//

I’m the sort of investor who isn’t terribly popular at dinner parties, on the rare occasion I end up at
them, because everyone’s first question is ​“oh, where do you think ​ the market’s going?” Naturally,
I reply with the standard bottom-up value-oriented line: ​“you know, I really don’t have any useful
thoughts on the market, but I could tell you about this awesome new product from my favorite
corporate training company that totally changes how Chief Learning Officers create impact
journeys for...” Lo and behold, I look up, and they’ve abandoned me for the lobster samosas,
leaving me to drown my unfinished sentence in a cold Coca-Cola.

Nonetheless, while I focus on picking strong swimmers rather than predicting the tide, one
potential mistake that can be made when deeply analyzing individual opportunities (in addition to
over-reliance on ​exhaustive data collection rather than thoughtful decision making) is to get so
wrapped up in company-specific details that you overlook the broader systemic context - the “and
then what?” analytical step out of the reductionistically precise comfort of a spreadsheet into the
messy, complex real world.

Here’s a quick example of how you could be lulled into a false sense of bottom-up security that
conflicts with fairly obvious system-level issues. This time last year, for reasons I can’t quite
remember, I actually spent a little bit of time working on brick-and-mortar retailers. (I know, I
know - not one of my better time allocation decisions.) 

The first one I looked at had an interesting
story: for what management assured investors were fully controllable reasons around product
assortment, the comp stack didn’t look super, but they had a magic plan: ​investing in e-commerce,
reducing time-to-market to emulate fast-fashion peers, and implementing new real-time data
systems to target customers and “chase” hot products flying off the shelves.

Oh cool - that seems like a reasonable strategy. Or at least it did, until I looked at retailers #2, 3,
and 4… and discovered that, whether due to social proof or some other factor, they were all taking
pretty much the same approach.

My mind automatically jumped to the system level - unit-wise, the apparel TAM is more or less a
zero-sum pie, insofar as anyone not named “Dez Bryant” or “your wife” is only going to buy ​so
many pairs of ​ shoes between now and next Christmas. ( ​So, so many.) Quips aside, retail’s
obviously a mature market where achieving robust growth necessitates either differentiated
product to the extent of pricing power, or stealing volume from competitors. 

Mathematically, share gains by LULU/Gildan/etc necessitate commensurate share losses by Levi’s/Hanes/etc.
Implementing real-time sales tracking, a more robust e-commerce platform, and a supply chain
with shorter lead times certainly seems like a valid competitive strategy with a reasonable shot at
success… until you figure out all your competitors are pursuing the same approach, which means,
on net, any one player will achieve zero incremental competitive advantage.

With another year in the books, my suspicions were confirmed - new data systems couldn’t salvage
comps for any of those sad-sack retailers. Admittedly you can’t blame retail executives for trying;
after all, if they didn’t make those moves, they might be holding their next earnings call on their
way up the steps of bankruptcy court. However, investors blinded by “cheap” valuation metrics,
hoping for improving comps and margins, should’ve known better. 

Value trap 101. Of course, I’m not breaking any new intellectual ground here - this is exactly why Buffett stopped
buying cigar butts with no competitive advantage. Keeping with the apparel theme, here is a pithy
explanation from Charlie Munger:

*“[in a commodity industry], all the advantages from great improvements [will] flow through to the
customers. The people who sell the machinery - and by and large, even the internal bureaucrats
urging you to buy the equipment - show you projections with the amount you’ll save at current
prices with the new technology. However, they don’t do the second step of the analysis - which is to
determine how much [will] stay home and how much [will] just flow through to the customer.

I’ve never seen a single projection incorporating that second step in my life. And I see [such
projections] all the time. Rather, they always read: “This capital outlay will save you so much
money that it will pay for itself in three years.”*

So you keep buying things that will pay for themselves in three years. And after 20 years of doing it, somehow you’ve earned a return of only about 4% per annum. That’s the textile business.” 

A third and final example, coincidentally also retail-related, is the bull thesis on Seritage Growth
Properties (SRG) - i.e. slicing up and redeveloping erstwhile Sears boxes at substantially higher
rental rates.

I’ve seen multiple detailed writeups, none of which addressed my basic system-level
question: ​which tenants can generate sustainable profits in B/C space? Fellow big-box anchor
J.C. Penney has issues, the venerable Macy’s is slashing jobs, and I don’t think new Barnes and
Nobles are in the cards.

The long list of smaller-format retailers that have gone from “hot” to “not”
includes, but is not “ ​Limited ​” to: Hot Topic, Quiksilver, Aeropostale, J. Crew, Express, and
essentially all of Ascena’s brands. Even cleats and clubs aren’t safe: Sports Authority went so
bankrupt that creditors chose to liquidate. 6 And it’s not as if these stores are closing into a
supply-constrained market - Jones Lang LaSalle notes the U.S. has as much retail space per capita
as “ ​France, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Germany combined.”

None of this is to say that Seritage couldn’t work. But imaginably, the counterparty (Simon?) to
those other downsizing retailers’ leases probably also wants to redevelop space… implying what for
pricing and utilization in an oversupplied market with shrinking demand? This system-level view
raises critical questions I consider “too hard” - i.e. unknowable and/or unpredictable. So I passed
Seritage by in favor of a much more clearly underpriced REIT I actually had an angle on. (A small
position and not my favorite idea, but in an expensive market, I’ll take value where I can find it.)


//

Most of the time, systems thinking helps you avoid dangerous pitfalls - take the standard B-school
example of terminal growth rates - if you assume a business will grow at 20% forever, ​you’re gonna
have a bad time, because SnackApp can’t be bigger than global GDP in 2035, it just can’t, I don’t
care how many selfies your cousin’s cat is sharing on it. Math says no. At a more sophisticated
level, incorporating systems thinking can help bottom-up value investors mesh deep business
understanding with the broader industry and customer context to obtain a more reasonable,
realistic set of expectations for how business performance will evolve over time.

That said, sharp thinkers reading between the lines of my first two examples might also spot a
categorically attractive fishing pond for potential ideas. I came close with one line on the second
page, but didn’t explicitly spell it out, because where would be the fun in that? ​If you’re up for

Obvious one: Any company relying on streaming. Additional tariffs to carry their data will have to be passed on to the customer adjusting demand for those services downward.

But at the same time free competition for eyeballs will decrease. Currently free services that allow free upload or peer to peer sharing of high bandwidth user generated content will have to scale back because they too will be forced to pay ISPs to carry that traffic. Massive tarriffing by ISPs will create an environment where a few large players can be the only winners.

#Macroeconomics: 

**Beginner** 

Any current intro to macro textbook.  It's best to stick to a university level intro book here because most of those won't try to push any sort of agenda.

**Intermediate**

Read up on money and banking. The standard textbook is Fredric Miskin (again get the latest edition). I thought the book was dry as dust (sorry Rick!) but it does go through the basics. If you are a serious investor you need to inoculate yourself against all the fairy tales from Austrians/bitcoiners/gold bugs/FED-haters generally that are floating around on the internet.

Another really great book is David Moss ""Macroeconomics."" It's a very concise book that he uses at Harvard b-school to give an overview to MBAs. It's actually more basic than a textbook like Blanchard, but it's so short and well-organized that it will give you the big picture AFTER you been immersed in the details.

Ed Leamer's ""Macroeconomic Patterns and Stories"" cannot be recommended enough for investors. He is a serious econometrician, but here he emphasizes the importance of ""Pictures, Words, and Numbers: In that order."" The book is all about forecasting the business cycle and gets you thinking about wrestling with the data. His examples are mostly US based (a large fairly closed economy) so you'll need to keep that in mind when you consider small open economies (like say the Netherlands).

Read Carlin and Soskice ""Macroeonomics"" - again the latest edition. So why another macro book? It doesn't hurt to look at things from a (slightly) different perspective. The explanation of the New Keynesian 3-equation model in the book is among the best. Go find the syllabus used at Oxford for their undergrad macro course to get some supplemental materials and essay topics.

**ADVANCED**

Read all the reports and releases that come from the main central banks (Fed, ECB, BoJ, BoE). This is indispensable for being a macro investor. Don't rely only on the summarized, filtered version from the news. You want to get inside the head of Yellen, Draghi, Kuroda, and Carney and the rest of the people on the monetary policy committees. How are they interpreting the news, what mental and formal models are they using, where do they disagree? Modern central banking has moved toward policy transparency so investors need to be well-calibrated to what is being said and follow their lead in many cases.

Get a book on economic indicators. There a few standard ones somewhat skewed to the US audience. Goldman Sachs at least in the past, puts out guides to macro releases. Don't worry if you can't get your hands on these, just go to the relevant government agency website and there will be more details than you could ever want. Of course, it will take experience to understand how markets react to the different macro announcements.

Get up to speed on market-based indicators. These will tend to be the most up-to-date, forward looking indicators since they are based on traded financial instruments. An example is Fed funds futures from which you can extract the market's expectation of a rate change. There are lots of traded instruments that will give you insight into what the market thinks is going on for interest rates, inflation, etc. Options on equity indices will also give you information. If you need some background, get Hull's excellent introductory book on options.

Read the article on money creation from the Bank of England. Resident mod (and I hear also a very good cook in real life) /u/MasterCookSwag

often provides this link in this sub when battling the above mentioned goldbugs, bit coiners and other loonies. You'll find that it is additive even after you've read Mishkin.

Read the book ""Economic Policy"" by Bénassy-Quéré, Coeuré, Jacquet, and Pisani-Ferry. This book is written by a group of academics/policymakers and ties policymaking to economic theory. It's not very technical, but covers a lot of ground and is very applied. It will help you understand what people at central banks and finance ministries are thinking about.

Finally, lest you think you know it all at this point, check out Uribe and Schmitt-Grohe's forthcoming book ""Open Economy Macroeconomics,"" a draft manuscript of which is available for free here. The website also has lectures slides, computer code, and data so that you can really learn the material. Unfortunately, unless you are technically (i.e. mathematically) well-trained just reading the previous books in this list will not prepare you for this book since serious macro requires a lot more than curve-shifting. (Curve shifting is enough to be a very good investor, but if you want to know what the experts are talking about, you need to go beyond. But go in with your eyes open and read Romer's recent essay on the state of affairs.)

If necessary (for example to understand the Uribe book), take a step back and learn some of the technical foundations. Read David Romer's ""Advanced Macroeconomics"" and work through the superb programming exercises at Tom Sargent and John Stachurski's online course at Quantitative Economics, which can be done in Python or Julia. If you need to take another step back, read Stachurski's recent book ""A Primer in Econometric Theory"" for a gentle introduction to probability and estimation.

16,2017-04-16,HeavenEdit,39,"What are things you can do to increase the likelihood of finding the next Google, Microsoft, Apple etc. ?","I (and probably many other people) like to daydream about having invested in some of these super popular companies or even in Bitcoin thinking about the humongous gains that could have been made. 

However it's very likely that there will be new opportunities for very profitable investments that people might not even see yet. People are talking about big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence and are throwing all kinds of buzzwords around saying that they will be the next *big* thing. I think so too.

For AI and self-driving cars there are lots of companies that one can invest in. Big players like Google are likely to have a big impact there. 

However for *huge* returns you will need to spot an emerging super high growth market that not a lot of people see coming yet and a company perfectly suited for it.

How would you go about making bets on such companies? Search through OTC / penny stocks and find something you think looks like a gem and **hold it for a couple of decades** (after you get through all of the scammers first) ? "
17,2017-04-15,abaabe10,18,(My first) DD on $NVDA,"Please give me feedback on my DD, and the formatting. I will try to implement ""fixes"" on this post.   
    
&amp;nbsp;
     
General Information:   
*P/E Ratio 38.05   
*Div Yield 0.59   
*Market Cap 56.30B   
*Institutional Ownership 75%   
     
&amp;nbsp;
     
P/E Ratio:   
A few interesting things to consider here are:   
Q1 2015 P/E Ratio ~18   
Q1 2017 P/E Ratio ~ 42    
Also note the fact that in Q1 2015 the stock cost only $20.    
     
In my opinion NVDA is not overvalued at all. Every single segment is more than likely going to grow (more on that later). When you compare NVDA to other tech growth stocks a P/E of 38 doesn't seem so high anymore.    
For example: ANET 52, SKY 61, and then there are players like TSLA that don't even have income. NVDA is the top growth stock for a reason.
    
&amp;nbsp;
    
Institutional Ownership:   
An interesting thing to keep an eye on is that on March 31, 2016 institutional ownership was at a high of 90.72%. Which shows that quite a bit of institutions jumped ship, but the shares were picked up by non-institutional owners. However, 75% is still a quite high ownership when compared to AMD, INTC and others. **I am a bit worried that the drop we are seeing right now is a result of more institutions jumping ship.**    

&amp;nbsp;
    

Now getting to the actual interesting part:   
My DD on Q1 2018 earnings:   
    
&amp;nbsp;
    
This is an important [slide](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-1XAJD4/4285688894x0x927425/01843210-E2B4-4E1F-938E-17F33C305078/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q417.pdf) to estimate future growth:   
One thing to note is that the gaming segment is historically very weak in the first quarter.    
    
&amp;nbsp;
    
Gaming:  
[Sources](http://investorplace.com/2017/04/analysts-nvidia-corporation-nvda-stock/2/#.WPJs-ojyuUk) are saying that this quarters gpu sales are down 15%, which is 10% more than in the past. This sounds bad, but one has to remember that 15% down from a record $1,348M income is still a shit-load of money. That results in an income of $1,146M, which is still in line with NVDA's estimated revenue for this quarter. On the other side of things, the 1080TI sales are estimated to be quite high. Additionally, it seems that NVDA has picked up quite a bit of market [share](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey) from its competitors.
   
&amp;nbsp;
    
Professional Virtualization:   
I don't have too much to say about this segment, but I am sure that it will bring in over $200M in revenue.   
    
&amp;nbsp;  
    
Data center:   
This segment seems to be exploding. NVDA's revenue trippled year over year, and it doesn't seem to slow down. If you look at the rest of the market, you will come to the same conclusion. I would be surprised if revenue was below $300M.   
    
&amp;nbsp;
    
Auto:   
Tesla recently broke out, because they finally got their production up. Additionally, their pre-orders are not stopping. This translates 1:1 into NVDA's revenue. NVDA currently has over 50 automated driving partners. I wouldn't be surprised to see a beat up to $175M, but since I like to be conservative I will say $140M.   
     
&amp;nbsp;
    
Lastly we have OEM &amp; IP, which seems to be the least interesting segment. It has been declining for some time now. Maybe I am missing something here, but I don't think so. We are still going to see a solid $150M of revenue in this segment.     
     
&amp;nbsp;
     
Now one last thing are the switch sales. The sales were [reported](https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/14/superdata-nintendo-sells-2-4-million-switch-consoles-worldwide-in-first-month/) to be 2.4 Million units in its first month. That *could* translate into more than $100M in Q1 revenue assuming Nintendo had kept their inventory at JIT levels.  
Edit on this: Actually NVDA's Q1 ends on May 1, which means it is quite likely that Switch will reach 3 Million by that point. We might see more than $150M in revenue from the Switch.    
   
&amp;nbsp;
    
**Finally, if we add up all the segment we are well above the estimated $1.9B in revenue.** I think that even if we ""only"" reach the estimated 1.9B we will go back up from the current $95 per share to at least $105. A beat might create a second Q3 2016 (maybe not that big haha).   "
18,2017-04-12,SillySausage87,8,2017: NVDA vs AMZN,"Nvidia had an incredible 2016. After a healthy pullback now, it is closer to fair value. It has incredible potential ahead. I am particularly excited about the data center side of the business, but there are so many exciting applications here. Its CEO is excellent.

Amazon gets better year after year. According to analysts, it's trading below fair value. It's cloud business is exciting, not to mention the fact it dominates e-commerce. One of the best CEOs the world has seen.

I feel that both companies have huge long term growth potential, however Amazon is probably more secure and stable with its wide moat. Nvidia may grow big in the long run, or maybe not - it's a bit too early to tell.

Both have earnings releases coming up soon. I think Amazon will grow in the short term no matter what. Nvidia, on the other hand, could drop 10% even if it reports ""respectable"" earnings.

So, what are your thoughts?

20,2017-04-05,dominodanger,13,Value+Momentum Global Country Index Ranker Spreadsheet w/Adjustable Factor Weights,"I recently created a spreadsheet with the goal of determining the best country indices to invest in based various criteria. The spreadsheet allows you to adjust the weighting of several factors which then adjust the projected returns and the rank of the country indexes/ETFs. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nehftXWncFlUg1Z_MY1AwXtQRc_CoOj26gaE2bxsS8A/edit?usp=sharing

The way the sheet is set up currently, the projected returns column is distributed based on the returns distribution over a 10-15 year period following a given CAPE value (using data from a Star Capital study.) This means that if you aren't giving the CAPE values a high weight, these projections become less useful, but still work as rankings. The expense ratio of a corresponding country index ETF is subtracted from the returns value. 

The sheet is definitely still rough around the edges. Some supporting and/or related data is shown in additional tabs. Let me know if you have ideas for improvements or for how the results should be applied or if you have questions.

**Tl;dr: Check out my google spreadsheet tool, ask questions here or add comments to the sheet, and make a copy so you can mess with the weighting of the various factors!**

Edit: A big reason for creating this sheet was to experiment with the affect of normalizing various metrics to the same standard deviation and mean before combining them together, rather than just using a average of the raw values or an average of rankings (like I've seen from Meb Faber). My thinking is that this will prevent the varying ranges and magnitudes of the values from screwing things up, but preserve the relative magnitudes of the differences between values. Hopefully I explained that in a way that makes sense. Any thoughts on the merits of this approach?"
21,2017-04-04,barefooter,0,Why I'm so incredibly bullish about Tesla,"I ended up making this long post below as a comment in one of the recent Tesla threads, but I figured it was deserving of its own post. Here's a summary of the reasons I'm super bullish on Tesla.

&amp;nbsp;

**Betting on Elon Musk**

Betting on someone like Elon Musk is potentially incredibly profitable. To build a company that will succeed as I believe Tesla will, you need the boldest, most visionary, brilliant leader you can find, and no one compares to Elon Musk. I loved Steve Jobs, but I think Musk has a huge edge on even him. Literally every company he's run has destroyed its market. It's his track record of being able to foresee the future and build companies around dominating a future market, rather than the current market. Take his first venture Zip2 for example, that market didn't even exist at the time, and he built it from scratch. Then X.com, which later became paypal. Again, he built a company in a market that barely existed, he created the market, and paypal is enormous now.


Again, with SpaceX, people laughed at him thinking he was doing the impossible, but look at what they're doing now. And for Tesla to come as far as it has in this amount of time, and for their cars to have gotten such high praise, it's just mind boggling. Elon Musk is the real deal, the kind of visionary with a coupled insane work ethic and ability to deliver on outlandish promises. If there's anyone to bet on, it's him.


Because of Musk's cult like following, they can hire the brightest engineers, and work them exceptionally hard. Not too different from Apple here. People literally want to go work their asses off for this guy so they can build the future. I'm a software engineer, and I HATE working hard, but I tried very hard (and failed) to get a job at SpaceX, because I wanted to work my ass off and change the world.

&amp;nbsp;

**The SpaceX synergy**

I think many investors overlook the SpaceX synergy with Tesla. Sure, they're building wildly different products, but they're still both manufacturing cutting edge technological machines. Lessons learned from either company can be transferred between the two. Also brilliant engineers can go between the two companies. This creates a serious multiplying force for both companies.

&amp;nbsp;

**Company Culture**

Tesla's company culture is built from the ground up to be highly innovative, fast moving, and completely dominate the future market. Sure, GM, Ford, etc. can and will start making more EVs, but their companies are not built for the future. They're built for the past, and the old ways of doing things are quickly going to become a liability. Tesla is a manufacturing company, but they have learned a lot of lessons from Silicon Valley tech companies and employ similar strategies of flatter hierarchy, which boosts ground up innovation, and quick iterative engineering practices.

&amp;nbsp;

**Product Quality**

It doesn't matter right now. They're reliable enough for early adopters, and early adopters don't care that much about reliability. This is evidenced in polls about owner satisfaction which rank very high. Building a car company from scratch, it takes many years to work out all the issues, and I have no doubt quality will be greatly improved on with the model 3 as production is greatly scaled up and they apply changes to manufacturing from lessons learned.

&amp;nbsp;

**But, but, but profits...**

Telsa would have to be stupid to take profits now, or for that matter anytime in the next 10 years! They are not building a company for the current market, they are building a company for the future market, and that requires reinvesting 100% into growth and R&amp;D. This is why the other auto makers will not be able to keep up. Sure, they'll be making EVs, but they simply cannot commit even a fraction of the capital into growing into the future. Whereas this is Tesla's entire purpose.

&amp;nbsp;

**The iPhone moment**

I, and many others, think Tesla is going to have an iPhone like moment, and potentially with the model 3. Where they release a car that is so compelling there would be no reason to buy another car in the same price range. This will spur huge interest into EVs from the general public, and Tesla will be poised to grow into that market, as they've been anticipating. Whereas other car makers will be left scrambling as they are barely making any EVs and will not be able to ramp production to meet demand.

&amp;nbsp;

**Optimizing Manufactoring**

Did you watch the talk Elon Musk and JB Straubel gave at the gigafactory opening? It literally gave me chills. Musk was talking about how they designed the factory, how it's like a multilayer CPU, and all this stuff about how they're basically reinventing automated manufacturing. They are not beholden to doing things the way they have always been done, they are dropping all that technological debt and building things from the ground up to be as efficient and automated as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

**First principles thinking**

Musk loves what he calls first principles thinking, where he breaks something down into the most basic physical properties, and tries to figure out what the floor of cost is for a product. SpaceX and Tesla are built around this way of thinking, and because of this, they can literally do the impossible. Musk thinks from the ground up. Rather than just making a slight improvement to something, he wants to figure out what are the limits of physics on producing a good. So if you're making a battery, you need X materials at Y mining cost, so the minimum cost is the raw materials, so how do you create a finished product for as close to this minimum as possible? It's literally striving for the impossible, but in this striving they are able to cut the price by a ridiculous margin. This is a big part of the SpaceX, Tesla secret sauce. Other manufactures might look at a product and say, well X company makes it for this price, lets produce it for 10% less and dominate the market. But Musk is literally going from the ground up, thinking if this was 100% optimized from mineral extraction to final sale, what would it cost, now lets work our asses off to get as close to that number as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

**Amazon was not just a book seller, Tesla is not just a car maker**

Many ""smart"" investors missed the boat on making huge returns on amazon, because they labeled them a book seller, and tried to traditionally value the company as such. If you had paid attention to what Bezos was saying back then and the course he was plotting, it would have been clear that he was building a company to dominate the then emerging online marketplace. If you believed at the time those markets would be huge, it would have been a very smart investment. I think you can see the parallel with Tesla, they are not just another car company. They are building a company to dominate the emerging EV, solar, and electricity storage markets. If you think those markets will be huge, and think Tesla has a good chance to take a big chunk of the market, then it's a very wise investment.

&amp;nbsp;

**The future will be electric**

In my mind, this is a done deal. You can look at the trends, solar prices have been plummeting for years, batteries are getting cheaper and better, etc. We are quickly nearing a tipping point. Sure, there are dinosaurs like Trump that want to bring back coal, but the market has spoken already and renewables are going to become so cost effective that agenda won't matter. So, if the future is destined to be electric, what is the valuation of a company that has vertical integration of the key products of this future, solar panels, batteries, and EVs?

&amp;nbsp;

**The future will be automated**

Tesla has been criticized for putting out ""beta"" software for self driving, but this is a strategic part of their plan. The current trend in AI, and what's working very well in many disciplines (ie: deepmind) is getting massive datasets to train multi layer machine learning algorithms. This is Tesla's plan. They are getting immense amounts of data currently, while the other players sit on their hands and try to design the ultimate self driving car before releasing it. It's not possible, you need the millions of miles of training data, and Tesla alone will have this. This is why they are not using LIDAR, because they understand the training dataset is the real asset, and they can acquire that data much more quickly by getting as many cars on the road with cameras as quickly as possible. I expect the quality of the self driving AI will begin getting better at an exponential rate in the next year or two, and those other auto makers that are building AI behind closed doors will be left in the dust, maybe even wanting to license the tech from Tesla.

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR**

Yeah, I have a huge hard on for Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX, but it's justified because he's proven time and time again that he's capable of achieving the impossible. Tesla is designed to completely dominate the future car and energy markets, and the existing companies simply won't be able to keep pace because they were designed to dominate a market that will be antiquated within 10 years. The future will be electric, and Tesla is poised to take a large chunk of an immense industry, so future 1 trillion valuations are not outlandish. For all I know the stock price is overvalued right now and may drop a good deal, but I'm investing in the long term vision and would rather not take a chance on missing a dip that may never happen."
22,2017-04-02,InterestingNews1,0,Earnings news this week,"I find the main press report the same old stories on big names  even if there is not alot to talk about.  I prefer to dig deeper and find stories about smaller companies who are making big changes.  A few stories are provided below.  Please let me know what you think -- good and bad.

Dollarama (TSE:DOL), Canada's biggest dollar store chain, beat expectations with a 24% increase in EPS, 11.5% increase in sales and 5.8% increase in same store sales.  Q4 EPS was $1.24 compared to $1.00 last year and forecasts of $1.12.

With 1,095 locations Dollarama is the biggest dollar store chain in a country with significantly lower penetration than the US.  In March 2017, the Corporation completed a study to re-evaluate the market potential for Dollarama stores across Canada. The study took into consideration the 2016 census and household income data, the current competitive retail landscape, the rates of per capita store penetration, the performance of comparable and new stores and the targeted payback period expected by Dollarama on new store openings.

Having completed the study the company has announced plans to expand the store network beyond the previously disclosed threshold of 1,400 stores, up to approximately 1,700 stores over the next eight to ten years. While cannibalization is expected to increase as the total store count gets closer to 1,700, management does not expect this to have a significant impact on the current average capital payback period of approximately two years.

The decision shows that there is a huge runway of growth for both profits and earnings for the company.  The stock price has risen 10% to $110.21 on a valuation of 32 times trailing earnings but with huge forcast growth in store numbers and comparative sales it still looks like a bargain.



 

Restoration Hardware (RH) is up 18% since reporting its earnings beat and rosy guidance on Tuesday.  Revenue fell 9% to $587 million beating consensus forecast for $585 million and net income fell to $27.9 million or $0.68 which beat expectations of $0.66.

CEO Gary Friedman said ""Exiting fiscal 2016 we are now through the most uncertain stages of our transformation."" and went on to add ""2016 was a year of transformation and transition at RH. We transformed our business from a promotional to a membership model that we believe will enhance our brand, streamline our operations, and vastly improve the customer experience.""

However it was RH's guidance that drove the stock price increase. The company expects revenue to jump by 8% to 12% from year-ago levels, operating margins to expand, and to generate significant free cash flow in fiscal 2017.  Adjusted earnings for the year are forecast to increase 26% to 55% to between $1.78 and $2.19 per share.

The stock price is now up over 80% from 52 week lows at $45.  But with RH now positioned to profit from a buoyant housing market it could have further to go.

Carnival (CCL) beat expectations and raised guidance on Tuesday after saying bookings were ""well ahead"" of last year at ""considerably higher prices"".  The profit for the quarter rose to $352m (or $0.48 EPS) from $142m ($0.18 EPS) as the company benefited from increased passenger numbers, increased passenger spend and the non-recurrence of derivative losses.

The company raised full year 2017 EPS guidance to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.70 (up from December guidance of $3.30 to $3.60).

""We are off to a good start delivering another quarter of operational improvement on top of a very strong first quarter last year."", said  Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald.  ""Our performance was driven by increased demand, particularly for our core Caribbean itineraries, leading to higher year-over-year ticket prices which enabled us to overcome the significant negative impact of both fuel and currency to exceed the high end of our guidance range.""

Carnival has seen earnings grow by 33% annually over the past five years as the demand for quality cruises has exploded --boosted by emerging markets, an ageing population and better services.  Priced at $58.96 the stock is up 37% this year.  However on a PE of 15.7 it is still on a significant discount to the market and given its growth prospects still looks cheap.

Just my opinion.  This is not a recommendation to buy or sell.  Please do your own research."
23,2017-05-29,urbanachiever77,8,Big data as the next battleground for investing,"The following is an article from BI. Anyone else knowledgeable on the subject? 

(See original article for some coinciding charts: From here: http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-future-of-investing-and-you-probably-cant-afford-it-2017-5)

Big money investors have always sought an edge. Everything from star traders to fast computers to unique analysis can give a big hedge fund an advantage over competitors. The latest battleground is data.

Investors are vying for new data sets that their competitors don't have, or haven't thought of using. These can range from the basic credit-card sales information to satellite data that tracks shipping routes, and parsing this kind of data for trading signals has been called ""the future of investing.""

The industry providing this to the funds has sprung up amid an explosion in obtainable data over the past decade. The bad news for the regular investor: the cost of data, and the complexity associated with turning it into investment insights, means it will probably only be available to the biggest and most sophisticated funds. 

At JPMorgan's macro quantitative and derivatives conference on May 19, the bank surveyed 237 investors, and asked them about Big Data and Machine Learning. It found that 70% thought that the importance of these tools will gradually grow for all investors. A further 23% said they expected a revolution, with rapid changes to the investment landscape. 

""There was widespread agreement that Big Data and Machine Learning is transforming the investment landscape across different trading frequencies, with more than 80% of participants expecting a reduction in relevance of traditional data sources,"" JPMorgan said in a note. 

To be specific, 52% of investors felt big data was already rendering traditional data sources (like financial statements and economic releases) ineffective. In other words, the quarterly reports that many regular investors rely on are already becoming less relevant. 

The rise of so-called alternative data has created a cottage industry of firms that source, process and consult on various data sources. The market for this data is expected to double in the next five years in the US, from $200 million today to $400 million, according to a recent TABB Group report.

More than half (51%) of investors surveyed said they expected to buy semi-processed data, while 29% said they wanted to fully process in-house by consuming raw data. 

Respondents to the survey were particularly interested in credit card and transactional data. Investors are able to use anonymous data gleaned from credit card statements, and the rise of online shopping, and the digital receipts we get in our email, is a also boon. That's because emailed receipts are usually itemized, giving investors greater detail into what people are buying.

The biggest impediment? Cost. While a lack of expertise and management buy-in were cited by respondents as challenges, the most frequently cited impediment was high-fixed costs.

That finding is striking, given JPMorgan's event attracted big money investors like BlackRock and AQR, with sizeable budgets to spend on the data, expertise and processing power.

If they find it expensive, the regular investor has no chance. "

# 1. What's Delphi do?

Delphi Automotive is a global technology company serving the automotive sector. The Company designs and manufactures vehicle components, and provides electrical and electronic, powertrain and active safety technology solutions to the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets. 

If you look at their client list... it's a who's who of the auto market and only one customers is over 10% of sales, GM. For 2016 the split was: GM 14%; Volkswagen 8%; Ford 6%; Fiat Chrysler 5%; GM China 5%; Daimler 5%; Peugeot Citroen 5%; Hyundai 3%; Geely 3%; and Toyota 2%. Though I wonder why there is no Renault, Honda, BMW or Tesla? Suppose you can't serve everyone!

From a sales perspective its 37% North America, 2% South, 35% Europe&amp;MEA and 26% Asia-Pac. So perhaps there's room to grow in Asia?

## How are they doing, number wise?

At first look the data looks nice, but that is partially 'cos of a big acquisition in Dec 2015 and another in Oct 2012. 

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $16.7bn | $15.2bn | $15.5bn | $15.1bn | $14.1bn|
|EPS | $4.59 | $5.06 | $4.48 | $3.89 | $3.33|

Management themselves are very happy to offer up ""Adjusted"" figures ignoring discontinued operations, papering over restructuring costs, one-off project costs, etc, etc. I hate that...but for now, let's park that concern.

Perhaps I shouldn't be too harsh, dividends are rising. Net debt is manageable at $3.5bn, i.e. 1.1x cashflow, and they've done an average buyback of nearly $1bn of stock each of the last 3 years.

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|DPS | $1.16 | $1.00 | $1.00 | $0.68 | $0.00|
|Buyback | $0.6bn | $1.2bn | $1.0bn | $0.5bn | $0.4bn|

Looking into next years, there's a clear expectation that jettisoning their Thermal Business, and the recent acquisition of Hellermann Tyton, are going to drive substantially higher margins!

|Metric|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $16.7bn | $16.9bn | $17.8bn | 
|EPS | $4.59 | $6.62 | $7.22 | 
|DPS | $1.16 | $1.18 | N/A | 

Though, there's one _fly_ in the ointment that are these forecasts...

## Powertrain

... the recent [announcement](http://delphi.com/media/media-releases/Details/delphi-announces-plans-for-tax-free-spin-off-of-powertrain-segment) that they want to split Delphi in two. With a tax free spin-off of their ""Powertrain Systems"" division. To give you an idea on it's size... it was 27% of sales and 31% of operating profit in the first quarter.

This is the unit that focuses on fuel systems, instead of electrical components. Who knows... maybe this is designed to sell off the unit most likely to be impacted by electric vehicles?

# 2. How do they stack up to the competition

It's not the biggest player in the market, though margins and returns are top class. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Delphi Automotive | $16,902M | 18% | 48%
Continental AG (ADR) | $46,211M | 15% | 20%
Johnson Controls International | $42,598M | 9% | -10%
TE Connectivity | $12,743M | 21% | 25%
Cummins Inc. | $17,807M | 12% | 21%
Genuine Parts Company | $15,527M | 8% | 21%
Lear Corporation | $18,893M | 10% | 32%
Autoliv Inc. | $10,252M | 12% | 16%
Visteon Corp | $3,169M | 10% | 24%

Which makes the 13x valuation a little surprising. Especially with it's growth rate looking good, and the management team being shareholder friendly, with spin-offs and streamlining the business.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
DLPH.K | $23,323M | 13x | 13% | 1% | 9%
CTTAY.PK | $45,100M | 13x | 9% | 2% | 12%
JCI | $39,466M | 16x | 14% | 2% | 4%
TEL | $27,135M | 16x | 9% | 2% | 12%
CMI | $26,443M | 17x | 14% | 3% | 10%
GPC | $13,492M | 19x | 8% | 3% | 9%
LEA | $10,057M | 9x | 11% | 1% | 14%
ALV | $9,140M | 17x | 8% | 2% | 13%
VC | $3,257M | 18x | 17% | 0% | 7%

Perhaps there is disappointment in the 1% dividend yield? Or no one's yet convinced in the 2017 forecast EPS of $6.62 a share? Or everyone knows about their ""adjusted figures"" inflating reality?

# 3. What does Wall Street think?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $98 for DLPH, which is a 13% upside. Unsurprisingly their recommendation to clients is _Buy_.  The spin-off sure was a nice boost, with the target jumping to $98 from $87 beforehand! But why not, it looks shareholder friendly, and this is a management team that's beaten forecasts 7 quarters in a row.

So I'm not surprised that the sentiment's improved over the last 6 months, as the valuation's risen from 10x earnings to 13x. Though it's good to note that in the last year the stock's traded anywhere from 10x to 17x earnings.

# 4. Kaput or motoring?

I'm tempted. Mid-single digit topline growth, potentially 10% at the bottom line, buybacks, spinoffs, and a willingness to make the right deals to drive efficiencies. 

We've missed the move from the low 60s to the high 80s. But isn't there operational reasons the stock can go higher over the long-term. And who knows, may there'll be a valuation / sentiment boost along the way?

Perhaps it was a _value_ play back in Oct. But isn't it really a quality stock?

# Description

The Kraft Heinz Company is a food and beverage company. The Company is engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Your know the brands: Heinz, Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Philadelphia, Planters, Velveeta, Lunchables, Maxwell House, Capri Sun, and Ore-Ida, among others!

|Product|Sauces|Dairy|Dry good|Frozen|Meats|Infant|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Sales 2016 | 26% | 21% | 9% | 8% | 10% | 3% |

So its ketchup and cream cheese that counts. But what about the 4 geographic segments?, i.e. the United States, Canada, Europe, and Rest of World.

|Region|USA|Canada|Europe|RoW|Total|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Sales 2016 | $19bn | $2bn | $2bn | $3bn | $27bn|

i.e. watch the US like a hawk!

## Recent financials 

But the history is a little crazy. With Buffett &amp; the Brazilians, 3G, buying Heinz in mid 2013. And then merging it with Kraft in mid 2015. As a result the numbers are a *mess*. 2016 is a full year of Heinz and Kraft. 2015 is 100% Heinz and 50% Kraft, 2014 is just Heinz. 

**Aside: if you have pro-forma data, please send it to me.**

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $27bn | $18bn | $11bn |
|Operating profit | $4bn | $1bn | $1bn |
|EPS | $2.81 | -$0.34 | -$0.17 | 
|DPS | $2.35 | $1.74 | -$0.17 | 

Looking at the annual report, here's how the explain pro-forma sales

&gt; Pro forma net sales decreased 3.5%, primarily due to the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency 2.5% ... Excluding these impacts, Organic Net Sales increased 0.3%.

i.e. not great. But on the EPS the flip from loss to gain is great... so their merger and integration plan is clearly yielding results. In fact, if you factor in a rake of adjustments they say they grow EPS on a pro-forma basis by over a $1. 

Separately, look at the long-term debt:

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Long-term debt | $30bn | $25bn | $13bn |

Hmmm... they sure aren't afraid of leveraging this cash cow, are they?

## Competition

Their margin is phenomenal. No one comes close, and the managers are focused on maintaining this. It's no wonder Buffett's a fan.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Kraft Heinz Co | $26,281M | 30% | 6%
Mondelez International Inc | $25,923M | 20% | 6%
General Mills, Inc. | $15,741M | 21% | 36%
Danone SA (ADR) | $24,103M | 17% | 13%
Kellogg Company | $12,873M | 18% | 39%
Hershey Co | $7,491M | 22% | 74%
Tyson Foods, Inc. | $36,911M | 10% | 20%

## Cash / Debt?

Kraft Heinz Co has $29,438M of net debt. That is 3.7x it's latest operating profit. To me that's a flag, but perhaps we need to relax a little given the management's track record?

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $98.21 for Kraft Heinz Co and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 9% to their target. Note: back in Feb the stock nearly hit the target price :)

# Valuation

Trading at a 10% premium to its peers feels reasonable. And its traded between 23 and 29x in the last 12 months. 

Peers |Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
KHC.O | $109,177M | 24x | 16% | 3% | 6%
MDLZ.O | $68,353M | 21x | 10% | 2% | 5%
GIS | $32,869M | 19x | 6% | 3% | 10%
DANOY.PK | $46,750M | 19x | 11% | 3% | 9%
K | $24,644M | 18x | 6% | 3% | 8%
HSY | $22,828M | 22x | 8% | 2% | 5%
TSN | $22,478M | 13x | 2% | 1% | 12%

Though as always with peer lists, the throw up other ideas... i.e. what's the story with Tyson? Is it cheap for a reason?

# Dividends

Kraft Heinz Co is forecast to pay a dividend of $2.40 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $2.38 per share. That is just a 1% growth. The forecast dividend of $2.40 compares to a forecast EPS of $3.70. i.e. Earnings are forecast to grow by nearly a $1 again this year.

So looks like there's going to be room to bring debt levels down, or start some buyback.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price didn't move, versus earnings forecasts up 13%. 

And that includes a lacklustre 1Q report at the start of this week. On the analyst call they talked about industry headwinds but... 

&gt; we are expecting profitable organic sales growth to ramp up as the year progresses, especially in the second half.

Their integration plan is on track to yield billion dollar savings and they expect continued sustainable expansion. 

Though perhaps the overtures to Unlever indicate why M&amp;A is needed for the next big leg up... they've build a substantial business in the US and Canada... but EMEA and APAC regions are still fresh pastures. 

# Well

It's a quality stock... even if it's a little debt heavy ... and though they failed to snag Unilever this time... it's only a matter of time before they catch an EU fish, I bet. Surely KHC can dominate food, as P&amp;G has dominated household goods?

26,2017-05-04,vegaseller,1,Applying Second Level Thinking,"""The first level thinker simply looks for the highest-quality company, the best product, the fastest earning growth or the lowest p/e ratio. He's ignorant of the very existence of a second level at which to think, and the need to pursue it. The second-level thinker goes through a much more complex process when thinking about buying an asset. Is it good? Do others think it's as good as I think it is? Is it really as good as I think it is? Is it as good as others think it is? How will it change? How do others think it will change? How is it priced given: its current condition; how I think its condition will change; how others think it will change; and how others think others think it will change? And that’s just the beginning.” - Howard Marks


Lets discuss some second level thinking ideas. 

My thoughts on Amazon vs Google:
Google is valued higher than Amazon because Amazon perceived as a low margin business compared to Google and because people benchmark Amazon against other retailers like Walmart while Google is often thought of as this high growth high margin online ads business with even higher upside potential (say cure cancer or make a quantum computer). 

But after looking at the success of Amazon Cloud (which is high margin) and the flop of various google projects from Google glass to google cars and even its horrendous lateness into the cloud game, I feel like the standard narrative that a engineering culture is best for a tech company is still not being challenged by investors. Amazon has been able to execute product by product because of the synergies of its flywheel model, while google has been flailing all over the place. I was reminded of a discussion I had with my engineer friend who worked at Microsoft about the future of AI, he was convinced that with Machine learning and improving graphics chips, we can do all sorts of things like household robots, dog walkers, etc. I then reminded him that specialization of labor was a thing and that it was infinitely more efficient to create an uber for maids and plumbers that integrates with some rudimentary smart sensors than it is to solve it with all robots as humans are good at doing small nuanced things very efficiently in uncontrolled environments and quickly and machines are better at doing big data analytics and precise things in controlled environments, so why bother with end-point automation? I also remember having a discussion with a Samsung project engineer who asked me what I thought the driver for Apple was. I said it was China growth and new product adoption/lock-in into the ecosystem but he was very convinced it was some super technical thing with the way the LED screens worked. I find technical people get very siloed in general and become clouded as to the big picture and that is probably what you see in Google. 

As a result, the market is probably significantly overpricing engineering staff welfare and feel good optics instead of actually getting stuff done. These are just some initial thoughts.

International | $5.2bn | $0.7bn | 13%|  15m |$2.5bn |
Global Commercial | $9.2bn | $1.9bn | 21%|  14m |$7.0bn |
Merchant Services | $4.4bn | $1.5bn | 33%| n/a | $2.5bn |

So clearly the least exciting bit is international. What's wrong with ""American""! But maybe we shouldn't be so negative on the International unit, as to a large extent, Amex is outsourcing the international business with 150 partners do the card issuing to consumers and negotiations with shops in over 130 countries. i.e. they've only 15m Amex cards internationally but another 49m partner cards!

But overall the best margins and returns are from shops. It's no wonder lots of businesses refuse Amex.

## Bringing it all together:

The top line is flatlining at best. And although the bottom line is looking good, that's driven by buybacks, not by operational efficiency. In fact, one-off gains have boosted earnings a lot in each of the last 3 years.

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $31bn | $33bn | $34bn | $33bn | $32bn|
|EPS | $3.89 | $4.88 | $5.56 | $5.05 | $5.65|

Now, I'm all for capital coming back to shareholders, but I'd like to see some growth too. In the annual report they wrote:

&gt; In a challenging economic, competitive and regulatory environment, we remain focused on our key priorities of accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting our cost base. In 2016, revenue was lower year-over-year, though revenue performance sequentially improved in the fourth quarter. We made a record level of business-building investments during 2016 and continued to make progress on our plans to remove $1 billion from our overall cost base by the end of 2017. In addition, we continued to leverage our strong capital position to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Amex, please forgive me, but aren't you a mainly US business? Isn't the Great Recession nearly 7 years past?

# 2. Amex vs the rest

Visa and Mastercard really aren't fair comparisons, from a business model perspective, since they don't actually manage end consumers. They are more like the ""Merchant Services"" unit of Amex.. just 3 to 4 times bigger.

Maybe Paypal and Discovery ar worth a look, as they are brands in their own right, so on that front, we can probably cheer both margins and returns. 

|Operations|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
American Express Company | $32,517M | 25% | 24%
Visa Inc | $16,829M | 68% | 17%
Mastercard Inc | $11,064M | 57% | 75%
Paypal Holdings Inc | $11,273M | 21% | 10%
Discover Financial Services | $8,810M | 53% | 22%
Fiserv Inc | $5,568M | 35% | 35%
Alliance Data Systems Corporation | $7,341M | 24% | 28%
Global Payments Inc | $3,870M | 21% | 12%
Square Inc | $1,791M | 0% | -17%

But it's when we get to valuation that the difference come clear. AXP and DFS are expect to be single digit growers. And it's reflected in the price. 

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|
AXP | $75,051M | 15x | 8% | 2% |
V | $221,874M | 29x | 15% | 1% |
MA | $133,781M | 29x | 15% | 1% | 
PYPL.O | $65,336M | 31x | 17% | 0% | 
DFS | $23,526M | 10x | 9% | 2% | 
FISV.O | $26,348M | 24x | 12% | 0% | 
ADS | $14,621M | 14x | 12% | 1% | 
GPN | $14,010M | 23x | 18% | 0% | 
SQ | $9,091M | -128x | 20% | 0% | 

Perhaps the assumption is that the ""moats"" around V MA and PYPL are significantly deeper. And that Amex's brand just isn't that defensible long term. An assumption, I'd argue with!

# 3. What does Wall Street thinks?

Although Wall Street says _Buy_ it's hardly putting it's neck out with a $84 price target. i.e. no upside!

And at 15 times earnings, the stock's valuation has ramped to a two year high, all the way from just 9x earnings back in Feb 2016.

# 4. Clear your card?

When I read management transcripts, I don't get the impression that the Amex card is either in the soup or super. For example:

&gt; Step in back, over the past several years we have embarked on a serious of initiatives to reposition the company drive sustainable revenue growth. Those efforts which we covered in Investor Day, include, amongst others, focusing on further penetrating commercial payments by leveraging our small business and middle market assets on our global commercial segments, driving more organic growth through expanded engagement with existing customers, better leveraging our digital and big data capabilities for new customer acquisition and other targeting, growing our merchant network and pursuing lending expansion opportunities. These action for targeted to provide a mix of returns over the short, medium and longer-term.

It feels very ""pedestrian"". Sure, I'll get some cash back in divides and appreciation with buyback. But it's hard to get excited. 

The card may be Platinum, but not the stock.

30,2017-06-24,wanmoar,134,Retailers: E-Commerce Sales as % of Total Sales,"- The data is on a trailing 12 month basis compiled from the 10 k/q filed with the SEC. 

- The name in brackets (where seen) is the parent company and the data represents only the subsidiary sales

- Where the chain offers e-comm sales but the entry is blank, it's because the retailer doesn't divulge that information or does not have an online offering. 

- The difference (if there is one) between the total, retail and the e-comm source comes from 'other revenues' which are normal membership (costco) or rental income or finance income (retailers with credit cards)

31,2017-06-22,wanmoar,15,Wal-Mart to vendors: get off Amazon's cloud,"excerpts below, full article here:

Wal-Mart uses some tech vendors' cloud apps that run on AWS, said Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Toporek. He declined to say which apps or how many, but acknowledged instances when Wal-Mart pushed for AWS alternatives.

""It shouldn't be a big surprise that there are cases in which **we'd prefer our most sensitive data isn't sitting on a competitor's platform**, "" he said, adding that it's a ""small number.""

An Amazon spokeswoman referred to Wal-Mart's moves as attempts to ""bully"" tech suppliers. ""Tactics like this are bad for business and customers,""

Snowflake Computing Inc., a data-warehousing service, was approached by a Wal-Mart client about handling its business from the retailer, Chief Executive Bob Muglia said. **The catch: Snowflake had to run those services on Azure.**

""They influence their vendors, which has influence on us,"" Mr. Muglia said of Wal-Mart.

The San Mateo, Calif., company had been developing an Azure offering, and ""Wal-Mart has expedited our work,"" said Mr. Muglia, a former senior Microsoft executive. Snowflake won the business from Wal-Mart's client.

**Other large retailers also have requested**, as Wal-Mart did, that service providers move away from AWS, according to technology vendors that work with retailers.

While Wal-Mart's **efforts aren't likely to staunch AWS's growth, it could boost rivals.**

""People jump through hoops to do business with Wal-Mart all the time,"" said Robert Hetu, an analyst with the research firm Gartner Inc. ""That should absolutely accelerate the competition from Azure.""

It has, **Microsoft said. ""The nudge from Wal-Mart has been pretty consistent,**"" said Judson Althoff, executive vice president in charge of Microsoft's global sales to business customers.

Lofty Labs, a software-development firm in Fayetteville, Ark., worked with a retail-analytics consulting company to build cloud-based forecasting tools for Wal-Mart. To win the business, Lofty Labs had to develop the application for Azure.

""That was a deal breaker,"" Lofty Labs President Casey Kinsey said. The service is the only one Lofty Labs ever developed to work on Azure. ""Everybody knows that Wal-Mart will not play ball with you if you use AWS."""

I have seen some mis-information regarding this, so I wanted to clear the air:


AMD's new server/data center chip offering will outperform the competition significantly. 
Forrest Norrod, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (""EESC"") Business Group said:


...""two-socket configuration, the chip could offer 64 cores, 4TB memory, and 128 PCI Express lanes, thus giving it 45 percent more cores, 122 percent more memory bandwidth, and 60 percent more I/O than the Xeon E5-2699A v4 (Broadwell).""

EPYC will perform 70% better in these applications, for 20% less cost.

This is a tremendous growth opportunity for AMD, who has been seriously strapped for cash, and with practically no server presence as of late.

34,2017-06-06,shane_stockflare,37,stockAday: Any inside Intel? $INTC,"In the post-PC world, has Intel an eye on the future?

# Key Stats for Intel Corporation

|Ticker|[INTC](https://stockflare.com/stock/intc.o)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Other Semiconductors
Latest price | $36.34
Value | $171,125M

# 1. What do thay do? 

Semiconductor chips. mainly!

If you are under 30 you may have missed the *Intel Inside* logos that came with every PC in the 80s and 90s. There was an axis called Wintel where Microsoft and Intel dominated, Microsoft Windows was the software, Intel the semi-conductors, and some ""dumb"" manufacturer put it all together into a box... then the smartphone hit. 

Has it hurt them? Hardly from a cashflow perspective, though it has killed off growth.

Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $59bn | $55bn | $56bn | $53bn | $53bn|
|EPS | $2.12 | $2.33 | $2.31 | $1.89 | $2.13|

When they describe their business, there are six exciting division names: Client Computing Group, Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, the Security Group, Programmable Solutions Group, and the New Technology Group. But the business is still driven by the old chips for PCs, etc business (55% of sales) and the data center / communications unit (29% of sales) with none of the other 4 divisions clocking more than 5% of sales. 

But having missed the smartphone race, which was *won* by ARM, Intel is now betting big on autonomous cars. In April they agreed to spend $15bn to buy Mobileye, a ""global leader in the development of computer vision and machine learning, data analysis, localization and mapping for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving.""

Will it work? Hard to tell. And Google, Tesla, Uber and a rake more folks are also playing in this space.

But let's look at the forecasts 2 years out, we can see they are starting to pick up!

Metric|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $59bn | $60bn | $62bn | 
|EPS | $2.12 | $2.86 | $2.97 | 

And if you are worried about INTC spending $15bn on Mobileye, note they currently have only $8bn of net debt, i.e. 0.4x it's latest operating profit. Plus they are selling their Security unit for $4bn. So it's balance sheet isn't stressed post deal. Therefore I can't see any reason to doubt their ability to keep paying nice divies and keep on buying back stock.

# 2. How do they compare?

Compared to the *old enemy* AMD they continue to dominate, in sales, margins and returns... but that's missing the point, as the semiconductor world has moved on. 

Versus the rest of the sector their margins look reasonable, but clearly they aren't best in class. 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Intel Corporation | $60,481M | 39% | 18%
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. | $4,424M | -7% | N/A
Broadcom Ltd | $15,608M | 30% | -15%
NVIDIA Corporation | $7,542M | 32% | 38%
Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) | $32,534M | 64% | 26%
Texas Instruments Incorporated | $13,764M | 46% | 38%
Micron Technology, Inc. | $14,733M | 32% | 5%
Analog Devices, Inc. | $4,006M | 35% | 11%
Skyworks Solutions Inc | $3,353M | 41% | 25%

But the margin doesn't seem to be the factor to watch... it's the fear of low growth. They are the only single-digit grower in the pack.

Can INTC re-ignite their cash-flows? Maintain the cashflows in the *legacy* business, and find new engines of growth? 

# 3. What's Wall Street thinks?

Despite INTC under performing the S&amp;P for the last few years, the brokers still like the stock and say *Buy*. Though their price target at $40 is only 10% above the current price.

Back in February management outlined a 3 year plan that focuses on efficiency, growth, better capital allocation and shareholder returns. All sensible stuff. So it's surprising that Wall Street isn't more excited, surely?

Note: the stock's traded between 11 and 16 times forecast earnings over the last year, so it's not feeling toppy at the moment. And management haven't missed earnings in over 3 years. 

# 4. Inside Intel?

How often is a cash cow, like Intel trading on 13x times? A cashcow where management has one eye on the next big thing, autonomous cars, and the other eye of increasing shareholder returns.

To me it seems like Wall Street isn't cutting them any slack. And unloved quality stocks are ones that tempt me! Sure, it may take 2 years for the success / failure to crystalize... but if I wait, surely I'll miss it?

35,2017-07-21,Maioranaa,0,Seed Invest Weekly Review,"Hey Guys, I'm relatively new here, but I've been interested in Seed Invest for some time. They submit a weekly news letter on start-ups to invest in this week and I thought I'd share what I think is the ""Best of the Week.""

I don't have enough money to start investing in these highly speculative companies yet because I want to get my portfolio to a larger size so a 10k a year investment in a bunch of different companies isn't too big of a deal for me. If anyone else is currently investing in SeedInvest companies please leave a comment or give me your take on what is the best of the week.

The company I was most excited about this week was Kindara.

Overview: Kindara is a fertility app, social network, and thermometer and it has three potential revenue streams. While this is not a product I would personally use I can immediately see how it could help revolutionize how women manage fertility based on providing extensive data and charting that data. With the added in bonus of the thermometer that automatically uploads to the phone the ease in reporting the data is even better. The design looks Apple worthy and it seems like it has the best of both hardware and software while it’s competitors have only one or the other.

Kindara is a bit more mature than the other companies showcased this week on SeedInvest and they are trying to raise a series A with a 8 million dollar capitalization. They have previously raised 2 rounds at about 5 million for a pre-seed round and 1 million for a seed round. Minimum investment is 1000 dollars.

My Take: 
While I have no need for this service and device I can see how it would be very useful for a couple or a mother trying to start a family or perhaps understand how to ensure that their family is started at the right time.

Kindara operates on freemium model for their app, but the Wink (thermometer) makes them money, and there is a both a subscription offering as well as product partnerships as potential revenue streams for the future.

If they can grow their community and enter into Europe and Asia I think this could be big. Half the world’s population are women. If I had a 1000 dollars to place a risky bet I would place it here."
36,2017-07-18,learner1314,23,Jason Zweig: Stock Picking Is Dying Because There Are No More Stocks to Pick,"In less than two decades, more than half of all publicly traded companies have disappeared. There were 7,355 U.S. stocks in November 1997, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. Nowadays, there are fewer than 3,600.

A close look at the data helps explain why stock pickers have been underperforming. And the shrinking number of companies should make all investors more skeptical about the market-beating claims of recently trendy strategies.

Back in November 1997, there were more than 2,500 small stocks and nearly 4,000 tiny “microcap” stocks, according to CRSP. At the end of 2016, fewer than 1,200 small and just under 1,900 microcap stocks were left.

Most of those companies melted away between 2000 and 2012, but the numbers so far show no signs of recovering.

Several factors explain the shrinking number of stocks, analysts say, including the regulatory red tape that discourages smaller companies from going and staying public; the flood of venture-capital funding that enables young companies to stay private longer; and the rise of private-equity funds, whose buyouts take shares off the public market.

For stock pickers, differentiating among the remaining choices is “an even harder game” than it was when the market consisted of twice as many companies, says Michael Mauboussin, an investment strategist at Credit Suisse in New York who wrote a report this spring titled “The Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks.”

That’s because the surviving companies tend to be “fewer, bigger, older, more profitable and easier to analyze,” he says — making stock picking much more competitive.

Consider small-stock funds. Often, they compare themselves to the Russell 2000, an index of the U.S. stocks ranked 1,001 through 3,000 by total market value. “Twenty years ago, there were over 4,000 stocks smaller” than the inclusion cutoff for the Russell 2000, says Lubos Pastor, a finance professor at the University of Chicago. “That number is down to less than 1,000 today.”

So fund managers have far fewer stocks to choose from if they venture outside the index —  the very area where the best bargains might be found. More money chasing fewer stocks could lead some fund managers to buy indiscriminately, regardless of value.

Eric Cinnamond is a veteran portfolio manager with a solid record of investing in small stocks. Last year, he took the drastic step of shutting down his roughly $400 million mutual fund, Aston/River Road Independent Value, and giving his investors their money back.

“Prices got so crazy in small caps, I fired myself,” he says. “My portfolio was 90% in cash at the end, because I couldn’t find anything to buy. If I’d kept investing, I was sure I’d lose people their money.”

He adds, “It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done professionally, but I didn’t feel I had a choice. I knew my companies were overvalued.”

Mr. Cinnamond hopes to return to the market when, in his view, values become attractive again. He doesn’t expect recent conditions to be permanent.

The evaporation of thousands of companies may have one enduring result, however — and it could catch many investors by surprise.

Most research on historical returns, points out Mr. Mauboussin, is based on the days when the stock market had twice as many companies as it does today. “Was the population of companies so different then,” he asks, “that the inferences we draw from it might no longer be valid?”

So-called factor investing, also known as systematic or smart-beta investing, picks hundreds or thousands of stocks at a time based on common sources of risk and return. Among them: how big companies are, how much their shares fluctuate, how expensive their shares are relative to asset value and so on.

But the historical outperformance of many such factors may have been driven largely by the tiniest companies — exactly those that have disappeared from the market in droves.

Before concluding that small stocks or cheap “value” stocks will outrace the market as impressively as they did in the past, you should pause to consider how they will perform without the tailwinds from thousands of tiny stocks that no longer exist.

The stock market has more than tripled in the past eight years, so the eclipse of so many companies hasn’t been a catastrophe. But it does imply that investing in some of the market’s trendiest strategies might be less profitable in the future than they looked in the past.

37,2017-07-09,SillySausage87,8,AAOI vs ANET (Data Center Investment),"Both fantastic pick n shovel plays on data with huge potential.

AAOI is a small cap so perhaps has greater upside.

ANET ain't too large yet that it can't multiply a few more times.

Both have strong balance sheets and good management.

Both have big name customers, like Amazon.

AAOI looks cheaper by traditional metrics, but it's had quite a run recently, although perhaps that doesn't matter due to the recent tech sector correction and its big run was because of sales (not hype and future growth hopes) - so well deserved actual growth.

ANET has a track record of staying ahead of the competition. Visionary founder directing the technology side of things, pretty innovative.

I'd consider buying both, but I don't like spreading my money out over too many companies (and there's only so much exposure I need to data related companies... other things interest me too).

What do you guys think?"

Is it worth the digging?

# 1. Looking at the chips

Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the  semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh?

They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients.

1. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit
2. Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients
3. Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc
4. the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales.

Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. 

Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better.

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

|EPS | $0.09 | $0.21 | $0.87 | $1.12 | $1.54 |$3.08|
|DPS | $0.35 | $0.39 | $0.40 | $0.40 | $0.40 |$0.41|

Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position.

# 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels

When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Applied Materials, Inc. | $12,942M | 26% | 36%
*Picks 'n' Shovels* |||
ASML Holding NV (ADR) | $8,459M | 35% | 15%
Lam Research Corporation | $7,215M | 26% | 23%
KLA-Tencor Corp | $3,461M | 39% | 116%

Micron Technology, Inc. | $17,401M | 40% | 18%
Intel Corporation | $60,481M | 39% | 18%

And how does this filter thro' to valuation? It doesn't. Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! 

Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest.

# 3. Love boring?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter!

Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have:

&gt; Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 

# 4. Rising tide?

Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? 

All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it.

But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

Sounds like their new sequencer has been a big success, and they're talking about getting the cost of sequencing a whole genome down to $100.

40,2017-09-25,shane_stockflare,52,stockAday: can Gilead's Kite soar? $GILD,"# First, a mea culpa

I've neglected stockAday for the last 2 months, as my day job has been testing. So to get back in the swing of things, let's do a retrospective.

# The benefit of hindsight

A year ago, we wrote [Gilead: was it just a fad? $GILD](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockaday/comments/54n3v1/gilead_was_it_just_a_fad_gild/).

The stock was at $81 and we asked:

&gt; Having sewn up the HIV market, they then captured the Liver (Hepatitis C) market. No wonder the long-term investor has a 5-bagger on their hands. But is the stock a 2-hit wonder and now a value trap?

Today the stocks at $83. :( So value trap it was.

# Key Stats

|Ticker|[$GILD](https://stockflare.com/stock/gild.o)|
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Bio Therapeutic Drugs|
Latest price | $83.27|
Value | $109B|
Daily vol | $675M
Date | 25 September 2017

# What's 12 months to a pharma giant?

Here's how the key figures changed

|$GILD|a year ago|today|change|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Target price | $105 | $83 | -21% | 
|Sales forecast | $30.5bn | $25.9bn | -15% | 
|Earnings forecast | $11.75 | $8.78 | -25% | 
|PE ratio | 7x | 9x | +43% | 

So forecasts have been trashed, the stock's treaded water, the valuation has increased... though at 9x it is clearly still ""depressed""!

# Who's Gilead anyway?

Let's recap on who they are:

Gilead Sciences is a biopharmaceutical company. Its portfolio of products and pipeline of investigational drugs includes treatments for HIV/AIDS, liver diseases (Hepatitis C), cancer, inflammatory and respiratory diseases and cardiovascular conditions. 

Here's the last 5 years and the forecasts for the next 2

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $9.7bn | $11.2bn | $24.9bn | $32.6bn | $30.4bn| $25.9bn|$22.9bn|
|EPS | $1.64 | $2.01 | $7.95 | $12.37 | $10.08 |$8.78|$7.49|

But the forecasts are really not that representative... since Gilead is in the process of an $12bn deal to acquire [$KITE](https://stockflare.com/stock/kite.o). Wow. $12bn for a cancer business that should do $40m of sales this year. And the stock jumped on the deal.

# Why the renewed optimism?

Here's what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite_Pharma) says about Kite Pharma:

&gt; Kite Pharma is a publicly held, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products with a primary focus on engineered autologous T cell therapy designed to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and eradicate tumors.

So it's a therapy where our own cells are modified, and then used to seek and destroy cancer. If this proves to work... then Gilead will be a 3 trick pony! 

But you'd better believe that, if you are going to ride the stock. Here's their deal [presentation](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/882095/000110465917054030/a17-21067_1ex99d1.htm) from the company. 

# Is there a margin of safety?

With sales and earning expected to fall in 2018, the stock's trading on 11x 2018 earnings, and although that's a bargin versus the sector, there are others in a similar rut (e.g. Pfizer, Abbvie and Amgen). 

Big pharma|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
GILD.O | $108,745M | 9x | -8% | 3% | 14%
PFE | $214,146M | 14x | 6% | 4% | 10%
MRK | $177,633M | 17x | 6% | 3% | 8%
ABBV.K | $139,451M | 16x | 14% | 3% | 8%
AMGN.O | $135,544M | 15x | 4% | 2% | 10%
CELG.O | $112,572M | 20x | 22% | 0% | 3%
BMY | $103,906M | 21x | 9% | 2% | 8%
LLY | $92,384M | 20x | 11% | 2% | 7%

Sure the cashflows are attractive, but it doesn't feel like Kite is going to lift the ship until 2019 at the earliest. In it's press release, Gilead said:

&gt; The transaction will provide opportunities for diversification of revenues, and is expected to be neutral to earnings by year three and accretive thereafter. 

i.e. no positive impact to their bottom line until 2020. Therefore, I don't see a margin for safety, yet! And with Wall Street saying their target price is $83, they don't seem convinced either.

# What's another year?

The excitement of KITE has now passed. Volumes are returning to trend... there was an increase to sales guidence back in late July, and no one cared. 

Sure, the hot money abandoned Gilead over the last two years, as the stock's gone ex growth. And it's hard to see it returning, until there's evidence that Kite's going to soar!

But who wants to join the hot money. Shouldn't we do our own research? If Kite's a cure, then we'd best get ahead of the momentum trade. Kite's first product should be approved at the end of this year in the US. Then Europe in 2018. They are gearing up for a commerical launch and have the manufacturing all preped. 

I want to believe in Kite. But I fear it's another rocky year ahead. I suspect the results of the core business will continue to weigh on the stock. For now, I'm going to pass.

When the KITE deal closes at the end of the year, I'll revisit. But for now, I don't see a margin for safety or near term catalyst.

41,2017-09-22,artofsaving,0,The SEC Hack: What Investors Need to Know,"Consumers’ angst over the security of sensitive financial data isn’t getting much help these days. Two weeks ago, one of the big three credit bureaus, Equifax, reported hackers had accessed the personal information of more than half of the adult population in the U.S. On Wednesday, it was the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing its systems had been breached — back in 2016.

The SEC, a government agency created during the Great Depression to oversee all financial markets, revealed in its statement that hackers last year exploited a software vulnerability in its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (Edgar) computer system. This gave the hackers access to nonpublic information about publicly traded companies.

What does this hack mean to individual investors? The short answer is, probably not much. But that doesn’t mean they should ignore the details of this incident.

&gt; People create fake versions of big companies’ websites all the time, usually for phishing purposes. But the companies do not usually link to them by mistake.
&gt; 
&gt; Equifax, however, did just that after Nick Sweeting, a software engineer, created an imitation of equifaxsecurity2017.com, Equifax’s page about the security breach that may have exposed 143 million Americans’ personal information. Several posts from the company’s Twitter account directed consumers to Mr. Sweeting’s version, securityequifax2017.com. They were deleted after the mistake was publicized.
&gt; 
&gt; By Wednesday evening, the Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers had blacklisted Mr. Sweeting’s site, and he took it down. By that time, he said, it had received about 200,000 hits.
&gt; 
&gt; Fortunately for the people who clicked, Mr. Sweeting’s website was upfront about what it was. The layout was the same as the real version, complete with an identical prompt at the top: “To enroll in complimentary identity theft protection and credit file monitoring, click here.” But a headline in large text differed: “Cybersecurity Incident &amp; Important Consumer Information Which is Totally Fake, Why Did Equifax Use A Domain That’s So Easily Impersonated By Phishing Sites?”

&gt; It would be just as easy for phishers to create their own versions of the Equifax page, and that would be bad news for anyone entering the information required to enroll in identity theft protection: their surname and the last six digits of their Social Security number. (In Mr. Sweeting’s version, the form was disabled so that no information was saved.)
&gt; 
&gt; “Their site is dangerously easy to impersonate,” Mr. Sweeting said in an email, noting that he had created the site solely to draw attention to the weakness of Equifax’s security. “It only took me 20 minutes to build my clone. I can guarantee there are real malicious phishing versions already out there.”
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s in everyone’s interest to get Equifax to change this site to a reputable domain,” he added. “I knew it would only cost me $10 to set up a site that would get people to notice, so I just did it.”

&gt; “We apologize for the confusion,” the statement said. “Consumers should be aware of fake websites purporting to be operated by Equifax. Our dedicated website for consumers to learn more about the incident and sign up for free credit monitoring is https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, and our company homepage is equifax.com. Please be cautious of visiting other websites claiming to be operated by Equifax that do not originate from these two pages.”
&gt; 
&gt; An Equifax spokeswoman, Marisa Salcines, did not respond when asked why the company had created a separate website rather than a subdomain of equifax.com.
&gt; 
&gt; That, cybersecurity experts said, was the key mistake. Phishers cannot create a page on the equifax.com domain, so if the website were hosted there instead, it would be easy for users to tell that the page was legitimate.
&gt; 
&gt; “You would think that would be the obvious place to start,” said Rahul Telang, a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon University. “Create a subdomain so that if somebody tries to fake it, it becomes immediately obvious.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Equifaxsecurity2017.com,” on the other hand, looks so unofficial that Mr. Telang said even he had been unsure at first whether it was safe to enter his information.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Sweeting explained in his email that a Linux command, “wget,” allows anyone to download the contents of a website, “including all images, HTML, CSS, etc.”
&gt; 
&gt; “It was super easy to just suck their whole site down with wget and throw it on a $5 server,” he wrote. “It currently has the same type of SSL certificate as the real version, so from a trust perspective, there’s no way for users to authenticate the real one vs. my server.”
&gt; 
&gt; Mr. Telang said Equifax’s actions suggested that the company had never anticipated or planned for a data breach.
&gt; 
&gt; “If you don’t have a plan in place, you will find different ways to screw it up,” he said. “Equifax is just a perfect example of that.”
&gt; 
&gt; All of the incorrect tweets ended with “-Tim,” indicating the name of the Equifax employee who wrote them. The Equifax spokeswoman did not say whether any disciplinary action had been taken, and Mr. Sweeting said he hoped the employee had not been fired.
&gt; 
&gt; “They probably just Googled for the URL and ended up finding the fake one instead,” he said. “The real blame lies with the people who originally decided to set the site up badly.”"
43,2017-09-10,InterestingNews1,0,Nano Cap with massive opportunity in remote monitoring and big data – Schmitt Industries,"First up, this is a highly speculative nano cap stock with additional risk and zero liquidity.  

Nonetheless, with huge opportunities for growth and hidden asset value suggesting the stock trades at a 33% discount to net tangible assets, Schmitt Industries’ (SMIT) story is one that should be of interest to both growth and value investors.  In summary the thesis based on;

1.	Rapid growth in remote tank monitoring protected by patented intellectual property and with huge total addressable market 
2.	Zero debt and over depreciated property results in stock price discount to (hidden) asset value

The company has a number of product lines that are growing at a healthy rate and discussed below.  But for the moment let us concentrate on the juicy bit.  Xact sensors currently only account for 20% of revenues but it’s growing rapidly and has huge potential.

Xact sensors allow the precise monitoring of tank fill level information, e.g. Propane or Diesel, at any location.  There are many applications for this technology – however a typical example would be telecommunication towers based in remote areas that rely on backup power from diesel generators. It is essential to monitor the fuel tanks for the generators to ensure that fuel levels are sufficient to sustain the tower in an emergency, and also to detect sudden drops that could indicate fuel theft. The cheapest and most efficient way to do this is through remote sensors.

Schmitt Industries were granted a patent in 2012 for its ultrasonic liquid level monitoring system (Xact) and have a further patent pending for event monitoring.  Product break out is not provided on a quarterly basis but it is available in the annual report which shows Xact’s revenues increased from $0.877 million in 2013 to $2.437 million in 2017 representing a CAGR of 29%.  Importantly the annual growth rate increased to 37% in 2017 suggesting that this growth is accelerating.

Such strong growth is meaningful and exciting.  The potential global market for remote tank monitoring is huge with applications in various industries including oil and fuel, chemical, mining, agriculture and automotive.  Some commentators estimate the market will grow annually by 6% to reach $859 million by 2020.  If Schmitt can win even a tiny share of this with its intellectual property protected business then there could be huge upside.
OK, I hear you say, that’s great but its a bit of a long shot for a nano cap – what happens if it fails completely.  Well again the stock looks like a bargain.  However proving it involves a lot of numbers so I have put the detail below and just do the summary for now.

Schmitt has zero debt and a market cap of $5.87 million which looks cheap compared to a book value of $6.98 million.  Now to be conservative we need to exclude intangible assets of $0.6 million and haircut both the accounts receivable and the stocks as the realisable value in a wind up situation would probably be less (lets assume 50% for accounts and 25% for stocks).  However, and here is the kicker, we also have to check if there is any hidden value in the property as real estate values are much more resilient (as property has many alternative uses) and rising prices in a strong property market coupled with depreciated accounting values means that we can often find hidden value.

This is exactly the case with Schmitt.  Based in Portland Oregon, Schmitt owns outright 40,000 square feet of real estate and has benefited from a strong property market.  The company recently listed its 10,000 square foot Headquarters for sale for $2.7 million suggesting the property on the balance sheet (valued at $0.865 million) has been overly depreciated.  Additionally the company has a further 30,000 square footage of property in Portland.  If that property is conservatively valued at half the price of the HQ it would be worth $4.05 million. 

In fairness the company didn’t sell it’s HQ in the end but the value looks achievable in a thriving market.  Portland was recently ranked as the 39th best (out of 300) real-estate markets in the US by WalletHub based on long-term growth, equity and profit.

So taking these tangible assets with discounted stocks and receivables and adding the revalued property assets and we get an estimated asset value of $9.85 million.  Deducting total liabilities of $2.03 million we get a net figure of $7.82 million compared to its current market capitalisation of $5.87 million.  That’s still a discount of 33%.  Not bad for a downside scenario.

Please remember, again, to be careful.  This is a nano cap stock with additional risks, zero liquidity and at best is highly speculative.   This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are not suitable for all investors. Please do your own research.

Finally business summary provided below for those who are interested.

Schmitt Industries has a fairly simple business following its decision to focus efforts on three major product lines – SBS, Acuity and Xact.  In summary the three product lines make sensors to monitor 

1.	SBS --   Tool manufacturers need to ensure precision in their manufacturing processes and an unbalanced grinding machine will lead to poor quality products, will be inefficient from a cost perspective and ultimately can be damaging to the equipment.  SBS sensors monitor the vibration of grinding machines to optimise production.
2.	Acuity  produces dimensional and positional measurement sensors.  These are required for a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications.  Forest products companies use Acuity sensors for measuring the size of logs and lumber. Steel mills use Acuity lasers to measure the width of continuously-cast hot steel. Semiconductor manufacturers use sensors to precisely monitor the position of components.  
3.	Xact sensors allow the precise monitoring of tank fill level information, e.g. Propane or Diesel, at any location.  There are many applications for this technology – a typical example would be telecommunication towers based in remote areas that rely on backup power from diesel generators. It is highly important to monitor the fuel tanks for the generators to ensure that fuel levels are sufficient to sustain the tower in an emergency, and also to detect sudden drops that could indicate fuel theft.

The elimination of smaller lines has been a drag on growth but the efforts are now beginning to pay dividends as revenues increased 6% ($0.712 million) to $12.4 million in FYE May 2017.  Revenues in the Q4 increased 22.5% to $3.65 million with stronger sales in both North America and Asia being cited.

45,2017-09-05,cwwmbm,137,BTFD (Buy The Dip) philosophy,"So, I've been doing some thinking that it would be nice to see some stats behind BTFD mentality. For that, the formalized metrics would have to be established of:

- What is the ""dip""?
- When do you exit to avoid being in the future dip?
- What's the performance like?

Obviously, the stats would have to go back enough to make sure we account for at least a couple of major recessions.

First, some generic considerations:

- I would personally like to make 7-15 roundtrip trades per year.
- No day trading. Buy and sell at market close.
- I'd like to time them so that I'm keeping cash for majority of the time.
- I don't aim to beat the market, but I do aim to outperform the market in bear and flat markets on average.

So, one of the key metrics in my definition of ""dip"" is RSI. Your may vary. We all heard of undersold/overbought conditions. However the default RSI period is 14 days and that's just way too much. It's very slow moving and a lot of the dips I'd be trying to capture will be missed. We're trying to deal on the scale of 5-15 days per trade. In other trading strategies I've considered over the past 2 years I've been heavily dealing with RSI(2) and RSI(5), so let's stick with them.

We'll define the ""dip"" as RSI(2)&lt;=15 and RSI(5)&lt;=40 (obviously, these numbers aren't just random, they came from doing an analysis of the last 30 years of SPX performance).

Next, we need to define when do we exit. Criteria 1 will be ""overbought"" condition of RSI(2)&gt;=95 and RSI(5)&gt;=85. However it might take months to get there, especially in the bear market, so we also need a Plan B. A lot of trend reversal and technical analysis based strategies rely on crossing EMA(8), so out plan B is exit when we cross below EMA(8). Let's also cap our gains at 10% per trade.

Next, we'll need to create some exceptions to the cases when the massive sell off occurs:

- Don't enter a position for a at least a day after 4% or more daily decline
- Stop loss of 5%.

Here are the backtest results:

Year | SPY performance | BTFD SPY performance | # of trades

2000 | -9.74% | 5.90% | 15
2001 | -11.76% | -5.53% | 15

- Average loss: ~2.6%
- Average days in trade: 9
- Average trades per year: 11

Parameter | SPY | BTFD SPY
---------|----------|----------
Annualized return | 5.13% (~7% with dividends) | 13.46%
Worst year | -36% (2008) | -5.33% (2001)
Best year | +32% (2013) | +26.78% (2003)
Number of years with negative returns | 4 | 2
Number of years with &gt;10% | 10 | 11
Largest drawdown | 55.19% (2009) | 26.96% (2002)



Instead of conclusion, few additional fun facts:

- All backtesting was done in Excel based on the historical data from Yahoo Finance. It only goes back to 1994. 2001 was the first negative year since then using this strategy.
- I think this shows that BTFD works.
- Backtesting the same thing on QQQ yielded same-ish results.
- When backtesting on several different ETFs you need to account for higher volatility of some of them. Example - for ETFs like QQQ, XLK, XBI the maximum allowed daily decline should be more than 4% as they are more likely to occur routinely. Same goes for stop losses for them, as well as profit caps.
- If you go further and analyze the behavior of volatility and volume during the crashes you can time your entrance a bit better via additional conditions on Volume EMA and Volatility. I put the following condition: do not enter the trade is the Volume exceeds VolumeEMA by 35% and Volatility exceeds 10% at the same time. It brought the annualized return up to 14.59%, and decreased the largest drawdown from 27 to 21%. This was done after an observation that a lot of big dips (i.e. the ones where it goes much lower than our pre-set ""dip"" definition) start with the massive increase in volume. This condition makes sure we don't enter the trade in the first 1-2-3 days of the ""big dip"".
- When the stop loss is triggered it doesn't mean the system doesn't buy the same dip, it defaults to the same rules of entering the trade, often entering the trade the next day after the stop loss. The philosophy here is that the larger the dip the better the recovery. Absence of stop loss worsens the performance slightly - to an annualized return of 12.39%.
- If instead of buying SPY at the dip you buy a 3x leveraged ETF your annualized return will be 37.37% over the same period. Your wors year will be -22.49%, your best year 94.81%, and your largest drawdown -68.34%"
46,2017-10-23,raequin,5,Capital gains investment and climate change,"Tomorrow, my wife and I are to sell a rental condo.  After paying the realtor fees and the mortgage we should clear about $50k.  We have $22k in student loans and a $13k auto loan.  We also have a twenty-six years on the mortgage for our primary residence.  I'm about forty years old and hope to work at my current job until retirement.  In addition to my wife and myself, our family includes two small children.  The impact of climate change on their lives is one concern.

We live in Georgia, where increased temperatures, frequency of tornadoes, and number of dry days are all projected.  It seems nice to have land in the North to move to after retirement and for our descendants to use if they want to.  Well, maybe not the North, I'm not sure this southern guy could handle the cold, but perhaps West Virginia or something.

Please give me your opinion on what we should do with the money we'll be getting.  I'm describing three options I've considered, below, but am open to any possibilities.


1. Pay off student loans and car.  Buy a solar electric system for our house.

  &lt;&gt; Pros:

    (a) According to my calculations, we could double our investment in twenty years (that's assuming we can take the full 30% tax credit for the system, if not then payback takes longer)
    
    (b) The power in our state comes primarily from burning coal --- solar would enable us to be part of the solution, instead of part of the problem
    
    (c) No debt (other than house)

  &lt;&gt; Cons:
  
    (a) We don't usually have to pay when filing tax returns, so I don't know that the federal tax credit would help us much, though this year we'll have the capital gains tax on the condo but that should not be as big as 30% of the price of the solar system
    
    (b) Little money for smaller improvements around the house

2. Pay off one student loan and either the car or the other loan.  Buy land up north.

  &lt;&gt; Pros:
  
    (a) More hospitable climate for progeny

  &lt;&gt; Cons:
  
    (a) There goes all our investment capability
    
    (b) Still making monthly payments on either car or a student loan

3. Pay of student loans and car.  Invest approximately $10k of the remaining money

  &lt;&gt; Pros:
  
    (a) Maximum financial flexibility (still have capital on hand)
    
    (b) No debt (other than house)
    
    (c) Could pay for various home improvements etc.

  &lt;&gt; Cons:
  
    (a) Still burning coal for our power
    
    (b) I don't know anything about investing money

47,2017-10-22,InterestingNews1,3,"Last week’s big news stories and articles on earnings, value stocks, growth stocks, dividends and insiders","**Earnings News**

With earnings season well underway there are lots of reports of high flying stocks still doing well and poor performers continuing to do badly.  More interesting though is IBM which looks like it’s about to stop doing badly and start doing well and it has a stock price that hasn’t realised it yet.  

Commentators on the stock are not hard to find, both believers and bemoaners, but what interests me is that the numbers are now beginning to point to a recovery.  

Specifically the strategic imperatives business which now accounts for 45% of revenues grew by 11% while the older legacy business fell by 8%.  More importantly though is that growth at the strategic initiatives business which (having increased 7% last quarter) is beginning to accelerate and saw growth of 20% in the cloud business, “As a Service” grew revenue by 24% and Security solutions grew 50%.

People often talk about a company being on the verge of a turn-around or an inflexion point when it’s already well priced into the stock.  With a TTM PE of 13.5 and yield of 3.7%, IBM looks like a refreshing exception. 


**Value Stocks**

There was an excellent article in Seeking Alpha by “Uncorrelated Returns” and also in Barrons about Conduent (CNDT), the business outsourcing firm that was purchased in 2009 by Xerox.

The company was poorly managed for years by Xerox and saw its margins drop from mid teens to high single digits.  However, since then;

*	the business has been spun off (last December) so it is once again in control of its own destiny,

*	Carl Icahn has bought in

*	CEO Ashok Vemuri has been appointed (having previously worked at Infosys and 2 years successfully turning around iGate as CEO before its sale to Capgemini) and is cutting costs and unprofitable businesses like an owner.

With the CEO’s successful track record and $700 million of cost reductions targeted, it’s not difficult to see margins increasing from 10% to 15% and boosting EPS to $1.42. With the stock currently at $15.72 that’s a PE multiple of just 11.1.

Consensus earnings forecasts are a bit more conservative than mine at $1.17. But with outsourcing peers priced on PEs of around 19 a price for Conduent of $22.00 looks achievable. That’s 40% higher than Fridays close.


**There was also an excellent article on Tractor Supply in Fool.com entitled “How Tractor Supply Is Defying the Train Wreck of Retail”.  **

Tractor Supply is a virtual monopoly, supplying rural areas with everything they need from fencing, farm tools, footwear, farm gear, pet feed and supplies. With 1,630 stores it has a first mover advantage in rural areas where it is able to charge a healthy premium as it has largely avoided competition from the big retailers and ecommerce. This looks set to continue as rural areas don't meet the return of investment requirements of the big retailers, Tractor Supply’s heavy products are not suitable for drone delivery and the firm has generated brand loyalty from customers who enjoy meeting at its stores and catching up with a chat.

This has allowed Tractor Supply to grow sales by 9% CAGR over the past 3 years and EPS by over 12% to $3.27 in 2016.  Consensus forecasts are for EPS of $3.62 next year and $4.01 in 2019.

Despite its excellent prospects the stock price has fallen by 25% from 52 week highs and is now trading on a TTM PE of 17.8 and forward PE of 14.7. It appears that Tractor Supply’s best bargain may be its own shares.


**Growth Stocks**

Several good articles on TJX this week but my favourite was Seeking Alpha’s “TJX: Sailing In Slumping Retail Market” highlighting TJX's planned store openings as a driver for earnings and the stock price.  TJX is a brilliant company with 21 years of consecutive same store growth and there is little sign that that growth is reducing.

Management plan to increase store count by almost 50% from 3,800 to 5,600 with 260 new stores planned for 2017. It’s also developing its successful HomeSense stores, loyalty cards and ecommerce.

The current SP and PE would suggest a company that is approaching maturity and the end of its growth era. Or perhaps it just got caught up in the recent retail sell off.

However that presents an opportunity for investors as TJX has years of growth ahead and is nothing like the other bricks and mortar retailers.


**Dividend**

A well titled article in Fool.com “3 High-Yield Growth Stocks” threw up a number of interesting REITs.  My favorite was Iron Moutain (IRM) with a stable business, stable cash flow, 5.6% dividend yield and forecasted 9% growth in adjusted funds from operations.

It’s a REIT operating in data management and shredding. It services more than 230,000 customers worldwide, including 95% of the Fortune 1000 and that business is stable and growing.  Ideal for those looking for stable modest growth.


**Insider**

John Malone purchased 1.6 million stock in Liberty Global PLC LiLAC (LILAK) in July at around the current price of $22 taking his total holding to around $400 million.

The stock is a tracker of Liberty Globals cable assets in Latin America and the Carribean.  A region that is benefitting from increased penetration of multichannel TV, broadband and wireless. The stock rose to around $27 on the news but has since fallen back to $22.04.

Stock price down almost 50% over the past 18 months despite steady revenue growth, forecast growth of 7%-9% and a valuation of just 5.2 times net operating cash flow.

Operating in a region that is benefitting from increased penetration of multichannel TV, broadband and wireless LILAK (with the largest fibre optic network) is well placed to benefit from growth.
Shorter term a signifiant catalyst exists from LILAK's transition from a tracker status to regular standalone stock. Liberty Global recently said it remains on track for a spin-off of LiLAK by the end of the year. Such a move would be bullish as it would widen potential ownership to funds that aren’t permitted to hold tracker stocks and is generally preferred by investors.

The stock tripled from 2012 to 2017 versus the S&amp;P500 doubling. Nice. Can the good times continue?

# 1. What's a stock exchange these days?

Nasdaq, Inc. is a provider of trading, clearing, exchange technology, regulatory, securities listing, information and public company services. It has four segments: 

* Market Services (36% sales / 43% profits);
* Corporate Services (28% sales / 16% profits); 
* Information Services (24% sales / 34% profits), and; 
* Market Technology (12% sales / 7% profits).

But let's dig a little, _Market Services_ is pure trading. _Corporate_ is IPOs and investor relations tools for companies. Nasdaq is particularly good at that. _Info_ is both selling data on trades / etc and Indices , and _Technology_ sells it's tech expertise to 85 other stock exchanges inc. Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Egypt, Turkey, Malaysia, Dubai, Switzerland, etc, etc.

So as you'd expect the core stock exchange business, has helped Nasdaq build strong franchises across the entire trading value chain. 

# 2. And a Bull Market = $$$

The company and analysts tend to look at the net revenues, i.e. after any transaction expenses from running the stock exchange, and this has grown by $100 to $200m a year recently. 

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Total Revenue | $3.1bn | $3.2bn | $3.5bn | $3.4bn | $3.7bn| N/A | N/A|
|Net Revenues | $1.7bn | $1.9bn | $2.1bn | $2.1bn | $2.3bn| $2.4bn | $2.5bn|
|EPS | $2.04 | $2.25 | $2.39 | $2.50 | $0.64| $4.17 | $4.55|
|DPS | $0.39 | $0.52 | $0.58 | $0.90 | $1.21| $1.45 | N/A|

However, what I find a little odd, is they did 3 big acquisitions in 2016 (ISE, Boardvantage and Marketwired), spending $1.5bn, but there is little to show for it, at the top line. Go figure! And I suspect the forecasts have not yet been updated for the announcement in September of the $700m deal to buy eVestment (which does circa $100m of sales).

Also, we need to note: that they love talking about Adjusted Earnings, reversing restructuring charges, impairments etc, to get to a rosier EPS. Gawd, I hate those shenanigans!

## What's with the debt levels?

$NDAQ has $2,896M of net debt. That is 2.5x it's latest operating profit. Okay, part of it's value is an oligopoly business along side ICE/NYSE but I'm starting getting uncomfortable, given that it's debt should rise further, after the eVestment deal. 

Who know when the next bear market is. But after the heady days of 2001, Nasdaq saw sales decline 3 years in a row. Though post 2008, the dip was more muted. In fact, they talk about 75% of sales now being recurring / subscriptions. So, perhaps they've diversified the business sufficiently to weather a storm?

And they think they get back to a reasonable level of debt by 1H 2019. 

## Rewarding shareholders?

$NDAQ pays about 30% of earnings out as dividends, which gives shareholders a 2% yield. They do repurchase stock, a bit, but it's mainly to reward employees. And with the current debt levels, I find it hard to believe there's a substantial buyback round the corner.

# 2. How's it look versus it's peers?

Although it's got the bulk, it's not standing out on margins or returns.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Nasdaq Inc | $3,873M | 30% | 4%
*US players* | | |
Intercontinental Exchange Inc | $4,558M | 63% | 10%
CME Group Inc | $3,609M | 69% | 8%
CBOE Holdings, Inc | $1,328M | 34% | 11%
MarketAxess Holdings Inc. | $386M | 57% | 31%
OTC Markets Group Inc | $53M | 38% | 64%
*Others* | | |
London Stock Exchange Group Plc | £1,657M | 46% | 8%
Deutsche Boerse AG | €2,674M | 52% | 18%
TMX Group Ltd | C$ 804M | 47% | 7%

And if I look at the commentary in the [Investor Deck](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NDAQ/5376633192x0x956503/4BF48AA9-70CC-45EA-A831-3F6F5777E372/NDAQ_Investor_Presentation_SEPTEMBER_2017_FINAL.2.pdf), they talk of mid-single digit organic growth, with a target of double digit shareholder returns. i.e. they'll need to increase margins and do some accretive M&amp;A. 

## And the price?

But all this translates into a rather unaggressive valuation, at least versus the behemoths at ICE/NYSE or the CME Group. Are those folks really in a better place strategically? 

I have to look at the Toronto Stock Exchange to find a cheaper exchange!

# 3. Wall Street isn't convinced

Well I suppose the professionals on Wall Street are the ultimate insiders in the case of stock exchanges! So it's not encouraging to see a _Hold_ recommendation and a consensus target of $80, i.e. just 5% above the current price.

That dis-interest is despite the company meeting or beating expectations every quarter for the last 3 years. 

# 4. Trading

The stock's traded between 16 and 19 times earnings the last 2 years. Seen a steady rise of all it's metrics and been focused on sensible M&amp;A. Yes, it's a quality stock, good value relative to the other players, with a sensible strategy to create value. 

But, exchanges are one of the ultimate beta plays. And we are closer to the end of the cycle that the start. Of course it can move higher from here, but I don't see how it's valuation gets re-rated or it accelerates earnings. 

So I think I'll place my trade elsewhere, ignoring the home of the FAANGs.

49,2017-10-11,shane_stockflare,38,stockAday: I wont 'av' a go at Broadcom $AVGO,"Broadcom's a regular request at stockAday, and since we've not written on it since December, let's do a recap!

Back then we suggested we should all be [Rolling up with Broadcom $AVGO](https://www.reddit.com/r/stockaday/comments/5g4xft/rolling_up_with_broadcom_avgo/). Concluding:

&gt; So given the potential revenues and cost synergies, still to gain from the original merger and now Brocade...I have to admit to be tempted...especially since it's traded between 12 and 16x and today it's in the middle of the range.

# 1. So what's changed?

The fundamentals have ramped, as we move forward a year, the stock and target have jumped, and despite all that, the increase in the valuation has been modest. Nice.

|$AVGO|December|today|change|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|

|EPS forecast | $11.25 | $15.91 | +40% | 
|PE ratio | 14x | 16x | +15% | 

## A quick aside

Though before we move on let's not forget the basic stats and links.

# 2. What's this star?

It's one of the largest semi-conductor companies out there, and it's really a roll-up of Avago, Broadcom and soon, Brocade. 

It's got 4 divisions, though as you'll see the first three are the bulk of the value.

* Wired Infrastructure (50% of sales);
* Wireless Communications (28%);
* Enterprise Storage (17%), and;
* Industrial &amp; Other (5%).

And if you are wondering what all that means, their chips end up in data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband &amp; telecommunication equipment, smartphones, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Yeah, you're very likely to be using Broadcom kit.

A year ago, when they were talking about the Brocade deal they talked about adding $1.4bn of sales with the revenues of $AVGO growing 5% per annum with a little margin upside. The product mix is expected to change a little, with Brocade adding to the Enterprise Storage unit. 

## Shooting higher?

These figures are including the big M&amp;A deals, so it's not organic growth, sadly...

|Oct year-end|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $2.3bn | $2.5bn | $4.3bn | $6.8bn | $13.2bn| $17.6bn | $19.2bn|
|EPS | $2.25 | $2.19 | $0.99 | $4.85 | $-4.86| $15.91 | $17.61|
|DPS | $0.56 | $0.80 | $1.13 | $1.55 | $1.96| $4.06 | N/A|

In fact, it's hard to judge the historical figures at all, especially the year to Oct-2016, as there were considerable non-cash and restructuring charges that hit the bottom line. In fact, the adjusted earnings that year were: $11.30 a share, and everyone seems to ignore the reported EPS. One of those things that annoys me!

## Deal junkies?

Although $AVGO looks like a deal junkie, with $8bn of net debt, that is just 1.2x it's latest operating profit. So it doesn't look like the dividend faces any threat. in fact the forecast dividend of $4.06 compares to a forecast Adjusted EPS of $15.91, so a 25% payout ratio, with the divie doubling year-on-year. 

# 2. Looking good or not?

It's now one of the largest players in the industry and it's got some of the best margins. Okay, this is an industry with lots of consolidation (e.g. QCOM buying NXP) so they need to watch out, but it's not like they don't have scale.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Broadcom Ltd | $16,928M | 40% | 3%
Intel Corporation | $61,711M | 40% | 20%
QUALCOMM, Inc. | $22,570M | 30% | 13%
Texas Instruments Incorporated | $14,184M | 47% | 40%
STMicroelectronics NV (ADR) | $7,401M | 17% | 9%
Qorvo Inc | $2,975M | 26% | -1%
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. | $2,384M | 21% | 6%
Skyworks Solutions Inc | $3,502M | 41% | 26%

When we look at the valuation it's currently 16x which admittedly is at the top of it's 2 year range of 12 to 16x. Compare that to the other giants? INTC is on 13 versus a range of 12 to 16x. And QCOM is on 13x versus a 2 year range of 10 to 16x.

Sure the growth looks a little better at AVGO. But is it sufficiently better to merit a 20% premium in valuation. 

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

AVGO.O | $100,359M | 16x | 18% | 2% | 6%

QRVO.O | $9,143M | 13x | 14% | 0% | 7%
MRVL.O | $9,177M | 16x | 16% | 1% | 5%
SWKS.O | $19,173M | 16x | 15% | 1% | 7%

Is this a sector that's underpriced versus the rest of tech? Hard to tell. Looking at the other mega-cap tech stocks, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, TSMC, well it's a stretch to find anyone or sector consistently over 20x. 

# 3. Wall Street's still in love

The professionals on Wall Street have a $282.88 for Broadcom, that 15% above the current price. So it's no surprise their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. 

It's been a relentless upgrade cycle, every quarter, with the company beating estimates the last 8 quarters straight.

# 4. It's a keeper

The deal to acquire Brocade still hasn't closed, but will do soon, possibly by the end of the month. It's going to grow the business by circa 10% in size, and it's got higher margins than the existing business lines.

But on the 3Q call there were a few things that migh trouble you. For example:

&gt; We operate in a relatively matured end markets that we assume likely to grow over the long-term close to GDP rates or in the low single-digits. Given our strong position for our product franchises, we do not assume market share changes to contribute to our long-term revenue growth.

On top of that they referred to 4Q as a transitional quarter and that they will change the way they give guidence. Change = given less information. 

Now, the forecasts for 2018 don't look agressive, I'll admit. But the mood music is muted. So, I'm not buying the stocks today. I fear there's more chance of being disappointed in the next couple months. The downside isn't huge, fine. But I'm going to look elsewhere for now.

# 1. How's the merged biz going to look?

Here are the highlights:

* Combined company will have nearly 20% of ad-supported pay-TV viewership in the U.S.
* Becomes home to five of the top female networks in ad-supported pay-TV with over 20% share of women watching primetime in the U.S.
* 8,000 hours of original programming annually 
* Over 7 billion monthly streams creates leading short-form, mobile-first digital player

So it's going to be a broadcasting powerhouse in the US, with the Discovery Channel, TLC, Animal Planet, HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, DIY Network, Cooking Channel. And Internationally with Eurosport, TVN in Poland and their JV with the UK's BBC called UK TV.

They've provided some pro-forma financials in the merger document and here's what the figures look like. Though it's a little fishy as 1+1 equals less than 2. Why's the margin get trashed? Weird!

If we look at the forecasts for the two businesses on their own, they've grown steadily, generating good earnings and have been forecast to continue doing so, on a stand alone basis.

|Revenues|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Discovery | $4.5bn | $5.5bn | $6.2bn | $6.4bn | $6.5bn| $6.8bn | $7.2bn|
|Scripps | $2.3bn | $2.5bn | $2.6bn | $2.7bn | $2.9bn| $3.5bn | $3.7bn|

|EPS|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Discovery | $1.24 | $1.49 | $1.66 | $1.58 | $1.96| $2.23 | $2.50|
|Scripps | $4.44 | $3.40 | $3.83 | $4.66 | $5.18| $5.51 | $5.49|

With that in mind, I can only assume the brokers on Wall Street will be equally happy when the two companies become one. On top of that the manage has said:

&gt; Significant cost synergies estimated at approximately $350 million (i.e. less than 10% of costs)
&gt; Expected to be accretive to Adjusted Earnings per Share and Free Cash Flow in first year after close
&gt; 50% of synergies achievable by end 2018, 100% by end of 2019

So perhaps there will be some _merger_ costs that eat into earnings in 2018, but it sounds like it's back to business ASAP! And we could see margins jump from 31-32% to as high as 35%. Nice.

# 3. Should we worry about the debt?

Given there is a big cash payment to SNI shareholders, the debt levels are going to rocket :( Discovery is forecasting Total debt to profit of 4.8x on closing, and that it'll take 2 years to get to a more manageable 3.5x. 

They don't pay dividends, and they won't do any buybacks in the near term, until the debt level is lower. So yes, it's higher than I'd like, but they've got a plan to get it to a reasonable level.

# 4. Still a minnow in media?

Okay, it's big talk saying they'll be the biggest ""ad-supported"" broadcaster in the US. In reality there are a lot of mega firms above them. Perhaps CBS and AMC are the closest in profile? 

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Discovery Communications Inc. | $6,586M | 63% | 14%
Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. | $3,472M | 41% | 29%
Comcast Corporation | $83,972M | 33% | 18%
Walt Disney Co | $55,500M | 30% | 21%
Charter Communications Inc | $40,833M | 37% | 2%
Time Warner Inc | $30,123M | 28% | 17%
DISH Network Corp | $14,794M | 21% | 24%
CBS Corporation | $12,630M | 23% | 38%
Viacom, Inc. | $13,170M | 21% | 31%
AMC Networks Inc | $2,795M | 63% | 555%

When it comes to valuation, we can probably assume the figures of New Discovery aren't going to be far off the figures of old Discovery. So 10 times earnings feels about right.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
DISCA.O | $7,979M | 10x | 12% | 0% | 11%
SNI.O | $11,200M | 16x | 7% | 1% | 10%
CMCSA.O | $181,889M | 19x | 9% | 2% | 12%
DIS | $155,197M | 17x | 7% | 2% | 9%
CHTR.O | $110,553M | 94x | 15% | 0% | 11%
TWX | $80,502M | 17x | 10% | 2% | 8%
DISH.O | $25,212M | 24x | -1% | 0% | 7%
CBS | $24,104M | 13x | 16% | 1% | 8%
VIAB.O | $11,732M | 7x | 6% | 3% | 18%
AMCX.O | $3,821M | 9x | 11% | 0% | 32%

That's not far off AMC and a nice discount to CBS. Though clearly these folks are a poor also ran to the big boys. 

# 5. Failing to excite Wall Street!

So despite good logic to the deal, nice growth both revenues and earnings, and an unaggressive valuation, the boys and girls on Wall Street just don't care. 

They say _Hold_, even though they see 20% upside to their price target of $25.55. It really seems unfair. Okay, DISCA has disappointed on earnings multiple times the last 2 years, but Scripps has managed expectations well. But with the valuation anything but aggressive and a nice plan in place... is the lack of enthusiasm justified?

# 6. A tedious formula to the merger

Perhaps the problem is the complex structure of the deal? An SNI shareholder is supposed to get $63 in cash and $27 in stock. Though if the Discovery price falls a lot, the Scripps shareholders may be a little more cash / a little less shares. The details are in the merger document but clearly create some uncertainty.

And if you are worried the deal might not happen, the merger document has a curious discussion about other companies both telecoms and media approaching Scripps. :) I wonder who there were... and now that they didn't _get_ it, what they are sniffing around!

# 7. Are there enough catalysts?

I'm tempted to say yes! 

* Their content strategy looks good: Ad funded; Subscriptions; Short Form. Ensuring they generate value regardless of the screen size.
* They still have room to grow internationally
* Margins can grow
* The media business is still a cash machine, in a good economy


Though we need to remember, all the benefits of the merger can't start until the deal is done! And that's not expected until early next year.

Okay, they don't make hits like _Frozen_ or _Game of Thrones_ but who cares, I don't want my stocks to entertain me. ;)

Sure, the stock may be stuck at the $22 level for the next 2 quarters, as the deal closing approached. But if I'm a fan, maybe it's time to buy a little Discovery. Or go crazy, and split the funds between the two stocks. 


Though please remember there are 3 types of stock Discovery stock... with the most liquid one having no voting right. :( Gawd I hate that sort of tomfoolery.

51,2017-10-02,shane_stockflare,14,stockAday: is PureStorage Flash Gordon or a flash in the pan? $PSTG,"What could be simpler than a storage business? No not self-storage containers on the edge of town, but storage of data for companies. IPOed at $17 two years ago, Pure Storage is still under water. Should we tread carefully?

# Key Stats
|Ticker|[PSTG](https://stockflare.com/stock/pstg.k)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Storage Devices
Latest price | $15.99
Value | $3,382M
Daily vol | $32M
Date | 02 October 2017
Financials | [SEC Filings](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001474432&amp;type=10&amp;dateb=&amp;owner=exclude&amp;count=40)
Website | [purestorage.com](https://www.purestorage.com/)

# 1. What's so great about Flash?

Pure Storage is focused on delivering software-defined all-flash solutions that are fast and cloud-capable for customers, enabling customers to put data to work for their businesses. 

Now that sounds a bit complicated, doesn't it. And why is flash memory so much better than hard disks? Here's their _pitch_ from their IPO:

&gt; Our business model builds on our technology innovations to reverse the traditional storage business model. Instead of moving data between old and new systems via forklift upgrades, we keep business data and applications in place and upgrade technology around it. Our platform and business model are designed to add value to customers for a decade or more, reducing total cost of storage ownership while increasing loyalty. 

Sorry, but that is still gobbledygook to me. And it didn't get any easier, the more I read.

Still they must be doing something right, as they've over 3,700 customers including 25% of the Fortune 500. Though watch out, they note that it's a ""high touch"" sales model. I expect it has to be if you are selling million dollar critical storage infrastructure to big corporates!

# 2. How's it working out?

The growth until the January 2016 was remarkable, with sales accelerating. But the year to Jan 2017, and the forecasts for this year, show a market slowdown. Now, adding $300m a year is brilliant, don't misunderstand me, it's just that it's not _stellar_! And it's not long before Wall Street things they'll turn a profit. 

|January|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017A|2018E|2019E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $6m | $43m | $174m | $440m | $728m| $1,010m | $1,317m|
|EPS | N/A | N/A | $-6.56 | $-2.59 | $-1.26| $-0.21 | $+0.04|

On top of that with $523M of net cash, (15% of the market value) the company has some room, in case of hiccups. Separately, they don't pay a dividend, as it's growth model.

However, I am a little concerned by the long-term expectations. Here's how they [see margins](https://s21.q4cdn.com/687136699/files/doc_financials/presentations/Earning-Slides-(Q2-FY18)_FINAL.pdf) on page 15 of their July Quarter presentation.

|as % of sales|Last Quarter | Long Term|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
Gross margin | 67% | 63 to 68%|
R&amp;D costs | 23% | 15 to 20%|
Sales costs | 49% | 25 to 30%|
General costs | 8% | 5 to 7%|
Operating margin | -12% | 15 to 20%|

They'd have to half marketing to get to a reasonable profit. Which seems an aggressive assumption. Sure, they've grown revenue faster than costs the last 3 years, but there's no evidence they can get to that target yet.  

# 3. How do they compare?

It's hard to find a reasonable group of competitors. There are tiny companies like Quantum and Tintri. Firms like NetApp who bought into the market. Legacy firms like Seagate and Western Digital. And some big-boys like Dell, HP, IBM, and Hitachi.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Pure Storage Inc | $832M | -19% | -51%
Quantum Corp | $506M | 4% | N/A
Tintri Inc | $140M | -84% | N/A
NetApp Inc. | $5,550M | 18% | 21%
Western Digital Corp | $19,093M | 23% | 4%
Seagate Technology PLC | $10,771M | 18% | 52%

And if you are wondering about the big-boys... when talking about the competition, they note:

&gt; The acquisitions of EMC by Dell, Nimble Storage by HP Enterprise and SolidFire by NetApp have introduced new competitive dynamics into the storage market. 

Excuse me if I find that ominous.

# 4. Struggling with the valuation

It's never easy to hang my hat on a loss-making business. :( Especially a high grower. And in the case of $PSTG even the sales multiple is way ahead of the entire group.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|Price to Sales|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
PSTG.K | $3,382M | -74x | 40% | 0% | 3.4x
QTM | $211M | 13x | 20% | 0% | 0.6x
TNTR.O | $98M | -1x | N/A | 0% | 0.6x
NTAP.O | $11,805M | 14x | 16% | 2% | 1.6x
WDC.O | $25,503M | 7x | 26% | 2% | 1.7x
STX.O | $9,547M | 9x | 22% | 8% | 1.1x

If I want to be generous, I do a back of the envelope, cash flow analysis. Say they grow sales by $300m every year, at a 20% margin and pay a 25% tax rate. That would yield an extra $45m of cash a year. Discount that over the next 30 years at 8%, add in the cash in the bank and I get to $23 a share. Though warning... tweak the assumptions and blow up the result.

# 5. Has Wall Street given up?

The loyal brokers of Wall Street that IPOed the business 2 years ago, still say _Buy_. Though they've cut their target from $22 a share at the IPO to $16. Gawd... that's where the stock is.

What's a little weird is that the company has beaten earnings and sales forecasts every quarter since the IPO. And that's not driven the stock up. 

Though in August the company appointed a new CEO, Charles Giancarlo, which has lead to increased optimism. He was a key man at Cisco, then went on to be a venture capitalist. He's on the board of Accenture, Arista and ServiceNow. So nicely connected!

# 6. Flash Gordon or flash in the pan? 

I hate buying stocks when I don't really understand what their edge is. Is $PSTG growing fast because it's a great solution at a reasonable price? O is the price too cheap? Meaning they can never really generate much cashflow? I just can't tell.

But what I can see, is that sales aren't accelerating. They are growing fast, but if I'm looking for a moon-shot, it has to show that sales are going to go exponential. No sign here... yet.

Perhaps the game here is M&amp;A, that the new CEO will dress it up for sale. But I'd prefer to invest on fundamentals, not hope. 

For now, I'm not storing my cash in $PSTG.

52,2017-11-10,ChocolateTsar,4,Bank of America/Merrill Lynch says stock market fall 'not the Big One',"&gt;Investors poured a record $1.3 billion into funds managing tech shares over the past week, contrasting with a picture of ebbing inflow into world equity vehicles and losses on U.S. stock funds, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch (BAML) said on Friday.

&gt;The data, which tracks flows through Wednesday, also showed some alarm over junk debt, with some $600 million in outflows from high-yield bond funds, an eight-week high.

&gt;World stocks are witnessing their second day of losses, albeit after the longest daily winning streak in almost 11 years. A 0.4 percent pullback in U.S. tech shares on Thursday came after a 40 percent jump in 2017 alone.

&gt;**""The recent pullback is a 'dress rehearsal' not the Big One,"" BAML told clients, noting the fall had been preceded by ""insane gains"" which had pushed for instance the value of U.S. tech firms and their U.S.-listed Chinese peers past the entire market capitalization of Germany's DAX index.** (*my emphasis*)

53,2017-11-09,VCRtapes,4,HRTX thoughts?,"Interested to hear from people who are genuinely excited about HRTX. Obviously PDUFA going to give it a little pop, but I'm otherwise so indifferent to this stock. Think it has potential, but I have strong concerns about financials and innovation. Approval of Cinvanti was basically a given since it was filed as 505(b)(2).

I don’t necessarily think approval of Cinvanti does much for Heron, and I don't think it will move the stock much other than the reactionary jump correlative to approval news. Big movement will likely depend on continued success of Sustol and positive Phase 3 trials of HTX-011. Positive trial results could make this stock a good value, but overall you’re looking at a lot of potential for volatility in 2018. A few thoughts--

Will HRTX run out of money? (Maybe a stupid question since these pharma companies never seem to).. If they can't secure more debt financing upon the expiration of promissory notes in 2018, you’re almost certainly looking at dilution. They won't be profitable for several years to come, and with a ~$720M deficit on the balance sheet I think it will be hard for them to raise capital. (Although it looks like they're doing a good job paying down the notes they owe, so who knows.) They need to expand their product pipeline or achieve standard-of-care status for at least one of their existing products to convince anyone to give them more money. Could easily see this stock going the way of DXTR if they hit major speed bumps in early 2018.

Will Sustol sales be enough to sustain HRTX through Phase 3 trials, NDA submission / review, and subsequent marketing challenges of HTX-011? Phase 3 trials will likely conclude in late Q2 2018. Depending on those results, they could submit NDA in Q3. FDA has 60 days to respond. Assuming everything goes smoothly-- even taking fast track designation into consideration-- you're looking at early 2019 for marketability for HTX-011.

Sustol's biggest competitor is Aloxi. When Sustol was approved, FDA rejected superiority labeling over Aloxi, which could have effectively caused it to replace Aloxi as standard-of-care. Because Sustol lacks significant clinical advantages over Aloxi, there will be little motivation for healthcare providers to prescribe Sustol over the generic of Aloxi or for health insurance companies to provide reimbursement for Sustol over the generic of Aloxi. This could cause major problems with marketing HTX-011. Without cashflow from Sustol (and still burning cash trying to gain market penetration with Cinvanti), you're again looking at either dilution or additional pre-revenue debt financing to even start trying to market HTX-011.

HTX-011's Phase 2 trial results don't make me super confident that the drug's efficacy improvements are enough for it to replace the current standard-of-care drug, bupivacaine. The only published results I've been able to find are the ones on HRTX's website (in presentation form). Without seeing unaltered non-condensed trial data, I can't tell. When raw data from Phase 2 trials are released I'll reevaluate. 

From an investment standpoint, Heron's problem (which seems common among cancer drug companies) is that both Sustol and Cinvanti provide, at best, marginal improvements to the existing standard-of-care drugs on the market. You're talking about millions and millions on R&amp;D, trials, and marketing for drugs that essentially MAY eliminate one side effect. The innovations don't excite me in the way Trulance and setmelanotide (RYTM) did/do, but I'm interested in opinions to the contrary.

54,2017-11-07,azzazaz,4,I have noticed a MASSIVE takeover of shelf space in large grocery chains like Kroger for their own low cost food brands outselling and now displacing major name brands completely. Expected effect on General Mills and other large brand name foods profits?,"This has happened massively in the last year.

More so in the last 5 or 6 months.

Campbells soups now half their specific choices gone as kroger brandss take over half of their former shelf space.

Planters nuts choices almost completely replaced by low cost kroger nuts.

Real lemon brand lemon juice now completely gone as kroger brand takes over.

Cereal aisle devasted as kroger raisin bran sell for $1.xx vs $2 or 4 for Post and Kellogs etc. And every major cereal type being replaced. Cheerios, frosted miniwheats, cocoa puffs..all have replacement kroger brand which are clealry outselling the old names (often sold out). Half of shelf now gone to kroger brands. Now noticing major brands lower prices so also losing margin on the shelf space they still have.

This is throughout every shelf in the store.

I dont know of this has shown up yet in quarterly reports.

Its got to be devasting.

What do people think?

Who is vulenrable.

I know many kroger brands are packaged/manufactured by big food packers/manufacturers  that do the name brands so they may or may not be affected but certainly the brand name is.

This is the biggest challenge to major food name brands i have ever seen.

Literally the grocery store shelves are cut in half or actually to about 1/4 for major brands and now they are also depricing their name brands to try to compete with the shelf space they have left.

And based on what i see sold out and conversations with store employees stocking shelves this is a huge sea change.

Editm

Other shelves affected for example with about half of shelf space now taken over by lower cost kroger brands

Canned beans   baked beans

Canned meats  ie tuna veinna sausages corned beef hash etc


Colas. Bye bye most of shelf space for coca cola and pepsi cola. Literally lessthan hakf of shelf space now as kroger has no name version of every variety cola and moujtizn dew including diet and diet cherry and diet black cherry. At $0.77 per 2 liter bottle people are buying so much diet kroger cola that they cant keep it stocked.

Of course vitamins have had this for some time.


Clealry kroger has made thestrategic change to make a larger more or higher vume sales of their own lower cost food products than relyon margin and shelf payments from large name brands as kroger is now directly competing with their former partenrs/retail food sjppliers like generzl mills.

Only way out i see for giant food brands is an attempted take over of a grocery chain to ensure their products survival at current levels.

The question is who is bigger and can the smaller one do a leveraged buyou5?

Also Kroger owns Ralphs.


what i see is with walmart and now mazon/whole foods in a price race for marketshare there is no more room in the grocery store market share battle for high prices name brand grocery products that consumers no longer are forced to buy.

it hurts kroger margins and same store sales now but in the end the losers are the giant name brands that used to be able to command premium consumer prices that will no longer have many places to sell their high priced goods that consumers no longer want.

proof is staring toshow

&gt;Slumping yogurt, cereal sales spoil General Mills' performance
Nathan Bomey, USA TODAY Published 8:18 a.m. ET Sept. 20, 2017 | Updated 2:23 p.m. ET Sept. 20, 2017

Plummeting yogurt sales continued to spoil the performance of General Mills, which is also reeling from declining interest in cereal and snacks.

As consumer tastes shift away from packaged foods and toward more natural products, General Mills sales are suffering despite the company's efforts to freshen its image with younger consumers by removing artificial colors and flavors from its products.

General Mills saw a decline in the ""double-digits"" for U.S. sales of yogurt, including decreases for the Yoplait Light brand.
U.S. cereal sales also fell 7%, as Americans are increasingly giving up the former breakfast staple.


yeah i suspect its a lot more than yogurt and no they arent giving up cereal. just overpriced cereal.


edit:

looks like they are implementing machine learningAI to change their shelf spaces

yeah 8 ft per category is about what it looks like in the stores

Machine Learning: Kroger Connects the Shopper and Supply Chain
By Keith Scovell October 31, 2017 0 Comments 1292

For consumer goods manufacturers and retailers, machine learning can be a powerful ally.

Just ask Kroger. The supermarket giant’s sweeping “Restock” initiative is a perfect case study in how to put data science to use. Kroger is doubling down on this initiative and increasing capital expenditures over the next three years to over $3 billion. The “Restock” strategic initiative calls for integrating machine learning with other technology components to deliver a seamless personal experience and optimize space at the store level. Kroger’s plans call for touching 20% to 30% of Kroger’s 2,800+ stores in 2018 and upwards to 75% of in-store categories changing on average 8 feet of shelving per category all while reducing cost of in-store operations.

55,2017-11-05,skuggic,1,"ELI5 - What does ""accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock"" mean?","I am trying to do some due diligence on Redfin (RDFN), but something big sticks out in their S-1 and 10Q that I don't understand.

On the income statement, it shows something called ""Accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock"".

This is listed as a loss of 111 million on their last 10Q, making it look like they had a huge loss. However, their net income is listed as positive at 4.3 million.

10Q: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1382821/000138282117000007/redfin6301710-q.htm

Can someone explain what this means and what implication it has for this stock as an investment?"
56,2017-12-31,Tiancius,337,Equity Vs Real Estate,"Working in investments, it was always surprising to me that there is no strong consensus among professionals on the financial merits of home ownership. I was taught early on that home ownership was a lifestyle choice, and usually a bad financial choice. So buy one if you want to own a house, not because it's a good investment. This made sense to me, since home ownership goes against a lot of the conventional wisdom of investing (active, leveraged, not diversified, negative cash flow, low risk/return profile, etc.).


But I also regularly meet financial analysts, portfolio managers, and CFOs that love home ownership over stocks as an investment. These are generally well educated financial professionals, so I assume they have a reason for thinking this. When I bring up the conventional arguments, they'll counter with points about tax benefits and the leverage being relatively cheap and actually a good thing. That's usually where the conversation ends, because neither of us will have the numbers to back up the economic value of the leverage and tax benefits, so we just end up agreeing that ""it depends"".


So I did a deep dive analysis myself. The St. Louis Fed provides housing price and mortgage data from 1975. On a pure return basis, there's no question that equity dominates housing over that time period. The SP500 total return is 13,114%, or 12.0% annualized. US housing is 675% or 4.5% annualized. However, making some adjustments for leverage and tax, the difference is much smaller. SP500 is 10,923% or 11.5% annualized, and housing is 3,571% or 8.7% annualized. (See Edit 3.)


This is a small enough delta that I can now see how there are plenty of specific personal situations that would push housing above equity as a preferred asset class. On average, stocks are probably better, but for some people, housing might be. ""It depends"" is actually a very accurate answer. As an example, I did the same for California housing specifically, and it came out to 9,131% or 11.1% annualized. Just one change and already housing has almost caught up to stocks on an absolute return basis.


Anyway, thought this might be a question some of you have also been meaning to look into, and just haven't had the time. In addition to sharing, I also wanted to put my calculation out there for critique. I know there are major simplifying assumptions I've made, including a mortgage that fluctuates based on housing value, multiple instances of straight line averaging instead of compounding, mixing historical and current data, heavy use of midpoint averaging, etc. but I'm wondering if any of my assumptions are a big enough distortion to render the analysis grossly inaccurate.


Spreadsheet link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oim4RGz-v8PUogTaQgDdc-rQDmjv-DPYi3i1xdFwvMk/edit?usp=sharing

EDIT: Wow I just realized I missed a major factor. This analysis ignores rent entirely. Maybe I'll take another crack at it tomorrow morning. (Or someone else can using the spreadsheet.)

EDIT 2: Rent might not be as big a deal as I thought. Gross rental yield is maybe around 2.9%, and average property tax is 1.2%. Add on all the other home ownership costs like maintenance and repairs and the net rental yield may actually be much lower than I thought.

EDIT 3: Just woke up. Adding net rental yield is harder than I thought. I'm using 9% gross, from ATTOM's 2017 single family rentals report (much higher than the 2.9% I googled last night). Then I'm using 5% as an estimate for net tax + insurance + maintenance/repairs. This is just based on my personal experience, and I would love to replace this number with a more reliable one from some kind of national report. Adding on an extra 4% per year from rental yield, the adjusted national housing return actually tops out the equity return, 17,654% or 12.8% annualized. Big difference."
