Except for FB, Ive been watching all these. I dont know much about FB's acquisitions. Oculus VR, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the 50 some others over the past years... I know of them, but Im not much other than topical information. I dont like FB as an investment because I think it will dwindle in use a la MySpace, though I dont have anything to substantiate that.  

I like Amazon and Netflix because I use both frequently and want them to succeed. They both have big plans for expansion and seem like good investments at currently low prices. 

It seems like Apple is losing its share of the phone market and I personally feel like its products are overvalued, but many other people would likely disagree with that. (As I type this on my iPhone.)

Then the ubiquitous Google, the company so well known, their name has become a verb. They have so many projects and are involved in so many tech facets that they will almost certainly be around for a long time. 

I know Ive stated a lot of preferential bias for and against, which is probably not the ideal mindset for an investor. So, those of you with more knowledge, tell me what you think about these companies. Or another way to phrase the question, if you had X dollars to invest in these 5, what percent would you allocate to each (0 is of course acceptable)?

I know about ira investments, but I don't want to use this for that so don't feel obligated to talk me into doing that.

---

I want to invest in something that has a shot at hitting it big time.  Ideally something that I could make back 10x the investment in 5 years.  I understand the risk and that I could lose all 10k and I am OK with that.

My first instinct is VR so maybe a company like Facebook or Google.  Google has a [27% growth projection](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fb/earnings-growth) in 5 years.  At least I think that is what this site says.  Anyone know how accurate this is?

Google is listed at [17% growth](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/goog/earnings-growth) for 5 years.

Would either of these be good investments?  What are brokerage fees like?  How much of my 10k would I actually be able to invest and how much should I expect to be paying someone?  

Love the sub.  Thanks for any advice.

3,2016-01-07,Snoutnosedpugg,1,Nvidia a good stock with Occulus Rift taking orders?,"Hey Everyone,

I was interested in your opinions on Nvidia Corp (NVDA) ? .

Personally I'm a big believer in the Occulus Rift . I believe its use in gaming as well as Porn (no really) will be huge.

The system requirements of the occulus rift are very demanding requiring a high end graphics card which Nvidia (as well as AMD) dominate the market.

Nvidia has partnered up with PC and notebook manufactures to have ""VR"" ready pc's and laptops to make it easier for consumers to select a powerful enough device.

""The graphics card shouldn't be less powerful than the Nvidia GTX 970 or the AMD R9290"" to quote

Thoughts?

(apologies if I broke any /investing rules , I dont think I have)

4,2016-01-06,Keshipel,0,"HTC Vive booth, huge potential","As HTC has said the price of the Vive will be more expensive than the Oculus (Oculus at 599$), I'm thinking investing in a VR booth is a great idea. Until the market can drive those ridicilous prices down, your average Joe won't be able to afford it, but I'm pretty sure he still wants to try one! 

Now, I've not done the math, and comparing prices where I live (Scandinavia) vs USA wouldn't be reasonable. 

**But** let's just say, 5$ for 5 min, 9$ for 10 min, and 17,5$ for 20 min would be fair, right? Here I've taken into account *some* of the costs like: 

* Renting a place to have the booth
* Cost of the Vive, PC, monitors, cables etc.
* Cost for beverages to the people that wait in line
* The extra people I'll have to hire

----------------------------------

So let's just say it explodes on day 1. Tons of people come in, it's open for 12 hours, and people are constantly in the booth. 
They also can't be inside for longer than 20 min (I'm still assuming they haven't got 100% rid of motion sickness). 

So for easy of math, we'll say they *all* took the 10 min for 9$. 

* 9x6 = 54 x 12 = 648$.

Let's also say half of them buy some soda, for 2,22$ (yeah that's cheap here actually) 

* 2,22$ x 27 = 60$. 

And someone probably bought some chocolate aswell so let's throw in another 20$. 

---------------------------------

That would amount up too 728$. And that's only with **one** booth. It would make the most sense to have at least two. So let's just double that number. 1456$ and since there's more people, more buy beverages and chocolate aswell. 

1500$ the first day earned, and since I was smart and had a friend/family member help me out, I only pay'em 50$ for a days work. They agree to work for another week aswell, if I pay'em 100$ per day. 

The next 4 days goes just aswell and people keep coming in as they've heard about the booth. So in 5 days I've earned 7500$ minus 450$ for the friend helping me out. That amounts to 7050$ which is about the same a Norwegian oil worker earns on an rig after 2 weeks. Only that I earned it in 5 days. 


----------------------------------

So what am I saying? There's potential. 

Or does this all sound like fantasy? I think it sounds about right, and I've got great confidence in VR. 

If anyone has anything to contribute with, that'd be great :) "

VR gaming should be a big hit. Looks like they are coming this fall:

Sony is a well known respectable brand. I take a look at their max chart and they're rock solid. If you take into account the dot com boom, financial crisis of 2008, Tsunami of 2011, they've been pretty rock solid in terms of shareholder performance. 

http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SNE+Interactive#{""range"":""max"",""allowChartStacking"":true}

So with that being said, with VR on the horizon, would you say Sony could be a bargain right now at it's current price? You have Oculus which will either be over $500 and require a great CPU or the $1500 package which is pretty expensive right now given the state of the world economy. Gear VR has a controller but most of those games won't come close to what Sony has with the PS4.

-------------------------
###Background
Headquartered in **Santa Clara California** and employing **9100** **employees** worldwide Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market, as well as system on a chip units for the automotive market. Primary GPU product line:""GeForce"", is in direct competition with AMD's ""Radeon"" .

**Focus on: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Centers and Auto.**


In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers  efficiently run high-performance applications. Deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved out of the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. 

**In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.**

#$NVDA REPORT

###Capitalization

*Sector | Industry*: **Tech  | Semiconductors**

*Price as of Post* |  *YTD%*: **$45.70** | **43.43 %**

*Market Cap*:  **23.67B** : *Large Cap*

###Revenue, Profits, Margins (FY11 - FY16)
Revenue Trend: 3.54B --&gt; 5.01B = **+41.5%**

Earnings: 343M --&gt; 780M = **+127%**

Net Margin: 10% --&gt; 15% = **+50%**

Gross Margin: 44% --&gt; 56% = **+27%**

Revenue continues to grow, with earnings growth outpacing revenue growth showing good cost cutting and efficiency within, however OpProfit margin &lt;25% so still room for improvement in this regard, dominance over comp AMD in the GPU market with customers highly choosing NVDA over AMD so solid source of cash flows that will continue for foreseeable future, in addition to branching out to automotive tech and research based processors as well as a good foot in the VR door. NVDA will continue to increase its revenue in the near-mid future. 

###Comps

Up against AMD in the GPU market, have dominantly stolen market share from AMD and continues to take customers from the struggling company, **has gone from 62% share to 82%** in the GPU market since 2011, ADM on brink of collapse/bought out so in the core GPU market NVDA is very strong. $INTC and $QCOM are other comps but the other 2 don't really go head to head with NVDA has they focus on the CPU market vs NVDA's GPU base. **TLDR: RIP AMD**

###Multiples
* **P/E**: **41.83** *pretty high* *note: that '17-'18 ests come in around 30, '16 was a really good year for NVDA* : **INTC and QCOM both have P/E of 12-14 then of course AMD has -6**. Could be a good sign that investors expecting more growth in the company but could also mean company overpriced *(as we will see later this is **by my math* false)*. Could also be sign that INTC and QCOM underpriced, etc

* **P/B: 5.57:  INTC's = 2.42 QCOM=2.77** AMD = N/A ::SSDD as above

* **Entreprise Multiple: (EV/EBITDA) : 17.15**|| INTC: 6.88 , QCOM: 9.40 |||||So again NVDA leads the way and SSDD reasons as above, no one knows for sure (welcome to finance)||||| For valuation purposes EV/EBITDA range of 13-15x used has older companies begin to get lower EM's has keeping constant EM's become unsustainable.

###Management and Ownership

* 5% Insider
* 88% Institutional
* 7% us individual peasants

**CEO, President and Co-Founder ^(^^what ^^a ^^big ^^boi) : Jen-Hsun Huang** : founded NVDA in 1993, holds 7300 patent assets fundamental to modern computing, invented the GPU in 1999. Been with the company his whole life obviously and knows what the fuck he's doing clearly even if he has no experience elsewhere (other BOD hacks can cover this) Holds multiple awards regarding innovation, yadda yadda, guy has led this company to success so I see no wrong here and no negative

 **Co-founder: Chris A. Malachowsky**: 30 years industry EXP, key figure in the path the company goes down, has led numerous departments throughout his time with Nvidia like stated above Malachowsky has exp at HP (rip Fiorina) and Sun Microsystems so he has that outside edge that the CEO doesn't. Also won some Emmy in 2009??? So good for him I guess


**VP and CFO: Colette Kress** : Joined in 2013 after 25 years of xp at other tech companies (mirin). Including CFO at Cisco and CFO of MSFTs ""Server and Tools"" divison. Prior to that was at TI in a variety of roles. This girl living the dream (couldve went somewhere else for her MBA but whatcha gonna do now)

3 other BOD members but they all hold similar xp and shit

###10K Notes

NVDA 2016-10K Notes

* GeForce = #1 PC gaming platform: 2.8B +37% 77M users

* Quadro = #1 design platform 78% mrkt share

* DRIVE PX: self driving platform (70 corps using NVDAs tech)

* ITC ruled in fav of Samsung regarding patent suit

* Exited mobile market

*  Stopped building modems

* VR gonna fuck your shit up fams

###Stock History (here's where we start to go south...)

*No preffered shares*

Stock chilling at 45.75 when I began writing this 45.8 right now. As we have all seen it has completely dominated this year and as we will see later is basically at the margin of error for fair value right now. This thing was a steal a few months ago but right now you have no guarantee of gains, this will be a buy the dip kind of stock.


###Expectations

The high analyst estimate is $50 (they have 1 year timeframes), I'm getting $51 with a very conservative estimates for intrinsic value based on current figures. You can still squeeze out 5-10% perhaps on this stock but is by now means a YOLO, unless you want to delve into some &lt;monthly all or nothing 50C play. Average estimate is where the stock is right now. 

###Risks

AMD makes a miraculous comeback (lol)

The more serious one is that VR doesn't do as well as people are thinking. Even with my conservative figures VR has to at least do ""ok"" for NVDA to grow at all. VR could make or break a play on NVDA, outlook looks good but this could become the next fad for all we know. 

### Conclusion

NVDA is a buy/hold, not a sell by no means, but also not a strong buy, as I will presented in my figures above it has 5-15% upside to it with 15% being really optimistic.

The company is strong and doing well, so go ahead and allocate 2%  (or 200% because what's the point to life without margin) of your portfolio towards NVDA, I myself am picking up at a Jan17 ATM call spread on the stock.

##Wait for a dip to buy in because it's not going much higher if at all 

Hope you guys enjoyed, week got busy af and I counted my chickens before they hatched so this was the most thorough one I got around to doing but will make my way through the list as I can.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Executive Summary**

Apple Inc. was founded more than 40 years ago and has experienced tremendous growth. They began by developing and manufacturing personal computers and have grown into one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. With great success comes great expectations, and investors have a tendency to punish Apple (AAPL) if they don’t significantly beat expectations. They are currently trading 28% below its 52 week high.

This paper will discuss their 2016 Q2 results, interpret their financials, explain their different revenue streams, discuss their future direction, and will recommend a buy, sell, or hold recommendation. There are many people that will tell you that Apple is a one-trick-pony, that if their iPhone sales slowdown, they will fall just like tech companies of the past have. The bears like to compare Apple to other historical models like Blackberry, IBM, or Microsoft. These historical models suggest that Apple cannot retain their large growth forever and will eventually slow as their innovation and sales stagnate. 

Earlier this week, on April 16, 2016, Apple posted its first quarterly loss in more than 13 years. This can be attributed to economic factors in China, slowing iPhone sales, and a slightly weaker gross profit margin. The strong dollar is a major reason why Apple didn’t meet revenue expectations, as the majority of their weakness is in Hong Kong. iPhone sales were also down from a year ago in Q2 2015. While many analysts think Apple is a cyclical company that relies solely on their iPhone sales, I will explain throughout this paper why Apple is much more than simply the iPhone. With $50.6B in revenues, an EPS of $1.90, and a P/E of 10.08, Apple is a strong buy at $94.83 a share.      

**Article Summary**

In an article published on April 26, 2016, the New York Times reports Apple’s Q2 results and suggests reasons why Apple missed earnings expectations for the first time in over a decade. “The technology company’s dazzling 13-year run of quarterly revenue growth ended on Tuesday 
— a casualty of Apple’s already immense size, weakness in key global markets like China and 
the lack of another hot product to pry open the wallets of customers” (Goel, 2016). While the 
article provides the raw data from the earnings results, the author also projects a bearish sentiment to it. “Nearly half of the smartphones sold in the United States are iPhones, and Apple may be reaching the saturation point among potential customers in other developed countries” (Goel, 2016). It should be noted that this is mere speculation. Although Apple owns over half of the smartphone market here in the US, Apple is still expanding into emerging markets. Apples dominance will continue to chip away at the Android market and bring new customers into their ecosystem. The article points out Apple’s revenue decline from one year ago, “declined 13 percent to $50.6 billion as sales of its flagship product, the iPhone, fell, with little else to take its place” (Goel, 2016). The article reports that Apple sold 16% less iPhones than the same quarter last year. The higher revenues a year ago can be easily explained if you consider the iPhone upgrade cycles. Every two years a new iPhone is launched, and the years between Apple releases small upgraded features to the same model. In September of 2014 they released the iPhone 6, their first device with a larger screen. “The company has just announced that it set a ""new record"" after selling 10 million units of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 units combined during their three-day launch weekend beginning Sept. 19” (Arce, 2016). It would make sense why iPhone 6 sales are spilling over into 2015 Q2 numbers. The 2016 Q2 period is coming off of the iPhone 6S upgrade cycle, where less customers are upgrading their phones compared to 2015 Q2. In September of 2016 Apple will release their newest iPhone, the iPhone 7. 

The article also uses another negative opinion from an outside analyst, “There’s no question that Apple’s best days are behind it,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at the Bernstein brokerage firm. “The company grew at astronomical rates, and it’s now so big that its ability to grow at those rates doesn’t exist anymore.” (Goel, 2016). The analyst holds a popular industry-wide opinion: Apple cannot maintain its current growth. Despite the fact that Apple is being beaten down by Wall Street and suffering from global economic concerns, I will clearly explain why Apple is a clear and strong buy. 

**Interpreting the Financials**

The second quarter results were not in line with analyst expectations. “The Company posted quarterly revenue of $50.6 billion and quarterly net income of $10.5 billion, or $1.90 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $58 billion and net income of $13.6 billion, or $2.33 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 39.4 percent compared to 40.8 percent in the year-ago quarter” (Hoover, 2016). That’s a Q2 drop 12.79% from the same quarter one year ago. But a 10.96% increase from the same quarter two years ago. Their EPS is down 
18.45% from a year ago, but up 14.45% from the same quarter two years ago. Despite this Q2 miss, Apple’s gross profit margin decreased by 3.43%, but over the past year they have increased their NPM by 5.73%. During the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook announced more money being brought back to the shareholders. They announced an additional $50 billion to their program to return capital back to shareholders; they authorized $40 billion towards share buy backs, and a 10% increase in their quarterly dividend. Apple likes returning money to its shareholders, which can be seen with their high ROE ratio. ROE is up 49.76 from 2013, and 26.31% from 2014. 

During the conference all Apple’s CEO said, “Our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds” (Hoover, 2016). It was reported that international sales accounted for 67% of the quarter’s revenue, which could explain the missed revenue growth for the past few quarters. If more than half the revenues are hurt by the strong dollar, Apple looks rather strong considering they still pulled in $50 in revenue. 

Their $230 billion in cash is located overseas and would have to pay the full 35% corporate tax to bring it back to the US. This cash isn’t just sitting there; it’s placed into long-term marketable securities earning interest. To avoid paying all the taxes to bring the money back to the US, Apple announced in February of 2016 that they would issue $10-12 billion of bonds to finance share buybacks and dividends. “Apple said that the proceeds from the deal would be used for “general corporate purposes” including “repurchases of our common stock and payment of dividends under our program to return capital to shareholders” (Jackson, 2016). It’s cheaper for them to issue debt than to use their own cash, plus they get a tax write off for the interest expense. 
To show how strong Apple’s financials are, I will be comparing them with two of their largest competitors: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MFST). Although Apple has many competitors, I believe these two companies are the only ones that have a real shot at taking market share from them. Microsoft has been very successful with software and licensing, and has recently released their new Surface device. The Surface has been very popular and has given Microsoft some hope in competing with Apple’s iMacs. Their Windows phones however don’t pose any serious threat to the iPhone, and will most likely never catch on. I believe Alphabet is Apple’s #1 competitor. They’re both valued at around $500 billion and focus heavily on research and developing grandiose innovations. “Even though they compete across a huge range of subindustries, such as computing software, hardware, operating systems, mobile devices, advertising, applications and Web browsing, each firm takes a different approach from an organizational and philosophical perspective” (Ross, 2015). You can see that all three companies have high gross profit margins, but Apple achieves a slightly high net profit margin. 
Apple has always had incredibly high gross profit margins and maintained high net profit margins throughout the years. Their 2016 Q2 reported NPM of 22.87%.  What’s more impressive, is their ability to maintain high net profit margins year after year. In the past 12 quarters Apple has seen steady improvements in their NPM. These steady margins are attributed to their excellent management. You can see how well Apple has been managing their assets and improving their net profit margins. Compared to their competitors, their ratios are significantly better. These ratios show how effective Apple’s management is with supply chain management and asset turnover. These high gross profits and stand-out ratios are reasons why Apple has looked so attractive to investors. Their ROA increased from 17.04% in 2014 to 18.38% in 2015, an increase of 7.86%. They charge higher prices compared to their competition, and they maintain high gross margins, year after year. 

As mentioned before, investors hold Apple to a much higher standard than other companies. Apple has to not only beat earnings expectations, but they have to beat them by a 
significant margin or else the market will punish the stock price.  Benjamin Graham said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” This is a 
company that isn’t meant to be traded; it should be a long term investment. The peaks and troughs should be ignored and in the long run, Apple’s true valuation will be priced in. Their second quarter numbers weren’t in line with expectations, but I strongly believe their stock has seen an irrational and unjustified sell off in the past year. On February 23, 2015 Apple shares hit its all-time high of $133/share, which gave them a market cap of $736 billion. They were expected to be the first trillion dollar company. Quarter after quarter they met all expectations, yet the stock continued to fall to where it is today. As of April 28, 2016, Apple is trading at $94.83/share, roughly down 28% February 2015.  The price to earnings ratio is a way of valuing a company based off its share price divided by its earnings per share. If a company has very little earnings compared to its share price, the ratio can be extremely high. Netflix and Amazon for example have both high P/E ratios because they have very little earnings. Investors who buy these high P/E stocks are paying very high multiples. They’re valuing the companies as if they actually made money. Apple on the other hand, is trading at very low multiple and the market has already priced them in for lower future sales. Their current P/E ratio is 10.88, meaning you’re only paying 10 times earnings. You can see from the attached chart that it’s quite cheap compared to its competitors. Alphabet is trading 30.39 times earnings, and Microsoft is trading for 38.82 times earnings. You can say that you’re paying 179% more for Alphabet, and 256% more for Microsoft.

**Revenue Streams**

The main article discussed in this paper suggests that Apple’s innovation and high growth has peaked. Like tech companies of the past have proved, a company can’t stay hot forever. Investors believe that when iPhone sales start slowing, Apple’s valuation will collapse. I will breakdown Apple’s revenue streams and explain why they are more than just a smartphone company. In their second quarter earnings report they showed high revenue growth in their services sector accompanied by their highly valuable ecosystem.

While Apple is known as a hardware company, they are making huge revenues through their services and expanding ecosystem. “Investors may have been focused on the decline in iPhone shipments when Apple reported its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but there was one bright spot which could be a key driver of growth for the U.S. technology giant: Services” (Kharpal, 2016). Their services include products like iTunes, their App Store, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. On the Q2 earnings call, Tim Cook said, “We are very happy with the continued strong growth in revenue from Services, thanks to the incredible strength of the Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over one billion active devices” (Hoover, 2016). Apple’s ecosystem makes all these services much more accessible, which leads to much higher revenues. “Revenue from services came in at $5.99 billion in the fiscal second quarter - a 20 percent rise from the same period last year, highlighting the focus Apple has been putting on the segment” (Kharpal, 2016). While Apple sees higher revenues during iPhone upgrade cycles, their Services give them recurring and growing revenues. There’s a lot of room to grow in some of their newer services, “The current 13 million subscriber number for Apple Music, which chief executive Tim Cook announced yesterday, was small in comparison to the over 1 billion install base of Apple devices” (Kharpal, 2016). 

Apple’s ecosystem is an integral part of the whole user experience when using Apple products.  It’s also a big reason why Apple users would never considering switching to Google’s Android devices. “As the years have rolled on however, it’s clear that Apple’s competitive advantage isn’t built on its hardware or its software. Apple’s greatest competitive advantage is its ecosystem” (Jackson, 2016). Apples ecosystem includes the following: iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, iCloud, Apple TV, App Store, Apple Watch, Apple Pay, Car Play, and the Health Kit. All of these devices are continuously synced together. As an example, you can start an email on your iPad, and finish it on your iPhone. You can download music through iTunes and it will simultaneously be available to listen to across all your devices, including your CarPlay located in your automobile. When someone buys an iPhone, they will most likely purchase more Apple devices inside the ecosystem instead of buying an nonintegrated PC from Microsoft or device from Google. “Apple today trumpeted that gross revenue from its iOS App Store -- which now also includes software for the Apple Watch and Apple TV -- exceeded $20 billion for 2015, implying that sales were up between 40% and 47% year-over-year” (Keizer, 2016). It’s easy to see how valuable Apple’s ecosystem is for both the consumers and their total revenues. 

**Apple’s Next Big Move**

Apple is often criticized for having so much cash, but never making any big acquisitions. I’m bullish on Apple because I like cash rich companies that are patient and extremely careful with their capital budgeting and acquisitions. They have some of the smartest minds in the industry and I suspect they are working on several large projects.  Reports show that Apple has been hiring experts from the automotive industry to begin developing a car. “Apple has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. They said the project, code-named “Titan,” has an initial design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of these people said” (Ramsey, 2015). Why should they make their own car when they could just buy Tesla? Apple might be able to do it cheaper, have full autonomy, and build something that blows Tesla away. Just to put things into perspective, Apple has so much cash they could buy Tesla, Netflix, and Starbucks, all at a 20% premium. Yet, Apple hasn’t been making any big acquisitions. They have made one small acquisition in the past year: a virtual reality startup. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” an Apple spokesperson wrote in an email to VentureBeat” (Novet, 2016). Facebook on the other hand, has been snatching up numerous companies. In 2014 alone, they acquired 56 companies, one of which cost them $19 billion. Apple on the other hand has not announced any big plans, besides the car, and we must assume they are planning something big. It’s possible that Apple knows they don’t need to acquire anything; they have the most valuable company in the world and boast a 40% profit margin. 

I think within the next five years Apple’s market share will dominate all world economies at a far greater scale. I believe they will consume the entire smartphone market share, and their ecosystem will aid in higher revenues and increased customer retention. I think their valuation will shoot well past one trillion dollars after they make one of the largest acquisitions in world history. I can speculate, and see Apple buying a company like Visa, one of the world’s largest multination financial services company. 

Apple has grown from a hardware and software company into a luxury brand with the highest of customer loyalty. They are cash rich, well disciplined, provide a high ROE, and are currently trading 28% below its 52 week highs. As Benjamin Graham said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” Apple has been beaten up in the past year due to macroeconomic factors, but has proven they can still churn out 200B in annual revenue in a bad year. Apple is only trading at 10x earnings, they are months away from the iPhone 7 upgrade cycle, and I rate Apple (AAPL) as a strong buy.

29,2016-07-11,SmoresPies,3,"As a speculative investor, how far off the worn road am I?","With the recent news of Nintendo's success with Pokemon GO, I can't help but revisit the ideas I see for the near future(within 5-10 years). And in trying to list them, I was curious as to what you guys believe the future holds, if you agree and possibly if you could shed some light on the areas I haven't considered.

I see a massive push towards renewable energy. People are calling Tesla's move on SolarCity a wash because it has no benefit. I disagree as I saw a similar argument being presented when Netflix said they were splitting their company and look how well that turned out for them.

Another area I see potential growth in is these AR/VR market segments. If GO is any indication what lies beyond the frontier of the mobile platforms true potential, the next couple years are going to send your head spinning. With this speculation in mind, I have considered 4k resolution cameras for future generation mobile devices, along with semiconductor manufactures, is there another area I should be looking into to capitalize on this upward trend?

With that in mind, I've started to look into optical transistors. From my understanding, this is the technology that will and quite possibly already has started to supersede fiber optics. Some are speculating this discovery will pave the way for quantum computing, as well as fast-as-light communication(no downloads, instantaneous streaming, no buffers, etc) However, most companies I've considered in this field, are either still in the R&amp;D phase or are in the process of buying smaller manufactures to make the transition when the time presents itself. I could be wrong, but this is one of the reasons why I believe it's taking Google as long as it has to roll out their fiber network but who knows, maybe there's more red-tape than I can comprehend. So given this area of technology will upend our current computing standards, am I better off looking at the big dogs like Sony, Samsung, Google, and other titans-- or, in the off chance, they aren't ready for this developed tech, should I follow these R&amp;D firms hoping to sign off on some larger than life partnership?

Lastly, I believe there is something interesting going on in the vein of pharmaceuticals, however, the industry is already well established. Although, with the legalization of marijuana and the pursued research in alternative medicines(ie LSD), I can't help but wonder what type of cures will come from such interests. I've also found a hard time locating the companies along the frontier of this directive, mainly because a lot of their press releases are medical mumbo-jumbo that sails over my head.

Anyway, to wrap this up, what do you guys think? Have I lost my mind? Am I onto something? What do you all believe?"
