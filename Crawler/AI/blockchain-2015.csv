0,2015-02-22,Reggie-Middleton,0,"Looking for Beta Users for Groundbreaking P2P Swap Trading System, Maximum Leverage, Minimum Risk, All Markets","I'm looking for traders to take positions (either in agreement with, or contrary to) my research/opinion or using your own trade setups and fundamental/macro outlook - via our P2P swap platform. You can use actual capital or I can give you test capital, basically, play money, to trade with me and my team and all I ask for is feedback on the system and the ability to quote you (which is not mandatory, but it would be nice). You can trade stocks, bonds, commodities, forex and forex pairs long or short, or swap the exposures directly for another asset, ex. S&amp;P 500 for the LSE 100, Apple for Google, etc. Fees start at 5 bp, the best available from anywhere. Digital leverage is available, up to 10,000x worth (double digit profits/losses can be had from 11 basis points in movement, or less - so be careful), with no possibility of a Margin Call since the trades are pre-funded.
If you think the opportunity is worthwhile, feel free to [contact us](http://ultra-coin.com/index.php/contacts/featured-contacts) or see info sheet below for more...

Macro Trading Has a New Power Tool: Peer to Peer, Counterparty Risk-Free Swaps for Value Transfer &amp; Trading

Trade the value of over 45,000 tickers of instruments in every asset class from every major geography and exchange with up to 10,000x pricing leverage without concerns of counterparty/credit/default risk or margin calls. Very big claims… substantiated by a very big discovery in value transfer and security.

Veritaseum is the worldwide leader in the financial implementation of “smart contracts” – unbreakable, self-executing bilateral agreements between two or more parties. We use these smart contracts to create peer to peer swaps for the transfer of value through the “blockchain,” a worldwide, open ledger of pseudonymous transactions that can be seen and audited by anyone, any time in the cloud. The blockchain is considered unhackable and one of the most secure implementations of cryptography to date.

With the use of financial “wallets”, client side applications that use a simple interface to guide users in the quick (as in minutes – enter ticker(s), amount to risk, collateral, expiry and leverage required) creation of a smart contract (in this case a P2P swap), users trade OTC directly with other parties – totally bypassing and intermediating exchanges, with even less risk. Monetary value is committed up front, a leverage factor is digitally dialed in (anywhere from 2x to 10,000x) and the smart contract is created and sent to the blockchain to await a match. Once matched, the funds are locked into the transaction until expiry, at which point profits and losses are distributed along with principal and unused collateral (the capital chosen to be put at risk). A novel, risk averse, extremely powerful, and quite frankly - ingenious way to trade macro strategies.

Not only can one go long or short any ticker in any asset class from any region for any currency, one can go long one ticker relative to another. For instance, those with a bearish outlook on the S&amp;P 500 normally short it for USD. You can now short (pay) the S&amp;P 500 index directly while going long (receiving) Eurozone equities (or 10 year treasury yields, or Swiss francs or the CNYJPY pair or bitocin), in a single transaction – with or out without leverage.

Since the exchange is peer to peer, we never hold or control any of your assets, hence you are not exposed to our balance sheet, credit, default or counterparty risks (the blockchain is your effective counterparty). Veritaseum is a software concern, not a financial concern or intermediary! You can always track your assets and trade through the blockchain at any time. The capital is loaded in the wallet in the form of bitcoin, and for those who choose to minimize exposure to bitcoin market price volatility, leverage can be used to nearly eliminate the noise. You can also conduct trades using a demo mode and test coins, so as to use the system without risking actual capital.

# Smart Contracts as Transaction Vehicles: The Safest Possible Way To Exchange Value #

Veritaseum's UltraCoin smart contracts are:
1. highly flexible - you design your own derivatives yourself using your own parameters via our simple graphical user interface
2. self-executing
3. autonomous
4. unbreachable: we call them, the unbreakable promise! They are backed, fortified and stored by/on the blockchain itself
5. uber-transparent: simple click the ""trace transaction"" button to find the location and historical travel path of your assets anytime, from anywhere you have an internet connection

# Trading Through a Balance Sheet-Based Financial Institution vs. Distributed, Decentralized, P2P Software Concern #

What I do want to accomplish is the education through the fact that the Bitcoin protocol has given rise to the genesis of a new type of company, with a new business model that can offer a totally new type of product. As you were able to see from above, Veritaseum's UltraCoin offers a very uniquer product with many if not all of the attributes that potential competitors offer, with a slew of attributes that others can't touch. This is done at 1/5th of the price and at much less risk!
When dealing with Veritaseum's UltraCoin, you can never get Gox'd because we never have (nor do we want) possession of your coins or fiat - every, at any time. Because we don't user our balance sheet (we are a software company, not a centralized exchange or broker/dealer) you:
 
- are never exposed to us as a counterparty, we make the blockchain your counterparty

- never have to worry about our capital reserves or the capitalization/credit of your initial counterparty (all trades are fully funded at the outset, even a heavily levered trade at 10,000x), 

- You never have to worry about negative drawdowns, negative equity or margin calls
- If a catastrophic event were to occur, say bi-coastal earthquake takes out our datacenters on the east and west coasts simultaneously while a meteor hits the backup center in the midwest, you will still be able to recover you funds - on your own. Since we do not have possession of your funds you don't have to worry about us absconding with them nor getting blown up with them. Each trade has a catastrophic rollback feature which will put you back into your original funding position n-time units after expiry. Unfortunately, you will not be able to complete your trade, but if two bi-coastal trades hit at the same time as meteor to the mid-west, you may not be studying that EUR short anyway :-)

------  
  
By MICHAEL J. CASEY April 29, 2015 11:04 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd.  
  
Goldman adds its name to a growing list of Wall Street institutions exploring digital-currency technology’s potential to provide faster and cheaper financial transactions and payments.  
  
Circle, based in Boston, uses bitcoin-based systems to allow customers to digitally store money and transfer it to and from other people and merchants.  
  
The new $50 million injection comes on top of $26 million in prior financing founds for Circle and, according to people familiar with the deal, values the startup at around $200 million.  
  
Goldman declined to comment about its investment beyond a brief statement in the news release from Tom Jessop, managing director of the investment bank’s Principal Strategic Investments Group. He said the investment bank sees “significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.”  
    
Circle said in a statement that the investment bank’s co-lead investor was China-based IDG Capital Partners, an early investor in Chinese Internet giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. The firm’s involvement reflects a new push from Circle to break into the Chinese market.  
  
The funding news coincides with Circle’s move to allow consumers to hold traditional currencies in their accounts in addition to bitcoin. Chief Executive Jeremy Allaire said Circle will start with dollar offerings but then provide Chinese yuan accounts and other currencies once it can do so practically and compliantly.  
  
Also joining the investment round were Circle’s existing investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners and Digital Currency Group. The firms’ individual contributions weren’t disclosed.  
  
Goldman’s commitment to Circle follows investments by the New York Stock Exchange, Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and USAA Bank in San Francisco startup Coinbase, which runs a bitcoin exchange and competes with Circle in the market for bitcoin wallets, with which users store and send digital currency.  
  
Also, UBS AG this month said it would establish a special research lab to explore financial uses for the core technology underlying bitcoin—its so-called “blockchain” digital ledger.  
  
The strategy to offer dollar-based services marks an important shift for Circle, which began as a purely bitcoin wallet service. Mr. Allaire says the inclusion of fiat currencies is consistent with the firm’s founding philosophy.  
  
“We’ve always preached this idea of the hybrid digital economy where fiat currencies can move frictionlessly around the world using bitcoin as the free Internet payment network,” Mr. Allaire said in an interview.  
  
Dollar account holders’ funds will reside with Circle’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured banking partner, Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, Calif. It is expected that similar setups will be established with regulated banking entities as Circle establishes access to yuan, euros, yen or other currencies.  
  
Unlike other fast, low-cost, dollar-based digital money-transfer platforms such as PayPal or the digital money-sharing app Venmo, which operate exclusively inside their own “closed-loop” networks, Circle’s inclusion of a bitcoin connection allows users to send money outside the firm’s network. It achieves what Mr. Allaire describes as the goal of interoperability.  
  
Circle is trying a similar strategy in the Chinese market, where hundreds of millions of mobile-phone-toting consumers frequently use closed-loop services such as Alibaba’s Alipay service and the payment app attached to Tencent’s messaging service WeChat. Mr. Allaire called China “an extremely attractive market in terms of consumer behavior and in terms of scale,” highlighting the Chinese government’s desire to develop an economy that is led by consumers that spend their money globally.  
  
It is a similar bet to one being played by Beijing-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin, which is launching a “Superwallet” for storing yuan and other currencies, giving users the capacity to use those funds to purchase goods offered for sale in other countries in bitcoins.  
  
“The opportunities for cross-border payment activity and for digital money are exploding as we speak,” says Jim Breyer, a partner at Breyer Capital and Accel Partners—both early investors in Circle, who in the past has collaborated in Chinese investments with IDG.

So what else do you need to see?  Blythe Masters is working in bitcoin space, the first bitcoin exchange fund will begin trading soon, and now Goldman Sachs can't even afford to ignore bitcoin any longer.  
  
Berkshire Hathaway, 2.92% owner of Goldman Sachs, just caused Mr. Buffet to make his first investment in the emerging tech universe of cryptocurrency.  Why?  *Because it's a smart move!*  
  
It might hurt to admit that I'm right on this one, but I am.  2016 is going to see bitcoin prices way, **way** higher than piddly $220 each.  
  
The financial universe can only send you so many wakeup calls.  It would be foolish not to have at least 1% of your portfolio in bitcoin or bitcoin-related tech at this point.

**Nasdaq Signals Confidence in Bitcoin, Not Just the Blockchain - American Banker**

&gt;Critics often pay Bitcoin a backhanded compliment by calling it the Napster of finance. The underlying technology may change how business is done, they say, but the system itself isn't long for this world.

&gt;Now the Nasdaq stock exchange is challenging that conventional wisdom by not only testing Bitcoin's much-vaunted blockchain technology, but doing so on the Bitcoin network.

&gt;Last week Nasdaq announced plans to use Bitcoin's blockchain – a real-time public ledger of transactions – with the exchange's private markets platform, designated for firms preparing for initial public offerings. **Users will be able to issue and transfer securities on the blockchain via the Open Assets protocol, which uses specific units of bitcoin as tokens to represent ownership of equity shares or other assets.** These tokens are referred to as ""colored coins."" If all goes well, Nasdaq may expand its use of blockchain technology to other businesses, including its central counterparty clearinghouses and central security depositories, according to a person familiar with the company's thinking.

Cont here - http://www.americanbanker.com/news/bank-technology/nasdaq-signals-confidence-in-bitcoin-not-just-the-blockchain-1074405-1.html

Having gone over some recent discussion related to Bitcoin recently in /r/investing I'm continually surprised to see people solely focusing on the currency aspect of Bitcoin when it is the least interesting part. Forget the unit of account, the implications of that are largely irrelevant until one understands the other aspects; namely the payment network yet more importantly that a Blockchain is an immutable ledger and hence settlement system. 

The unit of account on it's own is worthless. It is the use of the network for a variety of reasons which gives the underlying worth. Use cases are developing rapidly as is evident in NASDAQ building systems using Bitcoin's blockchain.

I found this to be a fairly high level analysis that only really looks at Bitcoin from the perspective of a payment network. When I value the network, I try to take into account all of the possible uses, some of which I outlined in my post, ""[The Multifaceted Nature of Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@lopp/the-multifaceted-nature-of-bitcoin-94d79c95b9ef).""

On the other hand, if you do want to perform a simple valuation of the infrastructure underpinning the network as opposed to the value of the utility it provides, I've also [looked at it from that perspective](https://medium.com/@lopp/the-value-of-bitcoins-infrastructure-4eff264ee2be).

In short, Bitcoin is incredibly difficult to value in comparison to traditional commodities, currencies, and equities because it is viewed as different things by different people. However, as an industry insider, it is clear to me that [more entities are becoming interested in the Bitcoin network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgjrS-BPWDQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3h31m13s) and [are exploring ways](http://www.businessinsider.com/barclays-derek-white-on-bitcoin-and-blockchain-2015-9?r=UK&amp;IR=T) that they can make use of it."

8,2015-12-08,americanpegasus,0,Everyone here needs to get familiar with something called Monero and Cryptonote. Even as cryptocurrency moves out of the nerd's basement - the greatest crypto-asset has yet to begin its ascent.,"If you know me, you will know that I have spent years studying and reading about money.  In my stock trading days, I made some good picks and enjoyed the support and arrogance of many members of this community.  But honestly?  I've made the most progress while learning about the *nature* of money itself.  
  
I've spent the last 2+ years reading about cryptocurrencies non-stop.  I also have been pretty dead-on as far as bitcoin adoption in the past few years.  
  
So let me take a moment and tell you that the next 'big' thing may not be bitcoin at all, but it's overlooked (and secretly more attractive sister).  
  
This is a subject that could fill a book but I'll outline several key points to pique your interest in hopes you'll do your own DD.  It's not too hard to actually own Monero, but I'm not here to pump up something I already own - I hope that you will do the research and come to the same conclusion that I have: the ascent of crypto is inevitable, as is the ascent of Monero.  
  
**Critical Point #1:**  The financial sector is rife with talks of the 'blockchain'.  But you simply cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin, as much as Goldman Sachs and Blythe Masters would like to.  This is the foolish equivalent of Russia claiming they don't like the internet so they are committing themselves to building their *own* internet.  
  
Bitcoin is an open-source network, and with any open-source and decentralized financial network things are proceeding as they should - often chaotic with many surges and crashes on the way to ultimate stability (which occur at a much higher price point than now).  
  
**Critical Point #2**: Bitcoin is remarkable in that it advanced money in a very real way beyond what was currently possible but it is *not* the holy grail of digital money that many computer scientists and economists had dreamed of.  
  
Consider the following chart:  http://postimg.org/image/aqjmkgusp/  
  
- We had decentralized and private money for thousands of years with gold.  
- The 'digital dollar' gave us digital and private money (to some degree - banks and processing institutions still had to track you to process your money).  
- Bitcoin came along gave us digital money that no entity owned for the first time but at a cost: everyone can browse every bitcoin transaction back to the beginning of time.  This is obviously unsuitable as a default behavior of a currency - privacy must be built-in, it cannot be some optional add on feature.  Imagine having to obscure every sensitive credit card transaction you make so that it wouldn't be totally public knowledge.  
- Monero (as the largest and most successful implementation of the Cryptonote protocol) emerged from anonymous sources in 2014.  It is not some stock, or some silly nerd toy.  It is no less than the *holy grail of digital money itself* combining for the first time in human history the elements of digital, decentralized, and private.  
  
How does it do this?  By way of something called ""cryptographic ring signatures"".  You can either trust the egg heads who designed it that it works like magic, or develop the ph.D level mathematical knowledge to verify it yourself.  Either way, know this is likely one of the most sophisticated computational objects our species has ever created.  
  
Not only that but it also improves many fundamental aspects of Bitcoin:  
  
- Not happy that Bitcoin is deflationary?  Monero has a small perpetual tail emission that means that miners will always have more Monero to mine.  (after the initial 18.4 million, approximately 400k per year will be minable in perpetuity)  
- Not happy with the blocksize debates raging across the Bitcoin landscape?  Monero uses a variable size blocksize and a per-kb fee so that those debates will never happen on this blockchain.  
- Worried about total privacy being banned by the law (and more likely the IRS)?  Well Monero has **two** keys.  One is a private key that lets you spend your money, and the other is a view key that lets you (or another trusted party) view your balance without actually giving them access to spend it.  
  
This is not a stock, or a commodity.  This is not some get rich scheme (although many will get rich in the coming years on it).  This is nothing less than the new dominant form of money for our entire global civilization.  
  
And you are one of the very lucky few who just learned about it first.  
  
The future will be filled with anonymous money transactions whizzing through the internet at the speed of light, instantly and with no one's permission.  The fees will be a micro-fraction of what are being paid today, and it will be just like the birth of the internet all over again.  
  
This is the 2020's staring you in the face, folks.  
  
Don't be left behind: Educate yourself.  
  
Yes, Monero are only 30 to 60 cents each at the moment, and yes if they succeed in becoming the dominant private financial network on Earth then that per-unit price will likely go to some absurd number that you wouldn't believe if I told you.  You probably wouldn't have believed that 50 cent bitcoins in 2011 would be worth over $1000 by 2014, but it still happened.  
  
That's not the point though - to create a brand new, decentralized financial network from nothing you have to make a few people rich.  There is no other way to do it.  The point is that the future of finance is in cryptography and blockchains and you need to either understand it or retain the talent that does if you hope to continue to be a relevant player over the next 20 years.  
  
If you have any serious inquiries about Monero or blockchains, I will be happy to answer them here and you are always welcome to join us over on /r/monero for more talk about Cryptonote or our project.  If you were one of the one's who scoffed at Bitcoin (like I did) in 2009 - 2012 even as it began it's meteoric ascent, this is your moment of redemption.  
  
Let's not make the same mistakes.  
  
Thanks for your time.
