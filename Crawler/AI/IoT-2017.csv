# Description

Skyworks Solutions Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and markets semiconductor products, including intellectual property. The Company's analog semiconductors are used in the automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets. Its product portfolio consists of various solutions, including amplifiers, attenuators, detectors, diodes, filters, front-end modules, hybrid, mixers, switches, and modulators. Gawd, that sounds nerdy, doesn't it?

Perhaps, but the client list doesn't :) Arris, Bose, Cisco, Dell, Foxconn, Fujitsu, General Electric, Google, Honeywell, HTC, Huawei, Landis &amp; Gyr, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Nest, Netgear, Northrop Grumman, OPPO, Rockwell Collins, Samsung, Sonos, VIVO, and ZTE. 

Though, it's the theme of ubiquitous wireless &amp; IoT that's probably the most exciting part of this story:

* huge growth is wireless connectivity
* lots of different frequencies and technologies
* a need for seamless handoffs, signal transmission, etc
* more efficient power management
* design challenges with a need for light, small, slimline offerings
* a move from discrete components to customized integrated circuits
* and finally huge demand unfulfilled in emerging markets for smart phone

With that backdrop SWKS highlights

&gt; We are at the forefront of advanced multi-chip module integration and offer unmatched technology breadth, providing deep expertise in CMOS, SOI, GaAs and filters and maintaining strategic partnerships with outside foundries.

Forgive me Nvidia shareholders, but is SWKS the ugly sister / cousin?

## Recent financials 

aside: it's a Sept year end.

Looking at the figures, there's nothing exciting about the top line. Though the change in product mix from regular phones to smart phones is helping to drive higher margins and better earnings. 

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $3.3bn | $3.3bn | $2.3bn | $1.8bn | $1.6bn|
|EPS | $5.18 | $4.10 | $2.38 | $1.45 | $1.05|

Plus they arn't shy about acquiring competitors.

## Competition

They don't paint a rosy picture about the overall market &amp; the competition, but hey, this is the chip industry, so what's new!

&gt; The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, QUALCOMM, and Qorvo. We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. 

Now let's put the narrative to one side and look at margins and returns. Wow... best in class. Even QCOM would be jealous. ;)

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Skyworks Solutions Inc | $3,289M | 42% | 30%
Analog Devices, Inc. | $3,421M | 37% | 17%
Broadcom Ltd | $13,240M | 28% | -14%
Maxim Integrated Products Inc. | $2,194M | 33% | 21%
Microsemi Corporation | $1,655M | 21% | -2%
NXP Semiconductors NV | $8,664M | 20% | 11%
QUALCOMM, Inc. | $23,554M | 35% | 18%
Qorvo Inc | $2,792M | 27% | -1%

## Cash / Debt?

Skyworks Solutions Inc has $1,084M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 7% of the market value of Skyworks Solutions Inc. So management's keeping some powder dry in case a nice little competitor can be snapped up.

In fact they tried to buy PMC Sierra in 2015, only to lose to Microsemi. Though good to see they gave up instead of destroying shareholder value and overpaying.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $86.30 for Skyworks Solutions Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

When it comes to valuation it's on 13x and that's at the bottom on the sector. Seems a bit weird, given the high margins and good returns. Though the dividend yield is a little disappointing.

SWKS.O | $14,555M | 13x | 15% | 1% | 10%
ADI.O | $22,395M | 21x | 7% | 2% | 7%
AVGO.O | $71,698M | 13x | n/a | 2% | 3%
MXIM.O | $11,748M | 21x | 10% | 3% | 8%
MSCC.O | $6,498M | 15x | 17% | 0% | n/a
NXPI.O | $34,040M | 17x | 27% | 0% | 4%
QCOM.O | $98,774M | 14x | 11% | 3% | 10%
QRVO.O | $7,481M | 13x | 15% | 0% | 8%

# Dividends

Skyworks Solutions Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.13 per share, compared with a forecast EPS of $6.13.

And they've bought back circa $1bn of stock over the last 3 years.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 11%. Though frankly, that EPS upgrade is really just the rolling forward to the new fiscal year, with an expectation of sales up to $3.5bn in the coming year, and a tiny bit of margin improvement.

Supposedly the detractors worry they are too exposed to Apple and the iPhone. An Interesting aside is the stock's up 900% in the last 10 years versus Apple up 800% and the darling Nvidia up 400%. Though... the fears are justified. 40% of last years sales were to Foxconn (who work for Apple) and 10% were to Samsung! Ouch. 

So, do I want to invest in a 50% smartphone play 50% other (IoT etc)? At 13x it's bang in line with Apple or Intel. And it's cheaper than a lot of the banks stocks. 

Maybe this is one of those delightful ""boring stock"", that will perform a dream over the long-term... though in terms of an economic moat, I fail to see a particularly strong one. 

Any long-term owners here on reddit?

1,2017-01-11,cantbelieveitsbacon,8,CES 2017: Datacenter REITs the winners?,"From what I've seen, everything showcased at CES that made the headlines relies on transferring gobloads of data to and from remote servers. 

Smart driving cars rely on constant communication with datacenters.

Smart gadgets are only smart if they can info back and forth from remote servers in datacenters.

5G wireless bandwidth increase is for ioT and gadgets talking to the cloud... well the cloud is in fact datacenters.

It seems the corner stone of all the tech displayed at CES is datacenters with seemingly infinite bandwidth and processing power.

Yet I've seen very little mention in the press about data centers. After all the ""C"" in CES stands for ""Consumer"". Consumers don't see data centers.

But I'm trying to take a step back and look at the big picture. if anyone is going to profit from these new techs, it's Data Center REITs, right?

Any thoughts?"
4,2017-03-13,TheBinaryAdvisor,0,"Please, name a few stocks that you think should split in 2017","Being able to predict and interpret properly impending stock splits is a very important part of a traderâ€™s strategy.

Theoretically, there are two different variations of split stocks. In the classic case, as the asset works by the principle x:y where x is greater than y, the price is reduced. In this case we can say that the stock was overpriced. As for 2017, stocks that I have heard are rumoured to split the way outlined previously are the oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX), 3M (NYSE:MMM), the travel giant Priceline Group (NASDAQ:PCLN) and others.

A phenomenal split is predicted in the case of Airports of Thailand Public Co (NASDAQ: AIPUY). The reported ratio is 10:1, which is quite uncommon and, strategically, a great source of profit.

The other variation is the reverse split, which is a sign that the stock was underpriced. Most of the IoT companies are probably prone to reverse split because of their sudden breakthrough. 
However, the risk of going in the red is just as high. According to NASDAQ an instance of an unusual reverse split ratio that is up to happen is Rennova Health (RNVA), the fraction being 1:30.

Nevertheless, are there any signs that prove an impending split? What stocks are likely to split in 2017?

5,2017-05-10,Ur2ndFavCivilNgineer,12,How are you preparing for increased Data Consumption?,"I have 3 main points to discuss in regards to an increase in mobile data/internet consumption

1) Self Driving Car revolution--&gt; cars need mobile data, passengers need mobile data

2) IoT--&gt; increased in home internet

***3) I don't know much about VR but I assume it will require more bandwith. **This could totally be wrong

I'd like to invest in the data/internet infrastructure.

ATT looks like a good bet with mobile data &amp; fiber connections laid down for home internet

In terms of a longterm play is ATT my best option?

Does ATT actually own the cell towers or do they lease from Cell Tower REITs?

7,2017-08-15,InterestingNews1,1,Earnings jump for Oclaro in what looks like early stages of supercycle. Trailing PE of 16 looks cheap.,"Optical network firm Oclaro (OCLR) is benefiting from increasing demand from streaming, IoT and the cloud in what could be a super cyclical upswing.  Results announced last week saw revenues jump 47% and earnings 364%.  With 80% of revenues coming from fast growing 100G, growth is expected to continue - not as fast but at a healthy rate.  Trailing PE of 16 looks cheap.

This is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are not suitable for all investors. Please do your own research."

9,2017-10-24,ohrlee,82,How to invest in 5G?,"A few years ago, I posted about what companies will be growth investments and 10x in size in the future.  My pick at the time was Universal Display ($OLED) which is still on its run up with thesis playing true.  Great and all...

However, it's about time to identify the next greatest stock investment and I'd like your help.  One of the themes I've identified is 5G mobile networks, an anticipated 2020+ technology that solves existing constrained data rates, latency, and will enable next generation technologies including autonomous driving, IOT, and many others that are data intensive and require the throughputs and latency.  It's still in its infancy today and bringing 5G to reality does not come without its challenges (e.g. such as standards), but that presents opportunity and is an inevitability for me.

What is the best positioned companies that manufacture antenna, small cell, radio frequency chips, cell tower, fiber, radio spectrum, patent holders in 5G?  Who are the enablers of all this?

Again, margin of safety is key so a history of top line growth and profitability are ideal, with strong balance including little to no debt.  I'm trying to identify the no-brainer investment here that is on the cusp (could be few years) of a J-curve.

Some companies I've come across include: $SWKS, $COMM, $CCI,  $AMT, $IDCC, $QCOM, $NXPI, $AVGO, $ZAYO, $NOK, $ERIC.  Then there's the traditional carriers like $VZ, $T but those are less interesting.  $STRP is a prime example of a quality tech candidate that went up 5x with $VZ's offer to acquire.

Cheers and let's make money together."
