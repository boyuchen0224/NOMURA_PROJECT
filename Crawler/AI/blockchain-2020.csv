2,2020-01-02,Sportsman18,1,My Stock pickings for 2020 (Degiro),"Hi guys, I'll share with you my chooses for my wallet to hold for more than 20years. I'll start buy from this month ahead.

European:

* EDPR (PSI-20)
* Ibersol (PSI-20)
* GAMESA (IBEX 35)
* ACCIONA (IBEX 35)
* CAF (IBEX 35)

International:

* KO (NYSE)
* SBUX (NYSE)
* MSFT (NYSE)
* ACB (TSE)
* VZ (NYSE)

ETF's:

* VUSA (EAM)
* NHI (NSY)

 Each company was analyzed in the 'Financial report' (Revenue, Net Income, EBIT, EBITDA, P/E, Cash Flow, Debt and EPS), latest news and market performance over the past 5 years. 

 Without going into too much detail:  

***Energy Sector (EDPR, GAMESA):*** It is a sector where companies are gradually starting to focus on renewable energy and something that I believe in the long run will be very positive.  

***Telecommunication Sector (NOS, VZ):*** The main reason that led me to choose these was the upcoming 5G technology that will drive revenue.  

***Beverage &amp; Entertainment Sector (KO, SBUX, IBS):*** KO is a very solid company and recently acquired Costa Coffee (I think it will increase its revenues in the long run), SBUX is a strong company that has been showing good results.  

***Construction Sector (ACCIONA, CAF):*** Both companies have good results and good prospects in the future. They are present in various forms (trains, meters, highways, energy etc ..) in various countries around the world.  

***Technology Sector (MSFT)***: For now I chose Microsoft because besides being a solid company, has been showing good results and recently joined the blockchain (in Azure). Keeping an eye on AMD.  

***Pharmaceuticals Sector (ACB):*** This is an area that I believe will bring value to the care of certain diseases. 

In ETFs, I chose NHI because it is a well composed and with good volume (24H) and VUSA because it comes with the S &amp; P500  

\--***Possible crisis 2020?*** \--

Maybe, maybe not, who knows? What is known is that in the long run (+20 years) it will not make much difference.

***WARNING:***

This is NOT a advice on what to buy, I just did my research and according to my profile. 

I'm a first-trip guy I'm willing to risk beyond comfort. ***Open to suggestions and opinions.***   
 

Good year and good investments to all!!"
3,2020-01-02,financeoptimum,1,Venture Capital and Accredited Investors,"We can look at many companies that went public and made VCs A LOT.

A VC firm raises 'funds' from investors (called LPs).

Obviously, the return on some of these IPOs not only 'makes the fund' but can 'make the firm'.

Not only does the VC firm make a 20% performance fee on the upside, but they also collect **management fees** every year.

The reputation that this one deal can give them makes it far easier to raise more capital for future funds, therefore resulting in **more management fees**.

For a $1BN fund, that is $20MM every year, which is split between the General Partners (GPs) of the VC fund.

Of course, if one of the portfolio companies is a Unicorn, then they get some (20%) of the upside as well.

The tech boom in Silicon Valley has of course created a lot of value in society, with products being used by hundreds of millions if not billions of people. The entrepreneurs who take this risk and retain equity become, in many cases, billionaires and this is only fair - as they are providing value at scale (and have to take some form of risk to achieve it). This also creates huge amounts of wealth for these investors, **WHO ARE ALL ACCREDITED INVESTORS**.

To me, that is not meritocratic.

Anyone over the age of 18 surely should have the ability to invest their capital into startups.

After all, people are able to put themselves into $10Ks of college debt at that age and, in many areas of the world, are able to gamble without restriction.

Yet they are not able to participate in the early rounds of companies such as Facebook, Uber, etc.

Now any wave of technological innovation often leads to wealth inequality.

These waves of innovation create vast amounts of wealth, and this is not unique to Silicon Valley.

It has happened throughout modern history.

The first great wave was steam power, which eventually led to the creation of the locomotive. Steam power fed the Industrial Revolution, which created fabulous wealth.

In the early 1800s, much of this excess wealth generated by steam power and the Industrial Revolution went into locomotive stocks on the London Stock Exchange, forming a bubble - which popped in 1850. The heyday of the railroad would be the 1880s and 1890s; so the Crash of 1850 was due to speculation and the wealth created by science, but the real job of railing the world would take many more decades. So despite the bubble bursting, America was left with an infrastructure of railroads that made intercontinental travel and shipping dramatically easier and cheaper.

The second great wave was led by the electric and automotive revolutions of Edison and Ford. The electrification of the factory and household, as well as the proliferation of the Model T again created fabulous wealth. But this excess wealth had to go somewhere. In this case, it went into the U.S. Stock Exchange, in the form of a bubble in utility and automotive stocks.

People ignored the lesson of the Crash of 1850, as that was a full eighty years in the past.

From 1900 to 1925, the number of automobile start-up companies hit 3000, which the market simply could not support.

This bubble was unsustainable and for this, and other reasons, the bubble popped in 1929 creating the Great Depression.

The main paving and electrification of the United States and Europe would not fully take place until after the crash, during the 1950s and 1960s.

The third great wave was the coming of high tech - in the form of computers, lasers, space satellites, the Internet and electronics. Again, the fabulous wealth had to go somewhere. In this case, it mostly went to real estate - creating a huge bubble.

People of all incomes were over-leveraged...

Greedy bankers fuelled this bubble by giving away mortgages like water, and the Fed also played a role.

Once again, people forgot history and the lessons of the crashes of 1850 and 1929, and we had the 2008 Great Recession.

This leads us to the following question: what is the fourth wave?

Of course, no one knows for sure what is going to happen in the future (if they did they would just be betting on sports 24/7 without restriction, as long as they're over 18...)

But it seems reasonable to assume that fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, nanotechnology, telecommunications, and biotechnology will play a significant role.

Again, fabulous wealth will be created but hopefully in 2090 people will not ignore the lessons of the past and hopefully a **greater proportion of the population have the ability to invest and benefit from this wealth creation**.

4,2020-02-21,NinjaCarcajou,1,What are the possible scenarios for the next 3-5 years,"I have seen a lot of talks in this sub about an upcoming recession and the burst of the everything bubble, but I'd like to try and list some of the possible scenarios for the coming years, along with the corresponding strategy. These are just my thoughts so feel free to correct me if you think I'm wrong somewhere and to add any other outcome you think is possible (not necessarily likely). Here are a few examples of what I have in mind:

1) Status quo: The current deflationary pressures continue, allowing central banks to keep on issuing more debt. Fundamental indicators remain strong and valuations keep on rising. Negative interest rates become more and more widespread. Strategy: Invest in the general market (indicial ETFs, growth strategies).

2) Plateau: Valuations hit a plateau and the markets start exhibiting punctual moderate drawdowns, followed by long periods of moderate growth.  Strategy: Value investment and flight to quality, carry more cash to take advantage of the punctual drawdowns.

3) Inflation: Inflation finally catches up, forcing central banks to stop quantitative easing and increase interest rates. The market drops over the course of several months. Strategy: Carry cash (unless you think inflation is going to hit really hard), gold, bitcoins

4) Reset: Global debt is reset as is has almost become purely theoretical (more than 300% of global GDP). Strategy: Own hard assets (gold and other commodities, real estate).

5) Monetary decentralization: The monetary system becomes decentralized thanks to blockchain. Definitely a stretch on a 3-5 horizon, but a possibility on the longer term. Strategy: Similar to 4) I guess as 5 could be a consequence of 4.

6,2020-02-15,victoroshi99,1,Elrond weekly Tech update is here,"The purpose of the ElrondNetwork blockchain is to improve the experience of every internet user. But sometimes we are developers building for developers. Our new royalties system and tools should excite our fellow programmers. Here’s our week

1/ The final economics model implementation is underway, with the notable addition of Smart Contract royalties: 30% of all the fees from the processing of one smart contract will go to its author.

2/ Our Python CLI &amp; SDK “erdpy” was enriched with features such as new, build, deploy, call and test. The Elrond IDE now uses erdpy as backend, to keep it lean and focused on its intended purpose.

3/ Our system Smart Contracts for staking and auction have gained a set of new functionalities: jail, unjail, changing rewards address, changing BLS public key, all of which take effect at the end of an epoch. Changing or disabling these features will be controlled via governance

4/ Other notable achievements: - validator rating broadcast from metachain to shards for consensus group selection computation  
\- go routines used for all database writes which reduces the commit time  
\- started work on a framework for fuzzy tests

5/ - leaders now broadcast a block before committing it to local storage, reducing consensus time  
\- overall security increased by removing the node start dependency on redundant private keys  
\- unfinished metablocks and cross-shard miniblocks are included in the hardfork snapshot

6/ - created auction smart contract unit tests for different scenarios  
\- leaders and validators now execute miniblocks in the same order to avoid receipt mismatch errors  
\- created additional tests for our Arwen VM and Smart Contract API

7/ - the validator statistics processor has been improved to process missed rounds in batches  
\- special syntax added to the Rust API for asynchronous SC-to-SC calls  
\- migrating away from kyber to the go builtin crypto library for the accounts signature scheme

8/ - improvement in consensus group selection algorithm to ensure fair validator selection based on their rating  
\- new field for peers allows their distribution to different lists (waiting, eligible) and easy trie recreation - additional tests for the hardfork mechanism process

9/ - fixed an edge case where a node could participate in the consensus even if it was still syncing  
\- fixed a block tracker issue that would remove some headers too early -  
audit findings implementation  
\- several hard-to-catch bugs have been resolved  
\- bugfixes &amp; stabilization

8,2020-02-07,kodjima33,1,Why I switched to crypto after I traded 10 years with forex,"I recently noticed that the Forex trading market is insanely regulated which means that the middlemen are present everywhere in this world, therefore, I decided to make my analysis about the so-called wonderful world of Forex trading.

Starting with unresponsive brokers and ending with smartly hidden fees and costs, the Forex trading process can become very expensive very fast and this can happen even before a trader can turn a dollar into profit.

This means that traders need to have a considerable amount of capital before they can begin trade. I also believe that institutional involvement is another significant aspect of Forex trading, unlike crypto, Forex traders are competing with established banks, high-frequency traders, and other specialized companies.

In a nutshell, I have found that this institutional involvement makes it very challenging to compete.

Here are some very interesting and productive facts as to why cryptocurrency trading is better than forex trading:

**1) Your safety, your money**

Unlike the Forex market where there are many suffocating regulations, as well as many cases of identity theft, crypto traders that use digital currency are in direct control of their transactions which makes everything much safer. Another important thing here that I’ve noticed here is that the transactions are made free from the identities of the parties involved. This grants a considerable amount of help in protecting users from all forms of identity theft.

**2) There is no inflation**

Every traditional currency experiences different inflation fluctuations because of the ongoing movement of global economies which shifts prices continuously. In response to this, countries print more money, therefore, increasing capital inflation. Cryptocurrency does not experience this issue. That’s why it is more predictable.

**3) Cryptocurrency trading is a clear process**

Unlike forex trading crypto trading uses a recorder which is called a blockchain, it is here where all transactions are recorded and monitored. In other words, when a transaction is completed it is automatically transcribed on the ledger. These transactions can be verified by anyone anytime. No person or organization can modify this ledger this is why this is considered to be the biggest security feature.

**4) Fast and solid transactions.**

Probably the best advantage, when compared to the forex market, is that the crypto market is free from any type of central banking regulations and control as well as other third-party vendors, that’s why transaction fees are extremely low.

**5) Availability**

The crypto investment funds bring many opportunities between parties anywhere in the world. These enable individuals to use and trade cryptocurrency even if they are from harsh countries without solid banking institutions.

**What are crypto funds and why they are beating forex?**

In the complex world of cryptocurrency trading, a user is required to have plenty of crypto assets.

Those who are new to this practice are already mining an abundant quantity of cryptocurrency, without the help of an investment fund this can be rather difficult due to the growing complexities of the prospecting process.

So I ask myself how can novices build up their assets?

This is when a crypto fund comes into the picture!

I’ve discussed with [trading specialists](https://fundplatform.io/?utm_source=reddit) who specialize in creating crypto funds to give you all the characteristics of what the crypto funds are as well as the new outcomes in this field.

A crypto fund is the regulated asset of a digital currency that is accessible to the investors for replication, it also works as a connection between a trader, who is producing the crypto fund, and the one who would gladly invest in that supply.

The concluding goal of engaging in a crypto fund is to augment crypto assets for both the winning participants.

In the year 2020, the crypto funds have evolved as the digital translation of fiat currency. Because this is an independent form of currency, it enables anyone to inaugurate a fund solely by adding a new cryptocurrency.

As a consequence, several types of crypto funds have developed aiming to gratify the desire of investors and traders so that they can ultimately increase their digital assets.

Many currencies are regulated by their governments making them sensitive to financial and pecuniary procedures as well as other geopolitical developments. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are managed instantly by clever algorithms and are only influenced by the actions of those using them. This makes the crypto market more engaging for investors who do not want vulnerability to inflation or state administration policy arrangements.

**Why did I invest in crypto funds instead of trading or mining**

Here are the major advantages that you may experience after you invest in a crypto fund:

* The leading advantage of financing in a crypto fund is that the cryptocurrency is going to be the money of the tomorrow. Therefore, financing in such crypto funds will aid you to earn a solid future.
* Most of crypto funds are open, sharing their asset structure with weekly reports
* People can invest in crypto funds from anywhere in the world
* Cryptocurrency mining has now grown more complex than it was in the past. Because of this, the rate of crypto mining is reduced due to the notable turnover of people towards cryptocurrency and the developments introduced in the mining algorithms. It became harder to track new movements in the market
* Investing in crypto funds fits a reliable method to develop your assets.
* Crypto funds offer greater profit margins.
* The volatility of assets is limited.
* As a crypto fund manager You can fundraise investments directly to your wallet without any type of fees
* Absolutely anyone can invest in your trading strategies even if they are a million miles away.
* You are not required to be legally registered (but if you want people to trust you - you have to be legally registered)

Ending Ideas

In conclusion I feel confident that Forex is now becoming a trading process of the past and it will continue to remain affixed in the 2000’s but now in the year 2020 the future resides in the crypto investment fund because it is a highly suitable method to earn money without getting stuck in any difficult mining algorithms.

The order is for 5,000 full size electric buses, for use in various locations. The vehicles have an average cost of 800,000 Renminbi (approx. $115,000 USD) per unit, with the order totaling 4Billion Renminbi, or approximately $575 Million USD.

The vehicles will be procured from a number of manufacturers within MEG's partner alliance and will be subject to a rolling delivery schedule throughout 2020 until 2022. MEG has identified commercial EV buses as a strategic segment of its business, and one in which it feels it can derive significant revenues in the next few years as EV buses deliver significant ROI for tour bus and city bus fleet operators in terms of fuel savings.

""This order is a pivotal moment for our organization, as we move to EV for our bus operations"" said Xu Yingcai, Chairman of Beijing Silk Road Rainbow. ""Our transition to clean energy is important to our organization, but also for our customers who depend on our transportation services and rely on us to make the best decisions for the environment. We are delighted to work with Mobile Energy Global and their Qingdao sales hub to fulfill this order and bring our autobus fleet to a cleaner and more energy efficient future"".

15,2020-03-17,DismalDebt,1,"The economic crisis is coming, maybe is the best time for us?","We're in a tough economic climate and the dream job you want might not be available for the next few years. I am currently developing an alternative economic system and would love to know how you think about it.

The idea was to provide an ecosystem where economic activity can happen in it, without being interfered with /regulated by the current capitalism+nation setting. A system that part of it will rely on peer-to-peer technology for censorship-resistance other crucial deliverables needed for the project, such as programmable contract and inherent currency. I am also thinking about an ID system supporting a higher level of cooperation and weighted democracy, and other performance enhancement, such as privacy protection using zero-knowledge proofs.

In short, its current form is an online software (it's in beta). The infrastructure of the transaction and most of the scripting was provided by a blockchain-based platform called Ethereum. Now it can: create financial services such as banks, investment services and set the rules by themselves. I have designed a visual programming language to make it easy for people that don't code. The system can also generate a mechanism on demand that might provide job opportunities. Currently, I only have enough time to develop an agent-based sales system. There is also a mechanism that allows people to make derivatives and other financial instruments, but it's not completely done yet.

I am looking forward to discussing the idea with people that would be interested in what this system stands for, and coming up with more idea and feature to put in there.

Just like how Wei Dai put it in his famous b-money essay: ""A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts.""

16,2020-03-15,Opportunist2020,1,"ASPU: The Next APT, RIOT","In recent history there have been stocks that have been perfectly aligned with the marcoeconomic environment that have enjoyed massive run ups. Some names that come to mind are RIOT in 2015 which went from $3 to $45 during the blockchain craze and more recently APT, a manufacturer of hazard masks, which saw its stock price run from $3-$41 during the outbreak of COVID-19.

From shorting airline/cruise companies to buying remote communication companies (ZM), investors are looking for ways to capitalize on the global pandemic.  I believe Aspen Group Inc. (NASDAQ: ASPU) is the next company perfectly situated to make a massive run.  

Aspen Group is a well capitalized (recently completed a large secondary offering at $7.15) online education tech company specializing in nursing degrees.  What separates ASPU from other online schools like STRA, LOPE, ATGE, ZVO etc. is that it has its own proprietary in house marketing technology whereas the competition relies on third party marketing companies to acquire students.  This has been critical to its success as student acquisition remains the highest operating cost industry wide and while competing firms are paying $5000+ for each new student, Aspen is paying around $1000.  Because of this competitive advantage Aspen is able to enroll students at almost HALF the cost of its competition while still maintaining superior gross margins. The results have been 50%+ revenue growth over the last few years (significantly leading the industry).  As recent as a few weeks ago, it hit an all time high of $10.27 and last week reported all time high earnings beating revenue forecast consensus ($12.5M vs $12.1M) yet has fallen below $6 as of the close Friday 3/13 indubitably due to the general implosion of the stock market. 

The demand for nursing degrees has never been higher than it is right now, and all of the learning can be done remotely in the safety of the student's home.  Aspen has also never been better capitalized or had stronger fundamentals then it does right now, and given the health crisis and student debt crisis crippling America's youth,  I believe Aspen is not only significantly undervalued from a fundamental perspective, but also has as good a chance as any stock to be the next APT or RIOT.   

Attached is another article written about Aspen (which I didn't write).

**Ideanomics Provides Updates on Subsidiary Treeletrik, plans IPO**

&amp;#x200B;

*- Ideanomics eyes Treeletrik IPO in 2020*

*- Treeletrik receives land title in port area for development into assembly facility*

*- China-based manufacturing partners to be part of land development, to include belt-and-road investment*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

NEW YORK, March 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Ideanomics, (NASDAQ: **IDEX**) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced an update on its Malaysia-based Treeletrik subsidiary.

Ideanomics acquired 51% ownership in the holding companies of Treeletrik in 2019 and the company has since begun organizing itself for growth in the ASEAN region. As part of its expansion plans, the leasehold of land graded for development has been upgraded to title holder to offer Treeletrik flexibility with the development of the 250-acre site at Gebeng Industrial Estate in Kuantan, Pahang Darul Makmur. The assessed value of the land is approximately 100 Million ringgit or $25 Million.

As part of the land development strategy, Treeletrik is planning to bring in a number of China-based manufacturing partners to help round out the EV offerings under the Treeletrik brand. Those discussions are taking place directly with Treeletrik management and augmented with discussions facilitated by Ideanomics' MEG subsidiary. MEG has been able to attract interest from China's belt-and-road development agencies for the South Asia and ASEAN regions, and anticipates that interest to develop into investment both directly and through China-based commercial EV and battery manufacturers.

Already under way with its expansion, Treeletrik has secured sizeable electric motorbike and moped orders through distributors in Indonesia, and talks are ongoing with other countries expressing an interest across their vehicle range. Indonesia's population, like many other countries in the ASEAN region, relies heavily on motorbikes for transportation based on two important factors of cost and traffic congestion. To compliment the bike sales opportunities, Ideanomics is assisting Treeletrik with developing a focus on commercial EV activities.

Additionally, as the land development, manufacturing partnerships, belt-and-road investment, and large-scale orders will all result in significant expansion in both Malaysia and International operations of Treeletrik, the company will look to go public in either Singapore or Hong Kong, with the possibility to do so later in 2020. The IPO will provide Treeletrik will additional capital to fuel its growth plans, and in turn unlock value for the broader investor market.

NEW YORK, March 10, 2020 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- [Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2745651-1&amp;h=202550487&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics), (NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced a detailed update to its Mobile Energy Global (""MEG"") activities, including the impact of the Coronavirus on its Q1 activities.

In general, Chinese companies returned to work at the start of March with most major commercial activities slowly getting back to normal. MEG's partners have been impacted to varying degrees and recent conversations have shown there is a resolute effort being made to recover quickly from the effects of the outbreak. Currently, there are no details available for any government stimulus programs to help the Chinese economy recover from the shutdown, so we are unable to determine what participation opportunities, if any, may be available to Ideanomics and MEG.

**A: Financing / Funding for Fleet Purchasing**

In September 2018, Ideanomics announced its agreement with First Auto Loan, regarding lease financing and ABS products with a target of raising $6 Billion to fund the lease financing of ride-share vehicles and other types of app-requested taxis. This agreement is currently in progress and will benefit from the capital sourcing referenced below.

In November and December of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced the creation of multiple funds in association with Dasheng Licheng Lease Financing, with Ideanomics bringing in several high-profile insurance companies to provide large-scale funds to support EV lease financing programs. The final province-level registrations were underway when the outbreak occurred and are now back underway. The impact on bringing these funds to market will now extend into Q2 but should otherwise remain unaffected.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an agreement with China's Yunnan province which included lease financing for the heavy truck segment, with backing by AAA-rated province-specific entities in conjunction with MEG's lease financing programs. The deal also provided for investment into charging station infrastructure, as well as investment into Treeletrik via Yunnan's role as the ASEAN region's belt and road sponsor. The shutdown impacted the timing on this, particularly as it pertained to final registration and approvals at local government, but is expected to be reinstated in the near term.

**B: EV and EV Battery Manufacturing Alliance**

Over the course of the past 18 months or so, Ideanomics, and subsequently MEG, has partnered with leading EV and EV Battery manufacturers, including JAC, Geely, Beijing Foton, CATL, and Yinlong, among others. These partnerships are an important part of the overall offering and assist MEG in offering competitive procurement and order fulfillment. Having best-in-class partners ensures we can meet the needs of fleet operators in terms of vehicle specifications, quality, reliability, and cost and continue to attract large-scale order interest.

As part of the commencement of activities in Qingdao, we will be showcasing many of these partners at our EV sales hub and anticipate additional manufacturing partners participating based on their value to the overall offering.

We had begun to implement a joint marketing strategy with select partners, including our participation with CATL in the now postponed EV Mining event in Stockholm, Sweden on March 18-20. It has been tentatively rescheduled until November of this year, due to Coronavirus concerns.

**C. Joint Ventures and Other Strategic and Umbrella Agreements**

Ideanomics and MEG has announced several agreements as either joint ventures, strategic partnerships, or umbrella agreements, which form part of MEG's business development and revenue pipeline development activities. These include deals with the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Yunnan for MEG involvement in supporting the transition to EV mining, which we anticipate will be a significant revenue division for our organization; Zhitong 3000, where we intend to offer their fleet customers' MEG services; activities securing relationships with tourism associations to develop EV tour bus revenues; and more. Each of these is progressing in the normal course of business in the context of earlier sections of this update and, in particular, section A as it pertains to lease financing services.

**D: Sales Agreements for Execution**

In August of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with iUnicorn, to procure and finance 90,000 taxis for the city of Chengdu, in addition to other cities. In September of 2019, MEG announced the delivery of an additional 4,127 taxis, with confirmation of a further 11,000 to be delivered by the end of 2019. These are subject to the return of local government, to process the final rebate and registration approvals. We anticipate this occurring when the spring temperatures reduce the impact of the outbreak and cities return to normal levels of commerce and the resulting demand for public transportation is restored to pre-outbreak levels.

In November of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced an order from Yunnan province for 35,000 taxis, and an additional order for 2,300 taxis from the city of Guillin, in Guanxi province. Both of these orders are delayed due to the closure of non-essential local government services, which we anticipate returning to normal in a similar manner to the iUnicorn JV.

In addition to the sales agreements mentioned above, the MEG team has developed a diverse pipeline of sales orders, with interest and activities in all four of its EV revenue divisions of Heavy Trucks, Buses and Coaches, Logistical Vehicles, and Taxis. In lieu of the lease financing funds availability, MEG has been pursuing bespoke financing for each order, respectively. Furthermore, the recently announced Qingdao sales center activities will help further augment sales going forward.

**E. Global EV Sales Expansion**

In March of 2019, Ideanomics announced the acquisition of 51% of Malaysia-based EV manufacturer and distributor, Treeletrik. Since the acquisition, Treeletrik has hired an experienced CEO from the automotive industry, increased its sales and after sales operations, upgraded the land secured under the acquisition from leasehold to title holder, secured orders elsewhere in the ASEAN region, and is in negotiations to bring in a number of Chinese EV manufacturing and EV battery partners to help round out its KD and assembly activities such that it can scale its supply operations to ensure order fulfilment.

Outside of Asia, MEG has received some preliminary order inquiries in the Middle East and plans to broadly expand its global footprint once all of its China-based activities are under way.

**F: Energy Sales**

MEG's core strategy is to acquire fleet customers, through offering innovative and cost-efficient transition to EV, such that we transition the consumption of energy from Gasoline and Diesel onto cleaner Electricity. MEG has signed numerous joint venture and strategic partnership agreements to help develop its relationships in this regard and plans to sell both pre-paid electricity at a discount to fleet operators, as well as participate in the lucrative EV charging market. Each of these is valid and in process for normal course of business, with the major highlights detailed below.

In July of 2019, Ideanomics announced agreements with Three Gorges, to include Tianda Energy and Ding Fang, and Palcan Energy to finance and develop EV fast charging networks. MEG has continued to explore these and other EV fast charging technologies, including those from our EV battery partners, as detailed in the PetroChina update below.

In September 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with PetroChina, to begin a project to repurpose gas stations to EV fast charging stations, starting with the city of Nanjing. To date, as there is rapidly-evolving technology development in the areas of EV charging and energy management and storage solutions, we are dependent on the certification of new technologies and apparatus for commercial use such that we ensure the most up to date technologies and charging experience are deployed.

**G: Other Financial Services / ABS**

In August of 2018, Ideanomics announced an agreement with NTC to provide ABS refinancing for buses in several China cities, including Tianjin. Subsequently, Ideanomics announced agreements in January of 2019 with financial institutions to provide financing and other services to support the ABS under the NTC agreement.

The debt rating of Tianjin at municipal level, along with delayed deliveries from manufacturers, has proved challenging for underwriting and issuance of ABS. In June of 2019, Ideanomics signed an agreement with EV bus and battery manufacturer Yinlong covering both China and Ex-China activities. As Yinlong had already delivered 5.1Billion RMB of manufacturer financed EV buses in Tianjin, outside of the Ideanomics agreement, we began discussions in late Q3 / early Q4 with Yinlong to reorganize the registration and recording of those delivered assets such that they can be compliant with ABS requirements. That activity is underway, albeit it was disrupted and delayed by the Coronavirus activities in the region. Additionally, MEG plans to work closely with Yinlong in 2020 to help support the delivery of additional city bus orders in order to facilitate the ABS refinancing accordingly.

In June of 2019, Ideanomics and MEG announced a joint venture with GCL, to include GCL contributing guaranteed sales orders of 500,000 logistical vehicle orders over the next three years. These orders will require financing under the lease financing activities covered in section A, as the original barter-plus-subsidy deal put in place is not being accepted by manufacturers. Several of the small to mid-size orders from the GCL order flow are currently in the pipeline to help develop and streamline the deal expediting process of our lease financing activities.

NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- [Ideanomics](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2680758-1&amp;h=3321306575&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D2605015-1%26h%3D3496217845%26u%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.ideanomics.com%252F%26a%3DIdeanomics&amp;a=Ideanomics), (NASDAQ: IDEX) (""Ideanomics"" or the ""Company""), has today announced that its MEG Group, in partnership with GCL as part of MEG's logistical vehicles segment, represents the first of a pipeline of logistical vehicle sales and financing for 2020. The order is for a total of 1,200 logistical vehicles and fulfilled by China-based EV manufacturer [Jiangsu AOXIN New Energy Automobile](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=2680758-1&amp;h=12719485&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aoxinauto.com%2Feng%2Fabout1.asp%3Fid%3D1&amp;a=Jiangsu+AOXIN%C2%A0New+Energy+Automobile) Co., Ltd. through their X30L model, with the first 500 ordered in Q4, and the remaining 700 being ordered for Q1, 2020, for a total possible order value of 167 Million RMB, or approximately $24 Million.

The initial order signed during Q4 is for 500 vehicles, with the remaining order for 700 vehicles in Q1 2020. The vehicles are city/urban delivery cargo vans intended to facilitate last-mile deliveries. MEG will derive fees from this transaction through arranging the procurement and financing, although the company has not yet completed the accounting analysis to determine whether this revenue should be recorded on a Gross or Net basis under US GAAP – meaning the revenues may reflect net fees earned and not the $24MM order value.

""We are thrilled to get our first EV logistical vehicle orders underway, as this represents our largest potential segment of MEG in terms of vehicle order numbers and is the second of our four operating segments to successfully source large-scale EV vehicle orders,"" said Alf Poor, CEO of Ideanomics. ""This helps us confidently plan for 2020, knowing that each of our four segments is going to be active and, along with our bus and heavy truck segments, are already sourcing deal flow. With our taxi activities in Chengdu and Guilin held over until Q1, due to municipal subsidies and new taxi license policies being put in place for 2020, we were able to bring this deal together quickly and efficiently, prior to our lease financing funding channels coming online. This, together with our Taxi activities in Chengdu, Guilin, and Yunnan province in Q1, will provide us with a platform that will ramp up in Q2 and beyond as our business begins to hit its stride.""

The logistical vehicle market in China is estimated at 14 million vehicles, making it a considerable growth market for the EV industry.

21,2020-03-05,heinekens,1,My theory of what is happening and might happen soon. (DISCUSSION),"Hi there,

I have been thinking about what is happening recently with the economy and came up with this theory, what do you guys seriously think about this? Sorry if the grammar isn't perfect, I'm not a native speaker.

Interest rates are getting lower so money has basically become a cheap product, companies can lend cheap and money is being printed every day. So if there is so much money being injected into circulation, why is there still low inflation? I think there is a lot of inflation but just not on consumer products, the inflation is actually on the stock market. Think about where all the cheap and newly created money has been flowing: in the hands of banks, companies and governments. Companies use it to invest and buy back stocks resulting in growth based on money that still has to be earned. Banks use it to cheaply offer derivatives so that a small investor can pump a lot of money into the stock market with a click of a button. In addition, individuals cannot earn anything on a savings account so there is an unseen amount of investments in the stock market. Also, governments are having so much debt, I'm not even sure what they do with it anymore.

The problem is, once people start to sell stocks, this money is flowing back into the hands of the consumer and consumer products might start to inflate as the money supply hasn't shrunk. We have seen now that when people panic-sell, they sell every kind of investment: Commodities, crypto, stocks etc. So it would seem that investors that have sold are just converting all investments into cash and nothing else. I have this feeling like people just prefer to wait until the market bottoms out and then go back in.

The problem with the above is that if the majority of the printed debt money that was previously 'hyperinflating' the stock prices, will be on individuals bank accounts ready to spend. Will this then cause hyperinflation on the real estate market and consumer good market? I think it is very likely that when so much money is just going to peoples bank accounts, the money will devaluate fast.

If this theory is correct, then people that have been raising their net worth with the stock market and sell before or at the start of a recession, they might be set back close to the same buying power they had when they started investing. And people that did not invest at all would lose a lot of their buying power. The only winner I could think of then would be the ones earning money in this bull run and shorting a recession.

So what could be happening after this event according to my ideas? People lose trust in currencies that are easily printed through debt and this currency crisis might turn people and governments into using blockchain technologies to control the supply and demand of a currency.

I am looking forward to your comments"
22,2020-03-05,drunk_on_koolaid,1,CMV: Trump's negative interest rates,"This 🌈🐻 (hi!) thinks that Trump will get his way with negative interest rates. While I do not agree, I'm going to debate on Trump's side here b.c, well, yolo.

CMV, negative interest will make America great again

--

Negative rates are great even for the average American.  You get paid to pay off a loan, and your new*, upgraded bank account will invest your money into an ETF or bond portfolio of your choosing.

There's a catch, but we can all live with it since it's coming anyway. Your banking institution will need to restructure. With positive interest rates we have a rigid structure that doesn't allow looming changes.

Increases in automation, blockchain development, and low bond yields globally are forcing restructure plans for government and banks. The future Trump is pushing for will include all of these. Mobile banking already removes barriers to accessing your money. (No more telller.) Blockchain will secure transactions. (Global outreach via mobile banking; greater security.) Free access to investing platforms will keep bond issuances low. (Mobile investment platforms allow everyone to invest in AI that manages your money, including bonds; AI systems will appropriately price markets, reducing volatility.)

Negative rates are inevitable, especially if Trump wins. The banks will have to adapt, fast, as the fed is already playing ball in Mar-a-Lago.


TL;DR
-Recieve to pay-off a loan
-Pay to hold money in banks
-Lending will increase
-Volatility will increase, only until people are mostly removed from the asset management equation"

First of all, recession/crisis prediction or timing prediction is a very wide and difficult topic. **There are also many different indicators, aspects, scenarios to look at**. So, I am sorry that I am not going to go into details (only main points) and many do not need it as well. I will keep it as short as possible.

And I hope there are not too many mistakes cause off-putting when you read as English is not my first language. Any recommendations, discussions, new ideas would be greatly appreciated.

**Overview**

At the beginning of March, dow jones, S&amp;P 500, cryptocurrency marketcap dramatically fell down due to the virus. That makes sense. About 3 weeks later, there were good news: these indices has been increasing, some countries has controlled the pandemic, not completely, but it is much better. Assuming we are at the beginning stage of the recession. The question is what happens next. I consider there are two scenarios:

**Scenario 1**: We control the pandemic well and governments’ actions can save the economy.

In this case, we will wait for covid-19 treatment vaccine and live together with the virus (coexist) just like we did before with other viruses such as H5N1, Ebola or SARS. In fact, as far as we know, mortality rate of this virus is not high . Also, it depends on underlying illnessesn. Serious and critical cases tend to be slower.

Moreover, probability of US recession in the next 12 months has decreased to 18.5% (compared to more than 20% that I saw at the last months of 2019).

*Everytime this number is larger than 20%, there is going to be a recession or crisis in from 12 months to 24 months ahead. Normally, a recession only last for 6 months. You can also have a look at constant maturity rate.*

So, in other words, businesses (education included) could reopen, factories bring workers back, we will almost back on normal life (perhaps at the end of 2020 or at the beginning of 2021). This might be a good news.

**Scenario 2:** We cannot deal with the novel virus, people’s efforts cannot save the economy.

There has not been a country test all people. Only in developed countries, there are statisticians and epidemiologists good enough to use statistical models to estimate the reliable number or they have enough resources to implement broad testing. It means there are some active cases somewhere that have not been detected. Another point I suppose we shoud notice is that Chinese reported numbers is untrustworthy. There are also many non-symptoms cases.

Admittedly, these above indices (dow jones, S&amp;P 500) has been going up during the lockdown, I believe that this is governments’ efforts (the most obvious action is printing money), not from purchasing power from consumers or producing products of companies.

Additionally, civilian unemployment rate is not likely to go down again.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)

In this case, we face a depression.

Finally, there is a conflict in my head. But I personally think the probability of the first scenaro is higher and I have a bias towards it. Other than that, there must be “something new” after each recession (I mean changes). I expect this new change will come from blockchain, digital currency, bitcoin, ethereum.

# After all, for any predictions, the important thing is that we should make appropriate decisions, informed choices to your types of assets.

What is your opinion?

29,2020-04-20,Dagoru95,1,Am I the only one who thinks MasterCard/Visa business model is at risk?,"You have Chinese society paying homeless people with Wechat/Alipay using their phones. Some saying they haven't used cash credit cards, or even a wallet, for the last two years!

Now add fear of cash created by Coronavirus, Chinese and other governments considering blockchain to replace fiat, Facebook proposing Libra, or even cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (still too little transactions per second though).

By the way, Alipay fee for merchants is 0'55%, Wechat 0'6%, while Visa and Mastercard is around 2% of each purchase. And this is only in China, you have similar companies in Brazil, India, South East Asia countries, etc.

I only see to two possible scenarios:

1) they lower their fees to compete in this new environment.
2) they heavily invest in updating their business model.

Both ways they loose money.

Don't get me wrong, I love this companies and have been an investor for more than 12 years in both of them. I'm just a little worried about the world changing so quickly and they don't being able to keep performing as well in the future."
30,2020-04-18,Morgan442,1,CRYPTOCURRENCY recommendations,"What cryptocurrency do you think’s going to take off next just like bitcoin??



A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets.[1][2][3] Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized digital currency and central banking systems.[4]

The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.[5]

Bitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009, is generally considered the first decentralized cryptocurrency.[6] Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created."

Would love to hear them!,"I want to invest 20k in XRP, according to [AustralianfinTech](https://australianfintech.com.au/westpac-says-rba-issued-digital-currency-would-boost-blockchain/);

“Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank, Macquarie Group and nine other international members of the R3 consortium have completed a trial of blockchain technology which saw funds transferred between banks across borders using Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP....”

“Westpac says RBA-issued digital currency would boost blockchain”

This is for Australia at the moment, personally I’ve taken a break from altcoins and just hodling; so would love some ideas for an Aussie crypto investor in terms of alt coins and/or bitcoin investment with the sum being up to 20k AUD.

Open to hear your thoughts about this and perhaps maybe alternatives if XRP isn’t the best way to go? My thinking around this is if the big banks of Australia are getting in on it, and actual use case for the blockchain; it seemingly sounds viable. Please do feel free to correct me! 


I’m also open to other avenues besides blockchain altcoins; such as anything bringing 8-12% returns p.a. 


Thanks all, looking forward to your thoughts and suggestions.

EDIT: I am, financially speaking - very well off. This 20k is merely just me looking for other avenues for passive income. My properties are doing well, but now that use cases are internationally becoming accepted due to their former xRapid facade, liquidity and what not. Just struck me as an opportunity. Thanks so much for
The replies guys!"
32,2020-04-08,FinancialMovers,1,Bitcoin halving will drive the price over $60k in 2021,"## Bitcoin halving: most anticipated event in bitcoin's history

There's a finite number of 21 million bitcoins, but there's only 18 million in circulation. The remaining 3 million bitcoin will be added into circulation as they're mined.

Bitcoin is mined and added into circulation every ten minutes through the process of mining. Miners earn bitcoin by verifying bitcoin transactions and movements on the blockchain using specialized [ASIC ](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/)computers equipment. Essentially miners are accepting bitcoins as payment for their transaction services.

When miners verify transactions they are mining what is called blocks (hence blockchain). Right now the reward for mining one block is 12.5 bitcoins, which occurs every ten minutes. After the halving in May the reward will be 6.25 bitcoins per block mined. 

When bitcoin was created in 2009 the reward for mining one block was 50 bitcoins. Every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years) the reward for bitcoin is halved. May's halving will be the coin's third halving in almost twelve years since its conception.

* 2009- 50 BTC per block
* 2012- 25 BTC per block
* 2016- 12.5 BTC per block
* 2020- 6.25 BTC per block

Bitcoin was programmed to halve every 210,000 blocks to control inflation. It also gives an incentive for miners to constantly be working the blockchain and verifying transactions.

## So what's the hype? 

Money. Wealth. Riches. 

Anyone who's heard of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies knows there's a lot of volatility and price swings. In the past three weeks bitcoin's price increased [75%](https://www.financialmovers.com/post/where-is-bitcoin-going) giving financial movers an opportunity to increase their portfolio. 

Because of the upcoming halving event, less bitcoin will instantly stop entering the market, which in theory, will drive demand and price.

“The theory is that there will be less bitcoin available to buy if miners have less to sell,” said Michael Dubrovsky, co-founder of mining R&amp;D nonprofit [*PoWx*](https://www.coindesk.com/powx-the-new-effort-to-change-bitcoin-and-whos-backing-it) in an interview with [*Coindesk*](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-halving-explainer).

## Price increase after first halving

Bitcoin's price significantly increased after its first halving. The first halving happened on 11/28/2012, which cut block rewards for miners from 50 BTC to 25 BTC per block mined. Although not immediate, the price of bitcoin dramatically increased by $1,000 in one year's time.

* 11/28/2012- $12 per BTC
* 11/28/2013- $1,012 per BTC

In exactly one year after the first bitcoin halving the price increased by 8,333%. 

## Price increase after second halving 

Bitcoin's second halving proved to follow the same suit as the first. The second halving happened on 07/09/2016, which cut block rewards from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC per block mined. Similarly the price increase wasn't immediate, but in a year's time the price skyrocketed. 

* 07/09/2016- $662 per BTC
* 07/09/2017- $2,671 per BTC
* 12/17/2017- $19,635 per BTC

In exactly one year after the second bitcoin halving the price increased by 303%. After a year and five months, the price increased 2,866%. 

## What will bitcoin's price be after the third halving?

The first halving resulted in a 8,333% increase in price and the second halving yielded a 2,866%. 

Bitcoin has undoubtedly gained more popularity and investors since both the first and second halving. Expect there to be a dramatic increase after the third halving within one to two year's time.

There is a 65% difference between 8,333% and 2,866%. 65% of 2,866 is 1,863%. Using 1,863%, subtract it from 2,866% and it gives the result of 1,003%. 1,003% is the test number to increase bitcoin by for the third halving we can get our projection for bitcoin's price in 2021; a year or two after the third halving.

Over the past three weeks bitcoin has proven to have solid support at $5,800. Using $5,800 as bitcoins price next month in May, it can be multiplied by 1,003%. 

$5,800(1,003%)= $63,974

Bitcoin's expected price after the third halving is $63,974.

It's impossible to know where bitcoin's price will after the third halving, but expect it to be dramatically higher than what it is at the time of this writing ($6,822)."

35,2020-05-01,CD_Johanna,1,Thoughts on making a long term play on IBM with its new CEO?,"While many people are talking about Microsoft, Amazon, and Google in the cloud computing war, I think IBM could be the dark horse in the race.

Ginni Rometty ran the company into the ground, but I think Arvind Krishna could be the next Nadella.

He has a PhD in engineering and was the senior VP of cloud and cognitive software. He seems committed to artificial intelligence, cloud, quantum computing, and blockchain technology.

IBM has a strong balance sheet, moat, and dividend, it isn't going anywhere, and a P/E of 10.38.

My thought is that in 10 years, IBM can be a major again with its commitment to technology of the future. 

Anything I should consider before I start investing in it?"
