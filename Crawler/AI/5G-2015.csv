1,2015-12-14,encouragingSN,0,I'm Buying Sprint (S) Now,"I believe Sprint is incredibly undervalued, we are rapidly approaching the era of 5th generation mobile networks and 5G will be a game changer because it will allow mobile carriers to directly compete with traditional last mile Internet Service Providers. Comcast and Timewarner/Charter are going to have to make a choice soon, either buy Spring or T-Mobile to enter the wireless world, or choose to go forward as a last mile transport only that in 10 years will largely just be supporting fiber to wireless towers/equipment and large businesses, rather than residential services.

TLDR: Comcast will likely be buying Sprint in the next 3 years and competing directly with Verizon and AT&amp;T."
