0,2015-02-25,AiresGRC,1,An Investment Tool That Uses AI to Simulate Markets and Predict Their Next Move,"http://bit.ly/1AJYT9P

Nowadays investing in the stock market seems to be all about competing over pennies at sub-millisecond speed, requiring huge upfront investments in low-latency technology, in what is known as High-Frequency Trading. At the other end of the extreme, ordinary people are using mobile investing apps to simply automatically invest small amounts in passive index funds. Little attention however is going to approaches that actually aim to predict market movements by taking advantage of fundamental market inefficiencies. This is surprising, given today’s advances in artificial intelligence, big data and available computing power.

One such attempt though is made by Altreva, a company that specializes in financial time series forecasting and market modeling. Their Adaptive Modeler software uses evolutionary computing and simulation technology to create evolving market models that predict market movements.

What are your thoughts on this topic?"
1,2015-02-24,lotusfox,0,investing for futurists/trans-humanists?,"investing is great and all, but i love the idea of investing with a purpose in mind.  too support areas i want to see improvement in.


futurists tend to be interested in Robotics/Automation, Life Extension/Bio-Tech, and Artificial Intelligence.  they also like to support advancement in R&amp;D, infrastructure, and ethically investing in emerging markets.


currently i have $1200 invested in ETF's using Sharebuilder. ~$600 in  Vanguard HealthCare, ~300 in Vanguard InfoTech, and ~200 in Robo-stox. i'm a long long way from retirement.


are there any ETF's or other investment options I should check out or would be of interest to others?  i like making profits just like everyone else, but i wanna invest with style, in a way the helps build a better future.  i imagine most of you think i'm crazy, but good advice would be appreciated.  keep the ""don't do it!"" stuff to a minimum please. have some fun.  hum-drum investing is boring.
i'd eventually like to make an investment guide for other futurists/trans-humanists to check out.  "

4,2015-10-29,ArthurJMunoz,4,There's a huge gap between what $GOOGL is doing with driverless cars — and everybody else.,"[T]he technological differences are really just the beginning of the disruption Google has planned. In Google’s world, you won’t just quit driving cars, you’ll also quit owning them. Forget about investing in an expensive and depreciating asset that sits idle 97 percent of every day. Fleets of autonomous vehicles will circulate through your town, pick you up when you summon one via smartphone—or smartwatch or brain implant or whatever—drop you off, and move on to the next fare.

In other words, Google doesn’t want to sell you a consumer product, but a mobility service, says Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford professor of artificial intelligence who ran Google’s car project for four years until 2013. “Obviously, once you get into the pure services world, that’s the end of Detroit,” he says."
5,2015-12-12,MartEden,48,"Elon Musk, Amazon Create Artificial Intelligence Research Center","Several technology giants have banded together to invest $1 billion to research artificial intelligence, an increasingly important technology used in self-driving cars, facial recognition, and online advertising.

The effort, announced Friday, is designed “to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” said a blog post by the non-profit research company. Any advances will be made publicly available to help to spur innovation in the field.

The new company, OpenAI, is backed by donations from tech luminaries including Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and CEO of SpaceX; LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; PayPal co-founder and investor Peter Thiel; and Sam Altman and Jessica Livingston from the startup accelerator YCombinator. Corporate backers include Amazon’s cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, and Infosys.

The company expects to spend only a tiny fraction of the $1 billion donated over the next few years, according to its announcement."
