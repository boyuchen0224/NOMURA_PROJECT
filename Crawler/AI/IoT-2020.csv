0,2020-01-23,istockusername,1,Diversification through fractional shares,"I had a thought yesterday but I’m not sure if it makes sense.

Due to the possibilities of fractional shares and free trading wouldn't it make sense to create little indexes for yourself instead of picking just a few invidual stocks? I think this would be best for small investors that want to have diversified portfolio, limited budget and want to bet/invest on trends that might outperform for example the S&amp;P 500. Assuming that most ""Investor"" don't know the exact numbers behind every company it would also take out the risk kf picking the ""wrong"" stock.  

For example we all know 5G and IoT are supposed to be the next big thing. As far as I know there is no index on stocks that will benefit from 5G, so technically you could invest $1k into 20 biggest companies in that sector and each company have a 5% share. With to the fractional shares you could include stocks with a higher share price."
1,2020-02-13,rkirk0034,1,Penny for your thoughts...,"Could really use some opinions on the following:

Blackberry LTD. from investors interested in IoT/software. Think short term it’ll be relatively flat but see long term oppty here with their QNX &amp; cyber security platform. The vehicle applications and self driving move is a nice trend for them. They aren’t in the phone business anymore (thank god) but is this one on your radars at all?

Also - how would you guys manage your 401k allocation with Coronavirus. I see this becoming much worse and I’m stuck in a retirement date blended fund. Has anyone rebalanced on their own or leaving balls deep in equities? I think this whole thing is underestimated and just wanted to get a sense of what you’re doing."
2,2020-03-18,trading997,1,What stock and why?,"Title sums it up. Individual names only. What stocks are you eyeing up and why? The more unique the narrative the better! Would be great to have a master thread of names that people can sift through then dyor. I’ll start. 

CRSP. The google of gene editing, which I think has the potential to be a big thing. 

MAXR. Space exploration/geospatial mapping for IOT applications."
3,2020-03-02,De4thGr1n,1,Asking for Investment advice,"Hey guys,

I lurked around here mostly until now but I need the internet's wisdom to guide me to financial success.

I started a pretty well-paying job and I don't need that much money. I'm paying a mortgage out of it which takes about 40% of my income from this job I can easily live off another 30% of it and with the remaining money I want to start investing in the stock market.

I would obviously want to invest in a few places (not to put all my money on one horse so to speak).

I work in tech and I like tech and I have knowledge in tech.

I'm thinking of investing in stuff which I believe is gonna be around here for a while.
Tell me if you think these investments are a good idea (and generally if investing in stocks is a good idea)

So that includes
 nVidia: AMD has long lost this race and no-one is even giving a fight in the PC/Industrial GPU game anymore

 Intel : I don't see people turning from them in the next 10 years, not until Chinese manufacturers perfect their PC/industrial CPU game - Qualcomm for example could be a contester in the long run but right now they just make very good and effcient phone GPUs and CPUs

Qualcomm : more IoT = more small devices that require efficient CPUs at a low price I also believe that Chinese tech will soon (3-7 years) become a very big player in all markets 

And these are hardware stuff I think won't be replaced soon.

Looking at software, software seems a little more fragile and tricky to me  but my idea is that companies that have a strong government back for intelligence/espionage reasons will survive and possibly be a strong stock in the long run:

Facebook, Google (NSA)
Baidu, Tencent (Chinese intelligence) 
Yandex (whatever the KGB calls itself these days)



These is also:
VMware - recently bought black carbon and I believe intends on expanding their cyber security capabilities (which was what they were missing) as well as being the no. 1 Virtual machine vendor available and slowly becoming more and more prevelent in organizations silently taking over the entire VM market (their only real competition in terms of enterprises is MS's Hyper-V which is a joke) 

But I feel that was more of a hunch.


Also, 
I thought about the military/weapon industry but it seems like an area which is dependent on who gets contracts and who doesn't and there isn't enough security in that (or at least so I believe). There are some exceptions, companies that stayed around and probably will continue to stay around:
Lockhead Martin (probably gonna continue to work with the US Air Force on more improvements to the F-35 and more drones which seems to be a weapon of choice for POTUS as well as all armies around the world ) 

Any company manufacturing mass surveillance systems seem to be a good idea to me.


If you got to here, First of all, thank you for reading. 


Are there any pointers you could give me? 
What is safer what is not-so-much,misconceptions I might have about this. 
How risky is this stock market business and so on.
Is this a good idea (stock market)

Any methods I might want to use or things that would benefit me when doing stocks.


Thank you again"
4,2020-04-26,1aleccio1,1,5 company portfolio for the year 2030,"Say you have to create a portfolio that reflects your opinion on what industries will see the most growth in the coming decade(s). This portfolio has to contain exactly 5 stocks, which you will have to hold for the next 10+ years. What five stocks do you choose and why?
Personally, I believe that the future lies within AI, 5G and overall IOT. Now, I might be completely wrong - but would like to hear what you guys and gals think.

My 5 company portfolio:
1. Alibaba ($BABA)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. Square Inc. ($SQ)
4. Slack ($WORK)
5. Skyworks Solutions ($SWKS)

Runner ups:
- Microsoft
- Tencent
- Nvidia
- Uber

The stocks I chose reflect a my vision of what companies will see the most growth in the next decade."
5,2020-04-03,3STmotivation,1,Portfolio consisting of 50% tech stocks (pros and cons discussion),"With all the talk of 5G, IoT, AI and new software dominating the markets for the next decade, would it be a mistake to build a portfolio that for 50% consists of stocks in the tech field or would it be the best move in order to try and get the most returns?

Examples of the tech stocks I am referring to:
Alphabet... Microsoft... Apple... Nvidea... Honeywell... Qualcomm... Intel... Facebook... Baidu... AMD... Micron...

The risk should be obvious, with so many companies in the same sector it makes a portfolio incredibly vulnerable to a sudden collapse. Another risk is the fact that most of these companies are competing with each other on one or multiple fronts, which means that not all of them can come out on top and give the return on investment so many are hoping for.

The upsides are just as obvious though, the tech sector is growing at an incredible rate and the development of new technologies will continue to become a bigger and bigger part of the every day life of people. Investing in these companies is an investment in the present, but even more so in the future of the market.

What is your opinion on this? How are you building your portfolio with an eye for the future?"
6,2020-05-05,codingprofessor,1,Some small-med cap stocks (~10B and under) that I'm studying during lockdown,"\- Cloudflare

Cloudflare has been around for a long time in many notable pockets of the internet. I think the need and importance of content-delivery  is only to increase with the development of cloud networking. Many that argue that ""Google and Amazon could just replace them"" aren't seeing how important it is to just be dedicated as as security company.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Dennys  
They have a bunch of real-estate and are a pretty important part of American logistics.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Draft Kings

Company that's been around for a long time that's starting to play ball in the legal app world. They're also well connected after many years of word-of-mouth building.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Groupon

A tech dinosaur. I'm examining this stock after the recent acquisition of Honey (amazon coupon scraper) from Paypal for 4 billon dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Planet Fitness

I think they've executed pretty well over the years. It's pretty hard to beat a servicable $10 gym that focuses on cleanliness and casual exercising. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Nissan

They have a pretty messy history and I'm taking a look at their attempts to turn it around.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think theyre the more focused version of Uber that focuses more on customer satisfaction  and acquisition over innovation and spread.

&amp;#x200B;

\- KSU 

Rail that extends from the US to mexico

&amp;#x200B;

\- Calavo Growers

These are avocado distributers in the US that work with Walmart

&amp;#x200B;

\- Blackberry

 appreciate their refocus on secure IOT networking

&amp;#x200B;

\- Weed stocks

\- Logitech

\- Proto Labs (3D printing)
