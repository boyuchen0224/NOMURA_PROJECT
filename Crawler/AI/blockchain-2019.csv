What you think about it?,"Since 5 months I am looking into Security Tokens (basically traditional financial products that will be digitized and put onto the blockchain) As a result, Security Tokens will represent the ownership to an underlying asset that has a tangible value, such as real-estate, stock, bond or a piece of art.

5,2019-01-21,FFC_Media,1,Top Trends in Blockchain Industry for 2019,"Edithor-in-Chief at FFC Media predicted how the blockchain industry will evolve for 2019.

Here is his forecast.

## Top Trends in Blockchain Industry for 2019

**1. Venture capital will return to the industry.** Everything returns to normal. The wave of “simple” ICOs has subsided and the time of STO has passed. Organizing IEO (financing through exchanges) is almost as difficult as conducting an IPO. Good old venture — the optimal ratio of the cost of capital to the cost of its attraction.

**2. We will see a lot of M*****&amp;*****A deals.** For example, Citi and Credit Agricole banks have acquired a stake in the SETL blockchain startup which works under support for calculations based on distributed technology. Large institutional investor Digital Currency Group participates in Revelator startup, which manages digital copyrights. Shell bought Applied Blockchain to use it in its own business. Fat cats will continue to acquire small and effective cryptoprojects.

**3. The distributed ledgers technologies will be more widely used for accounting of financial transactions.** Banks, financial brokers, exchanges (especially crypto exchanges) will increasingly use DLT in traditional business. They have nowhere to escape because blockchain does not allow them manipulating reports and changing documents retroactively. Self‐respecting structures will use a distributed ledgers to ensure transaction immutability. The use of the blockchain may become a “quality mark” for financial companies over times.

**4. Blockchain‐as‐a‐Service model will become a driver of industry growth.** Obviously, using the “boxed” technology from the cloud is easier than creating your own blockchain architecture. Many services are provided on cloud technology nowadays and blockchain is no exception. This trend is confirmed by the fact that Intel, Microsoft and Amazon are already offering blockchain‐as‐a‐service solutions. Big players get involved only in big stories.

6,2019-01-17,RoyCangjian,1,"Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple: The Biggest Crypto Collabs and Partnerships"," 

 **Bitcoin** 

It’s rumored that institutional investors are accumulating Bitcoin through OTC markets despite bearish market sentiment. Whilst retail investors are panicking, institutional investors are said to be acquiring Bitcoin – an assumption that leaves many wondering as to why markets have not yet shown many signs of recovery when a.k.a smart money is flowing into the space.  

Professional traders and institutional investors are highly cautious about accumulating new assets and are experts at acquiring them without affecting the market. There are a variety of hedge funds that are solely focused on investing in Bitcoin and venture capital funds that have begun to provide the necessary financial support for upcoming startups that have dedicated themselves to building applications and services for the Bitcoin ecosystem.During bear markets, institutional investors prefer bitcoin over altcoins due to positive sentiment and because BTC is the most established cryptocurrency.

The SEC has denied multiple Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications as cryptocurrency enthusiasts eagerly await the approval of the first Bitcoin ETF. Many are betting on the institutionalization of Bitcoin once new yet traditional investment vehicles are made available to investors.

 

**Ripple**

Unlike most decentralized projects, Ripple is focused on connecting banks, payment service providers, digital asset exchanges and corporates through blockchain technology. Although XRP, the cryptocurrency used by Ripple’s xRapid, is accused of being centralized, it remains popular due to the fact that investors recognize the compelling value proposition of connecting existing financial institutions and remittance services using distributed ledger technology.Originally released in 2012, Ripple has managed to build up an extensive list of clientele that consists of public banks, central banks, tech companies and corporations. The value here is the Ripple network that provides a reliable solution to moving assets quickly around the world, which is being utilized by banks to shift money between different foreign countries.

**Ethereum**

By far the most utilized blockchain protocol for businesses to issue their own native digital currency token, Ethereum allows smart contract functionality that has managed to get the attention of large institutions and corporations. Whilst Ethereum is classified as a decentralized project, it has managed to attract companies like Microsoft, Samsung, LG, Intel, AMD, BP and financial institutions like JP Morgan, CME group, Scotiabank and Commerzbank.

Due to the sheer popularity of the project, Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA), consisting of over 300 members, was formed to help connect established organizations with blockchain developers interested in building applications on top of Ethereum.

**Aergo**

An upcoming fourth generation blockchain project that plans to help enterprises make use of distributed ledger technology, Aergo is based on the proprietary software known as Coinstack.

Aergo is a hybrid blockchain that is open to the public and designed to help large-scale enterprises deploy their own preferred blockchain. Renowned VC fund Sequoia Capital, known for focusing on the technology industry and backing Forbes 500 companies, is one of many VC firms investing in Aergo, along with FBG, GBIC, Arrington XRP, Dekrypt, Rockaway, Neo Global and Divergence Digital.The project will help enterprises adopt blockchain technology by making it easy to design and build decentralized applications on private or public chains or a mix of both. Aergo plans to provide Blocko, Korea’s number one blockchain infrastructure provider, with a more decentralized solution to service its existing clients including Shinhan Bank, Samsung, Lotte Card, KRX and the South Korean government.

**OmiseGo**

A decentralized payment solution provider as well as a bank, exchange and blockchain gateway for businesses, OmiseGo was created by parent company Omise, a venture-backed payment service company operating in Japan, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand.Omise is a popular payment gateway solution in Asia, well-established in Thailand and backed by large corporations such as McDonald’s, Burger King, Allianz, Axxa and SCG. The company has been showing impressive growth since its inception in 2013. It’s expected that once OmiseGo is fully operational with its mainnet release, Omise merchants will switch over to the decentralized blockchain network

**Vechain**

A project aiming to disrupt the supply management industry by leveraging a blockchain-based platform that digitizes the supply chain and tackles goods counterfeiting, Vechain is essentially a Blockchain-as-a-Service company that plans to build a trust-free network for businesses to collaborate and track inventory in a decentralized ecosystem.By deploying a public distributed ledger, Vechain hopes to enhance supply chain management by combining the ***Internet of Things (IoT)*** with blockchain technology. Manufacturers can easily track and manage supplies, as all the information is made available on Vechain’s public blockchain. Consumers will also have the ability to determine the quality and authenticity of the products sold. The project has secured a few high-level partnerships with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the government of Gui’an, Shanghai Waigaoqiao’s Direct Imported Goods Sales Centre, DNV GL, BMW and China Unicom.  


**Icon**

A project dedicated to helping enterprises deploy their own distributed ledgers, ICON is an independent chain that connects multiple community sidechains, enabling cross-platform data and value communication.Positioned in South Korea, a country that is considered to be the most crypto friendly nation in Asia, ICON has established a variety of strategic partnerships with large corporations such as Line, Samsung Electronics, Smilegate and SK Planet. The project is diversifying its reach by collaborating with the Korean government on numerous initiatives in the healthcare, education, insurance and customs sectors.Vasilios FilipVasilios Filip got into Bitcoin back in 2015, believing that distributed ledger technology will disrupt traditional financial services and banks. With a background in law and economics, he has since kept his eye on blockchain applications whilst dedicating his time writing about anything crypto-related.

9,2019-01-15,cpclos,1,[Hidden Forces Special] ETC 51% Attack and What It Means for Proof-of-Work and Crypto Exchanges | Haseeb Qureshi,"Demetri Kofinas speaks with Haseeb Qureshi of MetaStable Capital about the recent 51% attack against Ethereum Classic, its implications for exchanges that continue to list smaller market-cap cryptos like ETC, Dash, Monero, etc., and what it means for the debate between proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.

On January 5th, 2019, the digital currency exchange Coinbase detected a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. In order to protect customer funds, they immediately paused interactions with the ETC blockchain. Coinbase reported the 51% attack on January 7, 2019, but a few people on Twitter had already become aware that something wasn’t right with ETC. Pierre Rochard, an emerging thought-leader in the Bitcoin space, asked ETC developer Donal McIntyre on Twitter:  “Was there a deep reorg on Ethereum Classic yesterday?… 75 blocks deep I hear, with a double-spend.” Donal McIntyre replied: “Well ETC is still small and has many enemies so an attack with sufficient GPU power may be plausible, but I will check with others in the ecosystem.”

Demetri and Haseeb explore the reasons why the price of ETC was largely unaffected, what this latest attack means for the listing (or delisting) of similarly sized cryptocurrencies, and how this is sparking a larger debate about the efficacy of proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake as mechanisms for securing a cryptocurrency.

11,2019-01-08,PowerDubs,1,Atari on the move,"Take this info, make what you want of it, and lets discuss...

Seems most of the people who have LinkedIn profiles that said working on the 'Atari Token project' all just changed from that back to Infinity Network on their pages- which is the company that Atari licensed to create the token. (and by doing so Atari acquired a 15% stake in that company)

Yes- could mean the project ceased without an announcement.

But- it also ties in with the given timelines presented at various venues, as the 'private token sales rounds' were slated to be complete in Q4 2018.

With Atari just publicly announcing they made a deal with Animoca for blockchain gaming- seems unlikely everything suddenly, but quietly fell apart a week later with everyone involved in the initial build team.

Soo- take what you want out of it.  

Myself- I don't see the co-founder of the Atari Token going to Richard Branson's private island last fall, sitting and talking on his couch (in a Atari Token t-shirt no less, photo tagged w/ #Atari, #blockchain, #Crypto), and then playing tennis with Branson as something that just happens without reason, and without potential.  

Also not forgetting that Anthony Di Iorio commited as honorary co-founder of the token as well.

Pretty substantial people for nothing to be happening.  And with Atari just joining the NasDaq, it would seem they expect growth as well.

I hope this is allowed to remain open for discussion, as it appears the people involved are 'major' enough to have an impact."

Blockchain has become an incredibly popular concept in the tech  world. However, as an experienced product manager, as well as blockchain  expert, I have come to a conclusion that despite all the hype,  blockchain is not useful for anything in the real world.

To  find out why I am skeptical, explore the Q&amp;A below. It is written in a simple form of questions and answers.

Institutional investors should consider dipping their toes into cryptocurrencies, according to Cambridge Associates, a consultant for pensions and endowments.

“Despite the challenges, we believe that it is worthwhile for investors to begin exploring this area today with an eye toward the long term,’’ said analysts at Boston-based Cambridge in a research note published Monday. “Though these investments entail a high degree of risk, some may very well upend the digital world.’’


Most large institutions have steered clear of the 10-year-old, $120 billion industry because it’s largely unregulated and cryptocurrencies have been used to finance illicit trade. The collapse in crypto prices hasn’t helped either: Bitcoin, the largest digital currency, lost about 75 percent of its value in 2018.


For those prepared to take the plunge, Cambridge recommends “a considerable amount of time learning about the space,” including surveying the different ways of investing, from illiquid venture capital funds to buying tokens on an exchange. The firm advises institutions that manage more than $300 billion.

Institutional investments, though rare, bring cheer to crypto enthusiasts who say a wave of institutional investment could bring greater credibility to the market.

Two pension plans in Fairfax County, Virginia, this month invested in a venture-capital fund for the blockchain and digital assets industry. Last year Yale University invested in a fund focused on early-stage projects focused on cryptocurrencies, new blockchains and exchanges.

“The dramatic declines that swept across the crypto space raised questions about the future of these assets and the blockchain technology that underpins them,’’ the analysts said. “Yet, in looking across the investment landscape, we see an industry that is developing, not faltering.’’"
23,2019-02-11,fgz003,1,"OK, HERE WE GO","Hello everybody. 
I know that all of you are investors and looking for new ideas. 
I am also pretty sure, you all have invested or have heard about blockchain and cryptocurrency , like bitcoin ,Binance, Ethereum, DDPT, etc... and even invested in them as it showed from you users names.
The 1st idea i want to talk about is the decentralized travel using blockchain technology for travel. Maybe you also have heard of it, but I dont know if you do realize its future potential. 
To begin with, Decentralized travel is relatively new, but has a bright future, which makes it a good opportunity for investors. Also, It is growing fast, which is a good sign. 
 It is true that decentralized travel uses digital tokens, but what makes it different from other  currencies is that it provides travel services that we can make use of. Airlines ticket, hotels car rental agencies, etc at lower costs.
I am specifically talking about Xceltrip, the innovator at using blockchain technology for travel. It uses the XcelToken
 XcelToken, a first of its kind utility token, backed by the XcelTrip is listed in LATOKEN Exchange and will be available for trading on 25 March 2019.
LATOKEN is a rapidly growing Top-30 crypto exchange focusing on providing liquidity for new tokens: 
●    $140+ million daily turnover

●    120,000+ registered traders

●   250+ crypto pairs available for trading

XcelTrip also  accepts now  Ethereum and DDPT,  for every hotel bookings. They have over 500,000 hotels around the globe, where you can spend with Binance, Bitcoin, XcelToken and now with Ethereum and DDPT too.
Plus, they are soon releasing Flight Booking collaborating with 150 plus airlines. You can use all these tokens to book hotels and flights.

This is just to give you an idea about the future potential hiding within this company.
 You can have a peek at their website and even register for free. Nothing to loose, right!
It is easy to check it out , and if somebody wants me to give him a link to visit, i would be more happy to do so.
 Hope this 1st idea was helpful to some of you, otherwise i would be very embarrassed if all of you you think it was a waste of time reading this article

""The World's Fastest, Most Secure and Easy to Use Currency""

​

What is Electra?

Simply stated, Electra is a cutting-edge digital currency for the future ... available today. Envision a daywhen your money is 100% secure and yet instantaneously accessible. Well that day is today and that currency is Electra.

Many factors today threaten traditional fiat currencies such as devaluation from money printing by theEuropean Central Bank and United States Treasury, currency manipulation by rogue nations, securitybreaches and theft and financial central planning. Electra is the answer to the problems plaguingtraditional fiat currencies and the technology behind Electra is what makes it a superior currency option.

​

Electra's Superior Technology

Electra provides the solution for a fast, secure and easy to use currency that cannot be devalued, massproduced or gamed to give anyone an advantage. To achieve this, Electra uses the most secureblockchain technology ever created to ensure impenetrable security and instantaneous access to yourmoney. Electra's core technology is known as the NISTS blockchain which comprises the best advancesfrom the top five blockchain finalists that competed in a five-year long blockchain competition at theUnited States' National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST) between 2007 and 2012. Besidesbulletproof security, other key components of NISTS include a lightning fast algorithm for instantaneousaccess to your money with ultra-low energy consumption making Electra a superior and environmentally sustainable currency.

​

Electra's Supply

Electra has solved currency valuation concerns while ensuring future supply by incorporating a Proof-ofStakesystem that rewards active currency holders (nodes) for participating in a decentralized networkwith other nodes. Together these connected nodes verify and approve blockchain activity and keepidentical copies of all transactions, known as a ledger. Since the ledger is replicated and shared amongall nodes, manipulation is impossible. In return for verifying and approving blockchain transactions, anode is rewarded 2.5% of their respective currency holdings on an annualized basis. Beginning inOctober of 2019, the reward will be halved each year for the next seven years until it stabilizes at 0.02%annually in October of 2025. lt's important to note that the world's population is growing atapproximately 1.1% annually so Electra has ensured, that in time, there will be an appreciation of itscurrency by creating new supplies as a slower rate than world population growth. Oversupply oftraditional fiat currencies like Eurosand UDS's has eroded their buying power by 95% in the last 100 years.

​

Electra's Availablllty

At the time this was written, in December of 2018, there were approximately 29.2 billion Electra incirculation allowing for nearly anyone and everyone interested in investing in Electra's future to acquirethis cutting-edge digital currency of the future. This abundant avairability has helped distribute Electraworldwide and attract many people into the Electra community. At the time of this writing there areapproximately 17,000 Twitter followers, 12,000 Discord followers, and 9,000 Telegram followers and the community is growing rapidly.

​

Electra's Communlty Provides the Power

Electra's community of over 30,000 investors, followers and believers is growing daily and provides thepower behind this amazing currency. Electra was born in summer of 2017 by a developer with a visionof creating a ""safe, long-term, sustainable, self-governing cryptocurrency'' as stated in an interview inOctober 2018. Within the community, Electra's founder is known as EOl and has chosen to remainanonymous to keep the focus on the project and community rather than himself. In a recent interviewwith EOl, he stated that his identity would be revealed in due time. Today, Electra is supported entirelyby its community of volunteers which helps ensure its long-term viability from truly committedindividuals and also conserves valuable resources.

As Electra's community grows so does its potential for mass adoption with merchants, online stores,Point-of-Sale retailers and as a private payment option between individuals.

​

Transacting with ElectraPay

Electra can be used for any financial transactions with an easy to use mobile, web or desktop wallet.Like a traditional wallet, Electra's wallets are applications available for iOS and Android devices thatprovide secure and instantaneous access to your money.

Any merchant with a Magento, WooCommerce or Shopify based website can easily download a simpleplugin to allow them to begin accepting Electra payments. One of the best features of the Electrapayment system, known as ElectraPay, is that each merchant can select the currency they'd like toreceive in exchange for Electra. A merchant's preferred currency will be deposited into their bankautomatically without any effort or cost to them.

As an example, if someone pays a merchant with Electra from their mobile wallet, that merchant canselect to receive Electra, Euros, USD's or any other fiat or digital currency of their choosing. Thisexchange from one currency to another is seamless and costs the merchant nothing. What makes theexchange possible from one currency to another is what's known as an Atomic Swap. When someonesubmits their Electra payment to a merchant, an exchange rate between the two currencies isimmediately established from a public currency exchange and a contract is established between thebuyer and merchant that either can cancel without the need of a trusted third-party. Because of thecontract between the buyer and merchant, transactions are instantaneous and secure.

​

Electra's SocialPay

To allow for easy payments and donations within social networks like FaceBook, Weibe, lnstagram andother social media platforms, Electra's SocialPay is an application that easily allows users to transact anddonate to their favorite charities with Electra. Similar to online merchant payments, social mediapayments and donation recipients can select to receive Electra, Euros, USD's or any other fiat or digital currency of their choosing.

​

Electra's Foundation &amp; Future

On October 12, 2018, Electra's core team members established a legal entity in the Netherland calledthe Electra Project. The Electra Project foundation received 300MM Electra from founder, EOl for thepurposes of developing and promoting this cutting-edge digital currency. Long-term the foundation willbecome the recipient of donations and grants to further develop the world's Fastest, Most Secure and Easy to Use Currency."

Major adoption of the technology will include, but not limited to, healthcare, automobile, banking, and logistics sectors. The global economy is set to be disrupted in the positive direction, with the adoption of Blockchain as a platform.

In order to understand [**blockchain technology**](https://techindustan.com/understanding-blockchain-technology/), we need to dive in into its past.

**What are the early origins of Blockchain?**

While many people may confuse the origins of Blockchain with Bitcoin, the history of the technology goes deeper. Bitcoin was a core offering that was based on the Blockchain ecosystem. Bitcoin was one of the main reasons why blockchain came to the spotlight.

**The five major milestones in Blockchain**

If you are want to invest in cryptocurrency then understanding Blockchain technology is important for you. Collating the history of Blockchain, analysts have pegged five major milestones that have contributed to how well integrated Blockchain is today. These 5 major peaks in the Blockchain have shown us the scale of the technology and the potential of its adoption.

* **The cryptocurrency revolution**
* **The separation of coin and Blockchain**
* **Smart contracts and new use-cases**
* **Proof of stake in Blockchain**
* **Scaled adoption of Blockchain**

**The future of Blockchain Technology**

What does the future hold for Blockchain technologies? Increased adoption and more use-cases. When it comes to core innovation, developers are designing new innovations within the core technology. With better data management processes and operational excellencies there is a wider scope of adoption in Blockchain. Analysts are also predicting that Blockchain, as a whole, will be worth around $2.3 billion in 2021. The future looks bright for the technology."

29,2019-03-22,ccedk_pro,1,Guide to the Most Popular Blockchain Platforms," Blockchain-based applications use a distributed ledger to track transaction details, where every user’s computer stores a copy of the transaction record. While originally used to underpin cryptocurrency transactions, the technology has quickly evolved to serve a wide range of business practices, solving a whole host of previously unattainable challenges.

Aware of this, many businesses are looking to build solutions either internally or by contracting developers. While it’s still possible for companies to build their proprietary blockchain architecture to support the application, that adds time and complexity to the development cycle.

Luckily, there’s a wide range of blockchain platforms available to allow developers to focus on adapting the platform to fit their needs rather than starting from scratch. When deciding which route to take, you’ll want to compare the features of the available platforms in relation to your needs.

32,2019-03-15,OmarPreston,0,Kelsey Coin to become USA Official Currency by end of 2019,"This is an excerpt from a recent article posted by 21-year old self-proclaimed trillionaire tech entrepreneur Chris Kelsey:

Kelsey Coin has already become the world’s only currency. With that being said, the USA is the first country to recognize Kelsey Coin as its official currency. During this process, existing banking systems run by companies such as Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Bank of America, etc. will shut down.

One of the main concerns regarding Kelsey Coin’s future is system security as we don’t use illegitimate concepts such as blockchain. The truth of the matter is that it won’t matter. There are many different ways to ensure complete account security and we will take all required measures to do so.

Certain government sectors including the Federal Reserve will no longer have a purpose and therefore will be shut down entirely. I am not concerned regarding any potential “lost jobs” because Kelsey Coin will stabilize the economy so that petty work is no longer required. Automation of course will aid this process and we need to stop acting like these jobs are necessary.

It is very likely that a number of other countries will recognize Kelsey Coin as their official currency this year but the USA is the only country I can say for certain as of now. It is important to educate the world on how to use Kelsey Coin and its related platforms (World Home and Black Market World). I recently wrote an article that details everything you need to know about Kelsey Coin — here is the link. We will be keeping everyone up to date regarding upcoming Kelsey Coin news. In the meantime, I’m excited to be taking part in bringing such immense positive change to the world."
33,2019-03-11,milad-engineer,1,Can it be in Russia working blockchain economy system?," 

The main problem in the modern Russian economy: the population becomes poorer faster than before. The analysis of statistical data shows that the population of the country becomes poorer much faster than in the period of the financial and economic crisis that arose as a result of the US mortgage crisis. It should be noted that by the end of 2018, the number of goods bought by Russians decreased greatly. The current stats significantly exceeds the figure that was characteristic of the Russian economy during the 1998 crisis.

The bad news is that the indicators, which determine future economic growth - primarily investments - have fallen much.  
According to the President of Sberbank, the use of blockchain technology will be an impulse to the development of the high-tech sector of the economy and its development prospects.  
The interest of Russian government in new economic models, capable to shake up the current economy of the country and attracting new investments, becomes quite understandable. The blockchain and cryptocurrency can act as a bridge.  
The general questions, which should be answered:

* Will the blockchain be able to change the current situation of Russian citizens?
* Is the Russian government able to assess Blockchain technology?
* Will the cryptocurrency status be equal to the ruble in 2019?
* Does the Russian government consider cryptocurrency as a solution for improvements or an opportunity to impose new taxes on the population?
* Will Russia start developing new blockchain or consider the possibility of using existing platforms like Waves, Credits or Bitfury?
* Will 2019 be the beginning of new reformations in the Russian economy and the beginning of blockchain use in real life sectors?

Let’s make a logical constructive discussion here and try to find answers to mentioned above questions."

46,2019-04-14,CryptoPhantom13,0,"Cereneum, A New Interest-Bearing Token On Ethereum.","Cereneum is a brand new concept in cryptocurrency: a time-based interest-bearing Cryptographic Certificate of Interest (CCOI) on the Blockchain. Airdrops are given based on five of the most popular PoW cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Earn interest by staking your Cereneum for set periods of time.

The rate of interest you earn is based on how long you stake your Cereneum as well as the amount of the stake. Cereneum uses Pooled Interest, which means interest paid to stakers is higher when less tokens are staked. Stake periods can vary from one week to as long as five years, with the interest rising with the length of the stake. The more Cereneum that is staked the lower the supply available on the market, which can mean higher prices.

Unclaimed tokens are redistributed daily to stakers during the course of the year-long claiming period, greatly increasing their holdings.

Early unstakers are penalized, with those penalties distributed among current stakers. Additionally, there are bonuses available to those that utilize the referral program.

Foreword

It's clear that cryptocurrencies are gradually making inroads into the global economy, moving closer to mass adoption. Cryptocurrencies offer a number of advantages - decentralization and trust, lower commissions and disintermediation - that make it easier for users to carry out their daily transactions. Anybody can transfer value around the globe, winning from fast processing time.

In comparison, sending value across borders via legacy financial systems requires lengthy waiting periods and fees, while also making users stuck into highly complex processes. For instance, if a person from Japan wants to send some money to England, the fees can range anywhere from 5% up to 10%, depending on the system being used. In addition, there will be some currency conversion fees. It seems that centrali paradigm shift change, bringing to the table lightning speeds and lower fees. Although cryptocurrencies have been winning more and more attention from merchants worldwide, there's still a 
number of roadblocks to wider adoption, among which are price volatility, scalability limitations and others.

Volatility is admittedly the biggest hurdle that prevents businesses from using cryptocurrencies more. Bitcoin can experience huge fluctuations in just a matter of hours or even minutes. In addition, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum present scalability issues, which results in high processing time. A merchant, who has to handle hundreds of payments on a daily basis, would not be able to conduct their business efficiently if transactions get stuck for days on end. On top of that, it's extremely hard for adopters to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat via the banks and other financial agents they usually work with.

Either way, you wouldn’t be on this page wondering how to get really rich with your own business. No worries, here you’ll realize what things you can do with the money amount already available in your pocket.

We’ve already seen in [our article](https://blog.s-pro.io/invest-money-business-become-millionaire/) what options are there for you when your goal is to earn some interest. Even more, those methods over time can bring really inspiring results for everyone. [In this piece of work](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-invest-money-business/), I've concentrated more on the last specified option – business. There are many reasons for that. Probably the most important one is that business can bring the biggest revenue out of all other investment options.

## What are the most profitable businesses?

There are uncountable possibilities in every niche. Just check out the empty cells in the Startup Matrix we already described in [our post](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-brainstorm-new-startup-ideas-the-startup-idea-matrix/). We can start listing the actual spheres that are in need of fresh new ideas. But to be of more help to you we better concentrate on the directions in businesses that can be applied to almost every business niche.

What unites every other direction is technology. It has already changed the way all businesses function around the world. There more or less progress here or there, but it is definitely the biggest trend nowadays.

Entrepreneurs are stepping into the tech world with joy because it has already proven the positive effect that tech inclusions do with businesses by scaling them with ease.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning will take away manual operations transforming the way industries will work within just a few years.

### Online business

People are getting more aware of the benefits of online transactions, communication systems and other online platforms offer. Have you considered how much more convenient it is to use contactless payments?

There were many challenges that online businesses have already overcome and continue successfully dealing with nowadays.

### Artificial Intelligence

There have been many debates around AI for years. Nowadays it gets more and more popular and is expected to bring new products with [AI implemented](https://blog.s-pro.io/ai-driven-development-as-an-innovative-market-tendency/) in 2019 and further years.

With AI data analytics will be on hype as artificial intelligence operates with behavioral data of each user.

### Blockchain

Even though the hype around blockchain has been decreased lately, it still has great potential in [transforming all the business niches and everyone’s lives](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-change-the-world-for-the-better-or-our-utopian-future-with-blockchain/). Due to its benefits where the major ones are anonymity, security and interchangeability it has already been implemented in a number of big projects and continues to be in demand.

These are just a few major trends that will rule the business world and continue to be implemented in all areas of our lives. The core feature that unites all of them is an online presence. The mobility it gives to consumers is much appreciated by them. People are getting to feel the benefits of not be tied up to a certain location.

What comes to your mind when you think about mobility? Possibly mobile devices and the growing number of various mobile applications already implemented and growing. The thing is all the mentioned trends can be implemented in businesses via web and mobile applications.

**So without further ado, we are concluding that the most profitable businesses will be for sure connected with the** [apps developed to serve](https://s-pro.io/en/) **the described needs thus attracting more and more audience to any product you already have or only have in mind.**"

* A genuine State Sharding approach: effectively partitioning the chain state into multiple shards, handled in parallel by different participating validators.
* Secure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism: an improved variation of Proof of Stake (PoS) that ensures long term security and distributed fairness, while eliminating the need for energy intensive PoW algorithms.

### Features &amp; Highlights

* **Adaptive State Sharding**: Comparable in throughput as to centralized counterparts. Our architecture goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an augmentation of the existing models, improving the performance while focusing to achieve a better nash equilibrium state between security, scalability and decentralization.
* **Secure Proof of Stake**: Minimal energy and computational requirements. Elrond eliminates the need for intensive PoW consensus algorithms and proposes a novel and more robust Secure Proof of Stake consensus, enhancing intra-shard communication and pruning the blockchain state to the most essential.
* **Decentralized**: Increased security due to the randomly selected block proposer. Elrond introduces an improvement which adds security and reduces latency, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus group (block proposer and validators) at the beginning of a round. This is possible because the last block’s aggregated signature is used as the randomization factor.

63,2019-05-22,JoeReviewer,0,To buy a diamond is not a problem anymore,"1. Historically diamonds have been traded on inclosed B2B exchange platforms. Marketplace is a space open for any kind of audience and any kind of business relations including P2P and B2C.   
 2. A marketplace is able to gather in one place individual diamond holders, buyers, diamond cutters, jewelers, as well as those involved in the gemstone business. Individual holder will be able to sell diamonds not only to jeweler, but to any interested person across the whole world.  
3. Marketplace can be an excellent option not only for those who want to buy a valuable gift for beloved one at a reasonable price, but also for those who want to open their own online jewelry store. There is no need to make a website, promote it, rent an office or a warehouse. DOM has everything ready. Marketplace opportunities are enough to organize and coordinate small and medium businesses.  
 4. Until now market monopolists evaluate diamonds themselves, trying to get the maximum profit from each client. Markups of jewellery stores turn diamonds into an unreasonably expensive item. Having bought a diamond in such a store, it won't be possible to sell it back for the same amount. The marketplace will gather diamonds from individual owners and sellers who will compete with each other, offering buyers the most attractive prices.  
5. When you buy a diamond in jewelry store or from speculator, the data on the deal is never entered into any database, which can be used in case you want to sell the stone. A modern marketplace, like Diamond Open Market, will store data on every deal in the blockchain where this information can be checked and verified at any time.  
All together this will create new opportunities for all the diamond market participants."

They want to utilize the ethereum blockchain to be a shareholders book and have issued security tokens that represent common and preferred shares of the company. Most importantly they have issued a prospectus that is fully compliant as per FINMA (Swiss authorities). I know you guys are really hating on crypto/blockchain related businesses, but in this case they are a brick and mortar company with a proven track record, most famous for building around half of the underground subway network in a European capital. They want to fundraise for their mining as they are the owners of concessions of reserves valued at around 4,3 billion dollars, they just need to extract the commodities. The only relation to crypto they have is the hybrid approach of issuing tokens that represent shares. They already have an ISIN.

1. Overview
2. The two digital bonds: BOSS-101 and Bond-i
3. BOSS-101
4. Bond-i
5. Conclusion

**Overview**

Needless to say, technology has changed the way the world of finance works. With the start of the digital revolution, the market for sustainable investing has evolved. Not only the financial instruments have become more digital, the database technology for financial products has also ripened. Sustainable finance has always stood at the forefront of big markets and only a technology that could be used

1. to provide large-scale financing to fund the projects,
2. make financial transactions behind the projects efficient, transparent, and secure,
3. streamline financial transactions in every corner of the globe, and
4. make financial transactions a matter of seconds

could be trusted for revolutionizing the finance industry. Blockchain is one such technology that allows financial institutions to have a single verifiable continuous record of information through a distributed asset register instead of registering transactions in a central system with a stored ledger. Since blockchain is a secure distributed ledger, only those with permission; can access the records. Participants can securely hold and trade the assets in a matter of seconds using blockchain powered platforms. In a nutshell, blockchain enables investors to trade the highest quality investments faster, more efficiently and with reduced risk.

The digitization of financial instruments, especially bonds will lead to an increase in investments. Digitization of bonds on the blockchain is thriving manifold, as there is now a bold move to fully automate the bond trading process. A few protocols are being set to handle scenarios for different kinds of bond trades, including buying a different bond with the sale of bonds, or of hedging the money from the sale of bonds. This will positively impact the liquidity on the market.

**The Two Digital Bonds: BOSS-101 and Bond-i**

Having said that, let’s discuss the two important blockchain-based digital bonds that are all over the media nowadays:

The two bonds that we will be discussing in this article are:

**1.** **BOSS-101**

TradeFinex, an open standards protocol for global trade and finance, that mitigates counterparty risks by making financial instruments liquid and interoperable has launched Bond Open Smart-Contracts Standard (BOSS)-101. The standard allows financial institutions to issue bonds on the XinFin Mainnet.

**2. Bond-i**

Bond-i is the world’s first digital bond, the first issue of the bond using blockchain technology. A blockchain operated new debt instrument, bond-i has been issued by the World Bank in Australian dollars on a platform developed by Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Bond-i enables both issuance and trading on Ethereum blockchain.

**BOSS-101**

Based on XinFin Hybrid Blockchain, TradeFinex BOSS-101 will simplify and streamline the entire corporate bond lifecycle. TradeFinex BOSS-101 will create a global bond standard by connecting traditional bond market with digital bond technology. Built-in KYC/AML regulations and standard features like profile creation for both organization and individual; makes TradeFinex BOSS-101, a real-life bond creation, and exchange platform.

A blockchain-powered digital bond, TradeFinex BOSS-101 is fully secure and transparent and will always avoid the risk of a single point of failure for its users. Not only will it make creating, managing, and liquidating bond instruments seamlessly easy but will also enable hassle-free automatic, instant, and efficient bond settlements for its users. Another major benefit would be the enhancement of secondary market liquidity by bringing brokers, dealers, and licensed entities on one single platform.

Let’s learn about BOSS-101 in detail:

**a) Eliminates counterparty risks and delays**

Who doesn’t remember the financial crisis of 2008? It was only after the crisis of 2008, Bitcoin came into being. The reason is: People lost confidence in trusted financial institutions. Counterparty risk is notably the most significant risk when it comes to financial transactions, the very proof being the industry’s reliance on credit ratings.

Through bond issuance on XinFin blockchain, the counterparty risk pertaining to financial intermediaries that transacting parties usually rely on in a traditional set up is fully eliminated. Immutability of XinFin blockchain eliminates the need for reconciliations allowing independent parties to work with universal data sources automatically. For market participants, automation allows for any kind of stored data record to be represented on the blockchain, from ownership of assets to contractual obligations, credit exposures or static data and even the deployment of self-enforcing smart contracts, Dapps, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Smart contracts over XinFin blockchain ensure agreements are implements to agreed-upon business outcomes.

**b) Increased transaction efficiency**

Secondary market transaction of private securities is very time-consuming and can take weeks or even months to conclude. The settlement times are usually three working days (T+3) for listed securities, provided the transaction is matched and securities are delivered without any delays. However, this is not always the case as manual intervention from various parties can take several days to settle a single trade. On smart contracts-powered XinFin mainnet, the transactions are executed on a peer-to-peer basis without a centralized clearinghouse and trades are always matched; leading to instant bond settlements. Moreover, process automation enables liquidity enhancement and price discovery around the clock.

**c) Supports broker-dealer and licensed entities**

An entity that facilitates the issuance of digital asset securities and secondary trading in digital asset securities acts as a “broker” or “dealer” that is required to register with the Commission and become a member of the self-regulatory organization, for example, FINRA. TradeFinex BOSS-101 digital bond deals with all kinds of registered broker-dealer and licensed entities which makes it lawful for any broker or dealer to induce or attempt the purchase or sale, of a bond (or any security).

**d) Enhances secondary market liquidity**

The secondary bond market that directly influences the pricing benchmarks in the primary bond market has witnessed a significant decline in trading volumes in the last few years. Factors compelling this decline include increasingly stringent industry regulations and the manual intervention used in trading fixed-income securities-including origination and communication processes that have not changed significantly in the last 50 years.

Powered by blockchain technology, BOSS-101 transforms the entire primary bond market by bringing all stakeholders, namely, brokers, dealers, and licensed entities together on one single platform. The facilitation of digital bond issuance on a secure, efficient, and transparent XinFin mainnet network results in the efficient discovery of benchmark prices, ultimately leading to the enhancement of secondary market liquidity.

**e) Issued in any currency**

TradeFinex BOSS-101 is a digital bond that can be issued in any currency. Therefore, international financial institutions can buy, sell or trade digital bonds making BOSS-101 a global-level bond platform.

**Live (bond creation) PoC on TradeFinex Website**

Running on XinFin mainnet, TradeFinex BOSS-101 digital bond is live where users can create their own bond by putting in details like bond details, identifiers, credit debit rating, coupon details, bond token, etc. Users can see the full functionality of how a bond is created, how it goes onto the ledger and how a transaction hash is generated on the TradeFinex website. Explore more about digital Bonds [here](http://localhost/DemoTradeFinex/publicv/boss_101).

**Bond-i**

The World-Bank in partnership with Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has recently enabled secondary market bond trading on the blockchain with the bond-i solution following its creation last year. The digital bond, dubbed as a “Bondi” bond — stands for Blockchain Operated New Debt Instrument as well as holds a reference to Australia’s most famous beach, Bondi Beach.

The launch of bond-i formed part of World Bank’s broader strategic focus to harness the potential of disruptive technologies (i.e. blockchain) across all of its operations to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

Bond-i is perceived as an initial step in eliminating or minimizing manual intervention in bond sales and automating the entire process to make it fast and efficient.

Bond-i is a two-year bond that was arranged by CBA and raised somewhere around 110 million Australian dollars and the proceeds went towards sustainable development initiatives such as reducing poverty and promoting lasting development.

While the World Bank asserts bond-i to be the first “created, allocated, transferred, and managed through its life cycle using distributed ledger technology”, some companies have already issued bonds in different parts of the world.

As per the bond-i team, what sets them apart is that the entire bond process — from creation to allocation and management throughout its two-year cycle — takes place on the blockchain. Also, their scale is much larger than the private blockchain bond offerings.

The bond-i platform utilizes blockchain technology for issuance including launch, bookbuild, allocation and the management of bond holdings throughout the bond lifecycle. It features:

* Automated bond auction, bookbuild, and allocation
* Electronic bid capture
* Real-time updates and enhanced visibility according to participant’s permissions
* Auditable and immutable transaction record for probity and operational risk management
* A permissioned network of authorized participants

The completion of secondary transactions with trading activity recorded on a distributed ledger shows blockchain’s vast potential to enhance the coordination of securities trading and its management.

The nodes are deployed in Sydney and in Washington, and between these two nodes, smart contracts can be deployed in a way that actions can be automated between these two institutions without any manual intervention. Bond-i is an end-to-end program which can take financial institutions from the issuance of a bond right through to secondary market trading of that bond through a trusted shared ledger.

Bond-i secondary trading on the blockchain might be a giant step forward towards enabling capital markets to leverage distributed ledger technologies for faster, more efficient, and more secure transactions, the 51% attack possibility on ethereum blockchain can’t be overlooked. Moreover, bond-i is a digital bond that can be issued only in Australian dollars and not in all currencies. This means bond-i doesn’t have access to international financial institutions limiting it to specific regions and users who can buy, sell, and trade bonds.

**Conclusion:**

As mentioned earlier, bond-i will deploy a private ethereum blockchain for the creation and management of bonds. While ethereum blockchain might have been asserted as solid in terms of architecture, security, and functionality by Microsoft, financial institutions can’t ignore ethereum’s biggest failure — 51% DAO hack. Running on the proof-of-work mechanism, ethereum blockchain is exposed to 51% attack vector. This happens when a specific group acquires more computing power than the rest of the network combined. It can both reverse past transactions and prevent new ones from being signed on the blockchain. Undoubtedly, some biggest fundamental changes need to be made to ethereum blockchain — like changing proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake protocol to make it more secure. All these things explain why institutional investors and financial institutions are still reluctant to fully trust the reliability of the ethereum blockchain.

On the other hand, BOSS-101 is powered by open source enterprise-ready XinFin hybrid blockchain for global trade and finance. Combining the power and transparency of public network and security and speed of the private network and interoperable smart contracts, TradeFinex BOSS-101 digital bond can be listed in multiple secondary markets for great access to liquidity. For the bond instrument, XinFin uses the ISO20022 standard security message as a reference data and hash it on the bond details — something that makes it a secure and reliable option to bank upon for financial institutions.

88,2019-07-26,ncaa76,1,Bitcoin - Binary Options Scam - Proflex Options (Buyer Beware),"This is  an elaborate investment scam and you want to be very careful when it comes to trusting people you meet online.  I was recently matched with a binary investor manager (scammer), while using a popular app for networking called, Shapr.  I met a nice person named Peter McGuffey (ended up being a fake person), I mentioned I was interested in binary options and he recommended I sign up for a site called, [proflexoptions.com](https://proflexoptions.com) site looked legit and had great reviews and you can see they put a lot of work to making the site appear reputable. I did attempt to do some research on the site via google, but I ignored the red flag that there was no established history of the site on search engines. I was willing to over look a lot of things because you have Peter who is in on the scam reassuring me with lie after lie that is legit and I have an opportunity to make good money.  I've found a lot of the so called investment mangers lurking on this social media sites looking for unsuspecting people like myself to scam.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically the scam works like this, the scammer will seem very friendly and knowledgeable of binary options and if you invest as little as $350-$500 to start at the basic level you can typically see returns of 4k to 10k or more in as 7-10 days.  The Scammer will only ask for 15% or 30% of your earnings when you cash out.  So all you have to do is setup a free account with [proflexoptions.com](https://proflexoptions.com) or a similar and make your initial deposit of $500 to fund your account.  This allows the scammer to bid on high yields to maximize your investment.  Keep in mind, I wanted to setup a call with the Peter first before making any type of deposit and he agreed which gave me reassurance that this was legit.  When I spoke with Peter it was suspicious and I once again ignored the red flag that he sounded nothing like the guy in the picture.  He had a slight accent possibly African decent, but was very charismatic and his english was not broken.  After being convinced this guy was on the up and up  I decided to move forward.  Peter also reassured me this is completely legit (100%). 

&amp;#x200B;

After making my initial deposit of $500 in bitcoin I was ready to allow Peter to start bidding for me. In a few days I was up $2700 with the weekend coming up and I was super excited.  This is when scam started to unfold, I was told before hand that my account had to be vetted for 7 days before I can withdraw any funds.  So even though I was up my initial investment I had to wait to cash out.  By the time I was ready to withdraw, Peter had earned close to $7,000 and apparently this exceeded the amount you can withdraw at Basic level I started with a $500 investment.  So in order to now to withdrawal any funds I would need to upgrade to the Silver tier and this would require an additional $1500.  I immediately went off on Peter and let him know I thought this was a scam and I didn't have the money (which I didn't) to upgrade.  I asked him to front the money and I would pay him back once I cashed out, I figured this would really see if this dude was willing to put some skin in the game too since he was again reassuring this was 100% legit and did not think I would exceed my winnings at the basic level.  Well he didn't front the whole $1500, but was willing to cover 40% and I had to come up with the 60%.  Keep in mind he is still bidding and now my total is now up to $12,000 ready to withdraw and I would get a $4000 bonus once I upgrade to silver.  Of course, I was already $500 in and looking at $16,000 to cash out in 5 days or less I decided to borrow the funds from a family member and upgrade to silver.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was continuously reassured from Peter that I would be cashing out and I had nothing to worry about and he looked forward to all the referrals I would be sending him.  So I did pay the borrowed $900 and immediately after Peter paid his $600 I was now ready to start the withdrawal; or so I thought.  As I goto the withdrawal page I noticed there is not an option to push Next or Done?  Since the site has a live chat I immediately got the chat to find out what gives? After going back and forth with the person I'm told I need to pay the taxes on my earnings and not that my earnings are up to $20,000, my taxes would be $611.  Well of course I said take out the taxes from the withdrawal, but conveniently I would have to pay them up front, because they can not remove from the earnings and in the past when they gave earnings to others, 90% of the people would cash out and never take pay their taxes.  So in order for me to withdraw I would need to pay the $611. Now I beyond pissed, I'm cussing out Peter and whoever I chatting with on the site.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm realizing this more than likely a scam and I'm going to have to cut my losses, however I got more reassurance from Peter and thinking I could be walking away from $20,000 withdrawal I decided I would pay the $611, this was a huge risk and would put my checking account at negative.  After having confirmation that the bitcoin was deposited into the designated bitcoin address ( which I double checked) I got on the chat to confirm they received the paid taxes and of course they said they did not see the deposit yet.  After many days going back and forth if they got it or not (the transaction to place on a Saturday), I was told they would need to investigate to see what happened.  I had all the proof on my end the funded were completed, but after an additional 48hr investigation they cam e to the conclusion I was a victim of a man in the middle hack (does not exist).  Reality has now officially set in and I'm ready to start looking up IP addresses and visiting people, Ive also lost all trust in Peter and I'm not holding back.  He tries to reassure but its not working anymore and he realizes it. He tells me he is also ready to stop investing with the company also and if I could just wait a day before I post on social media this is a scam because he has another client who is ready to withdrawal too and to see if he can.  I did, and he tried to show me proof that it worked, but I didn't care about the pending funds and I want to see the hash from blockchain and a complete transaction when the funds are in his account.  Given they realized I was on to this scam, the next day my account was deleted from [proflexoptions.com](https://proflexoptions.com) site and Peters whatsapp account was deleted.  I was officially scammed.  :(

&amp;#x200B;

Please pass this on to anyone who has gone through this or dealing with this company or one similar to proflexoptions.com , they are all scams and I hope this helps someone avoid falling into the same scam I had to go through.

**Foreword**

It's clear that cryptocurrencies are gradually making inroads into the global economy, moving closer to mass adoption. Cryptocurrencies offer a number of advantages - decentralization and trust, lower commissions and disintermediation - that make it easier for users to carry out their daily transactions. Anybody can transfer value around the globe, winning from fast processing time.

In comparison, sending value across borders via legacy financial systems requires lengthy waiting periods and fees, while also making users stuck into highly complex processes. For instance, if a person from Japan wants to send some money to England, the fees can range anywhere from 5% up to 10%, depending on the system being used. In addition, there will be some currency conversion fees. It seems that centralized players, currently enjoying lack of competition, set up fees and commissions just as they wish.

And it's merchants that carry out cross-border transactions that find working with legacy finance institutions most troublesome. They keep losing hefty chunks from their potential profits, just paying out fees to payment processors. This makes businesses hike up their prices, passing these expenses to ordinary consumers. Crypto offers a paradigm shift change, bringing to the table lightning speeds and lower fees. Although cryptocurrencies have been winning more and more attention from merchants worldwide, there's still a number of roadblocks to wider adoption, among which are price volatility, scalability limitations and others.

Volatility is admittedly the biggest hurdle that prevents businesses from using cryptocurrencies more. Bitcoin can experience huge fluctuations in just a matter of hours or even minutes. In addition, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum present scalability issues, which results in high processing time. A merchant, who has to handle hundreds of payments on a daily basis, would not be able to conduct their business efficiently if transactions get stuck for days on end. On top of that, it's extremely hard for adopters to convert cryptocurrencies into fiat via the banks and other financial agents they usually work with. 

Cryptocurrencies seek to offer solutions to all of these issues. 

**What is stablecoin?** 

A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency, whose architecture enables its price to always equal the price of another asset. Most of the stablecoins are pegged to USD. The biggest names in cryptocurrencies are Tether, Gemini Dollar, USDQ, TUSD and others. 

**How do stablecoins manage to be so stable?**

As opposed to other coins that float freely, stable cryptocurrencies require that each unit is backed with a unit of the fiat currency. For instance, Tether (USDT) pegs 1 USDT to 1 USD on the one-to-one basis. In this way, stablecoins are somewhere between cryptocurrencies and regular fiats. Tether is based on its own blockchain that is built on top of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum systems.

Although Tether is the biggest stablecoin, there's a number of concerns as to its operations. The biggest one is the continuing controversy as to the fiat reserves, which the issuer is supposed to store on the one-to-one ratio to the number of issued Tether units. The company has been saying that the audit will be done in the near future, but just several weeks ago it started to claim that it's not only the cash, but also loans to other companies that can be recorded as fiat reserves. These statements resulted in growing distrust among crypto enthusiasts.

Another project is TrueUSD (TUSD). It also pegs to USD. The difference with Tether is the openness to audits and transparency. The company is open to third-party audits, it publishes the duly verified reports on the fiat reserves it holds. In addition, users enjoy legal protections.

USDC is another stablecoin that was created by the famous cryptocurrency exchange Circle. Just as TUSD, if offers regulatory compliance and transparency. The big problem about all these systems is the fact that they enable authorities to seize users’ funds, which completely negates the very idea of decentralization and anti-censorship, on which crypto is built.

USDQ is different from other stablecoins as it's not backed by the fiat currency, but by Bitcoin and other  top-10 cryptocurrencies in the future. This enables the ecosystem to avoid dealing with legacy financial systems. Through the overcollateralization process, USDQ turns highly volatile cryptocurrencies into the USD-pegged USDQ that is perfect for storing value and processing transactions in the external economy without any risk of price changes. The coin is being developed by PLATINUM ENGINEERING with the small community slowly growing around the project. 

**Why do we need stablecoins?**

Stablecoins have advanced as a new iteration on cryptocurrencies, enabling to address such issues as high volatility and interactions with legacy financial systems. 

Coins like USDQ make sure that various mechanisms are used in order to stabilize the prices at the USD peg. Traders can easily change their Bitcoins into USDQ and thus prevent the negative impact on unwanted prices changes. Stablecoins are very easy to use, which is a boon for non-techy adopters. Any person from around the world can quickly convert fiats into stablecoins, without any need to think about future price changes and without worrying about potential risks for losing their funds. As a rule, you'll always find various stablecoins on crypto exchanges, enabling traders to quickly move around stables and other cryptos. 

As we've spoken above, cross-border payments win most from using the stablecoins. This hybrid species between fiat and crypto will help open up the hidden value in global trade, amounting to trillions of dollars in profits for stakeholders.

96,2019-07-13,bolyus21,1,Mapping Out Some Collateral Developments to Blockchain Technology,"Guest Blogger: *Andrew Rossow, Esq.*

Every once and while, a new technology comes around that positively impacts innovation in several fields, even some outside of its initially intended sector. Blockchains, more specifically Bitcoin, is increasingly showing the signs of doing the very same.

From the expansion and further development of [zero-knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) (ZKPs) to [sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQ#can-snarks-and-starks-help), a seemingly golden age of cryptography, improved privacy, and permissionless financial products have branched out from Bitcoin’s meteoric rise.

ZKPs and a New Era of Privacy

Obviously central to the name “cryptocurrencies,” is the cryptography component that underpins Bitcoin’s transaction scheme and that of the many altcoins. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, which is becoming increasingly clear with the likes of blockchain forensics companies emerging left and right — attracting government support in the process.

However, that realization has led to some fascinating downstream effects in the development of better cryptography.

For example, research into a full-scale implementation of Schnorr Signatures, widely considered to be the best cryptographic signature primitive, [recently materialized](https://www.coindesk.com/blockstream-releases-test-code-for-bitcoin-tech-upgrade-schnorr) into a formal proposal for inclusion into Bitcoin. Dubbed, “MuSig,” Schnorr Signatures would confer better scalability and privacy to the legacy cryptocurrency.

But the innovation does not stop there.

Out of the demand for anonymity came altcoins like Monero and ZCash, predicated on novel cryptographic techniques for completely masking the identities of users and the amounts transferred.

For example, Monero, a “CryptoNote Coin,” leverages the power of ring signatures — a technique for obfuscating the originator of a signed digital message that has been around for years but never applied on the scale as it is with Monero.

Researchers even released a new implementation of formalized ring signatures for enhanced privacy, called [OmniRing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/buumwj/omniring_scaling_up_private_payments_without/), designed to scale up privacy transactions without the feared “trusted setup.” Similarly, the production of “[Bulletproofs](https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/)” out of the famed Stanford Applied Cryptography Group enhanced the efficiency of privacy-preserving transactions, which have historically been data-heavy.

The concept builds on the notion of ZKPs, which have attracted the nickname of “crypto magic” for being unfathomably complex from a mathematical perspective while furnishing near-complete anonymity.

All of these developments, while built on technologies preceding Bitcoin, have accelerated over the last few years. Even banks, like JP Morgan, are joining in on the fun, building their own implementations of ZKPs for private transactions.

The snowballing innovation in the field of cryptography comes at an opportune time. Once hailed by cypherpunks as the [last vestige of hope](https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/) against a surveillance state, cryptography is a powerful shield against the repeated data malpractice of tech firms and government snooping.

What began as an era of openly sharing on social media platforms, has spun into a complicated mix of wanting social media but without corporations and governments having access to the data — privacy is now at a premium.

Distributed Computing — Scaling Decentralized Networks

Similar to the rise in cryptography over the last several years, there has been an explosion in distributed computing, particularly scaling decentralized networks. Emerging out of the need for public, permissionless blockchain networks (i.e., Ethereum) to scale better, a confluence of efficiency improvements and innovative technologies are seeking to power public blockchains with the same performance level as their centralized counterparts.

For example, the concept of *sharding* — horizontally partitioning a database — has gained prominence among several platforms, including Ethereum, as a way to enable groups (i.e., shards) of nodes process transactions in parallel. Ethereum’s foray into sharding is known as its Serenity upgrade, which is pending rollout following more extensive research and testing of the underlying concept.

Other projects, like [Elrond](https://elrond.com/), are pushing the envelope even farther. Elrond is working on a bleeding-edge form of state sharding known as “Adaptive State Sharding” in conjunction with their secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Compared to the other forms of sharding, transaction and network, state sharding is the most technically complex and widely considered to have enormous potential in boosting the performance of public blockchains. Elrond implements all three in an ambitious take on scaling decentralized networks.

Take the case of Elrond, whose [Testnet](https://testnet.elrond.com/#/) is already live, and has reached a peak performance capacity of nearly 12,000 transactions per second (TPS). For context, Ethereum’s current iteration process roughly 15 – 20 TPS.

Sharding, similar to the aforementioned privacy technologies, is not a new concept either. Sharding is prevalent for improving database efficiency and has been around for many years. It is only recently that it began garnering attention in crypto circles as a method to improve the scalability of decentralized networks.

The sheer scale of development of sharding applied to distributed networks is nothing short of impressive so far.

The convergence of technologies like sharding with new consensus designs, like PoS, is sure to usher in a new generation of blockchains, supplemented by better privacy and scalability. It is not surprising that such developments have flown under the radar, as they are highly esoteric, but their downstream advantages for mainstream consumers and app users are promising.

Bitcoin may have birthed a spectacular invention of money, but its collateral effects in the form of distributed computing and cryptography may come to have a more dynamic impact on society than a P2P digital currency.

99,2019-07-11,XCOEX,1,A simplified cryptocurrency exchange,"The appreciation in the number of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges is intended to bring about transparency and decentralization in the market.

According to Alex Altgauzen, COO of cryptocurrency exchange XCOEX:

*“The importance of decentralizing this market is massive. The market is still in its infancy. A small number of exchanges controlling the market could eventually result in a centralized catastrophe that we were all trying to avoid in the first place.”*

[**XCOEX**](https://xcoex.com/) is currently running a daily contest till June 30, in an effort to attract new investors.

Altgauzen points out that the rise of such smaller exchanges is a boon to the community as a whole:

*“Spreading investors among many exchange platforms is crucial at this point. We all remember the MtGox hack and the resulting negative effects throughout the industry.”*

Opportunities for small exchanges to emerge, grow and thrive are abundant. This is due to the growing lack of trust in larger “centralized” cryptocurrency exchanges. Investors are likely to notice and leverage small exchanges for investing in digital assets. Additionally, it is now easier to launch an exchange.

For example, another new blockchain business, Spotware, offers out of the box exchange platforms for anyone looking to launch an exchange. By reducing some of the startup costs exchanges typically face, Spotware too is opening doors to decentralization.

What happened in the market to create this deep need for smaller exchanges, DEX, and other, less powerful alternatives?

The explosive growth of Binance and other large crypto exchanges. They were launched only with the sole purpose of creating a market monopoly for themselves.

We cannot go back in time and take part in one of the first ICO’s (Ethereum) with an ATH return of 460 633% or one of the first IEO’s (BitTorrent) with a 1 683% ATH return. Opportunities like those are extremely rare, happen quickly, and we usually learn about them only after the fact. Perhaps this, the first STEO from Dreamr, is also this kind of an opportunity; one that should not be missed. 

ICOs were far from perfect and became one of the main causes of Crypto Winter; the market reacted with the evolution into STO and IEO formats, and Crypto Spring began.

103,2019-08-27,8BTCblockchainNEWS,0,What has Changed for Altcoins Since 2017 ?,"  

[Talks of Bitcoin’s rising dominance](https://news.8btc.com/opinion-what-has-changed-for-altcoins-since-2017) to a point of triggering a general altcoins bull season are becoming more frequent. The dominance level has already surpassed the 65% range which got altcoins running the last time to, particularly with the influence of ICOs, swell the total crypto market by hundreds of billion dollars.

An alts season will stem Bitcoin’s dominance level which will delay mass adoption if it persists – altcoins, not Bitcoin, matter for mass adoption to create a stable market. Also, an altcoins season will need real adoption – not seem to be near going by market outlook – to trigger value increase. However, as the market is seemingly focused on Bitcoin and its pending block reward halving which will impact overall, a lot has changed in the technology realm of altcoins since 2017 to guarantee another bull run would play out soon or repeat exactly like it happened then.

Ethereum vs. other blockchains duet coming 

The heavy reliance on the Ethereum network played a big role in the past as majority of ICOs were held on the platform. That is no longer the case. Unlike 2017, the number of ICOs being conducted generally has dropped drastically forcing a sell pressure on its native asset, ether, to push its value down.

Though Ethereum still has the most developers, partnerships, network after Bitcoin etc, its top position has since been challenged by other blockchains especially from Asia and series of IEOs held on exchanges like Bittrex and Binance.

Vitalik Buterin also recently cited scalability as a big bottleneck as the Ethereum blockchain is almost full. A bet on whether Ethereum will be able to solve its scalability issues in the long term will either leave most of other blockchains with less to do or see projects migrate over to other blockchains probably for their higher tps or lesser transaction fees.

Token economics matter 

The token economics of any serious crypto/blockchain project should have helped worked out a clear model for their token’s utility – market use for a purpose that creates demand – by now. The next five years should enable such projects to capture their set markets, generate revenue and be assessed based on their performance. Unlike the last two years when all most projects had were ideas on whitepapers, now they have a community to build, a product to develop and a real purpose to pursue.

Projects with good utility models will always have less risks for investors especially if their usage keeps increasing with time to guarantee sustainable value. This is crucial as investors in the space are smarter than in 2017 with no new money flooding the market . Also, all eyes are on existing projects that have not been appropriately tested in the space during the last spike as they stand a better chance of success in the long term over those that only thrived on speculations.

Altcoins diversification now gets a rethink

Since the end of 2017, most altcoins have lost about 90% of their value. By 2018, the market supposedly started purging itself of projects without solid real world usage. A year and a half on, the altcoins bear market continues with most of them struggling including some that are considered to be good projects. The prolonged bearish state has enabled many investors to accumulate as they pick and stay with whatever new project they want.

It offers a section of the crypto market the opportunity to channel more of their investment on a few key low cap projects for cheap and on a fail-big or win-big basis. This investment strategy is to help gain higher returns – if it wins – [while diversification is to preserve gained wealth later](https://news.8btc.com/opinion-what-has-changed-for-altcoins-since-2017)."

106,2019-08-21,ZaadNek,0,Invest in the next big thing after bitcoin (if any),"So, what are your bets?

Personally I think bitcoin will survive, because the big money likes it. Bitcoin has the name and proven to be secure for 10 years now. But I don't believe in all those other public blockchain projects. They shout a lot, but even in this early stage of adoption they already suffer from performing. And be honest, which other project do you use yourself? Blockchain is not user friendly at all. And all those tricks to make it perform, makes it less decentralised which is the whole point of bitcoin.

So if I have to pick a project that can be the next big thing. I would pick a project with no blockchain at all! But something different, still unique, technical superior and it must have a lot of potential to beat the current king.

From all the non-blockchain projects I know of, I think the SAFE Network(MAID) is the best candidate.  [https://medium.com/safenetwork](https://medium.com/safenetwork)  It's a complete decentralised anonymous data/communications network(unique!) which has its own consensus mechanism called PARSEC(technical superior!). This one is much faster than blockchain and scales very well by design. On top of this network you can build anything you can do on the current internet(lot of potential!). It is easy to use because you can use webbrowsers/apps on PC or phone to access the network, just you are used to right now. 

It will have its own cryptocurrency(private and realtime transactions) which is kinda backed by the data and services on the network. Which makes it valuable as well.

An unique project, but very big and ambitious. Still in development. So there is risk, but risk means high rewards.

What do you think? Any other candidates?"

108,2019-08-16,inEthos,0,Have any of you heard of DeFi?,"If you have not DeFi is a movement that is happening on the Ethereum blockchain. I know a lot of people in traditional finance are not so keen on blockchain technology due to its volatility and a few other things.  
DeFi is a huge innovation and I wanted to get your opinion on it. At its core DeFi allows you to back safe overcollateralized loans. This ultimately means around a 8-12% rate of return on your USD.

The loans you back are crypto loans. So for example, I have $200 in bitcoin and need to access the value in my portfolio but want a right to buy it back. I would in turn get a loan of around $100 and need to pay it back with interest.

In a nutshell, there is a good opportunity provided by these companies called lending protocols for people to get a good return on their USD. There is a company called outlet.finance that allows anyone to hook their bank account up to these new systems and start earning 12% interest instead of the banking standard 0.09%

If you have any questions about DeFi I can answer them. These are some of the popular protocols that allow you to earn this kind of return on USD. Compound.finance, dharma, dy/dx."

114,2019-09-20,PinchPod,0,Stock Exchange problems,"Hi everyone!  So, here's what i figured out!

Before when you start trading on the stock markets, buy stocks and securities of large corporations or speculate on the difference in exchange rates - you should always open an account with a broker. You must register a personal account, create a password, provide documents. And all of this should be done in order to ensure that all securities purchased by trader store in the Depository, recorded by your name. It is how the financial system works for a long time, created for safe trading for market participants. But I don’t need to strain my memory to remember a lot of problems that may arise. For my long life I saw bankruptcy, revocation of a licence and others.

   Blockchain is the system that comes to mind when it is necessary to modernize the work of brokers. What do you think? I do not like to keep my money with a broker, especially since I hold shares for a significant amount. And, therefore, I would prefer buy and sell via smart contracts. What curious cases could you remember because of brokers stupidity? How to improve the financial system?"
115,2019-09-16,Mobilenewsflash,0,Invest in Small Coins: Best Unknown Cryptocurrency 2019,"Bitcoin made numerous early investors millionaires, rich beyond their wildest dreams and their lives changed forever. After Bitcoin, others saw similar riches investing in coins like Ripple, Nano, and Ethereum.

Of course, it’s now too late to invest in Bitcoin, Ripple, Nano, or Ethereum and see the same gains that the first investors got. “Gem hunters”, people who look for the next massive gains, are looking for little known coins with potential to net 100-1000x gains.

Finding the Best Crypto Coin to Invest In

In searching for the best possible investment with the potential for the greatest gains, there are several pertinent criteria that must be met. The perfect choice is a unique coin that looks to provide a utility not yet achieved by Bitcoin or other altcoins.

Some of the qualities of the perfect moonshot are as follows:

Cheap Price Point

Small Market Cap

No ICO

Dedicated Team

Strong Community

Most importantly: Legitimate Service and Real Utility

With that, our choice as the next moonshot is…

Best Small Cap Coin for 2019: Nyzo

Nyzo is very new, having just launched in December 2018. The coin is not yet listed on CoinMarketCap, which means it has flown under everyone’s radar until now.

The purpose of this crypto coin is to create a mesh network. This is a unique utility not possible through Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other coins.

A mesh network is a type of internet framework in which participants share resources with one another. This enables them to build bandwidth through one another, versus relying on a centralized Internet Service provider (ISP).

There is huge demand for mesh network infrastructure in areas where service providers are dangerous or predatory. Recently, a meshnet by protestors In Hong Kong, has risen as go-to medium for messaging as it cannot be shut down by Chinese government forces.

Nyzo operates through its novel “Proof-of-Diversity” mechanism. In essence, each participant in Nyzo further bolsters the mesh network. They are rewarded for their participation as they contribute to the greater diversity of the network. The better diversity, the stronger the network.

Nyzo is the only blockchain coin in the world that operates under this system.

Trading Nyzo

Each Nyzo coin trades for roughly $0.20. With a --at the time of writing-- circulating supply of 7,950,000, the market cap is only 1.9 million. Keep in mind that coins like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple are worth tens of billions of dollars.

Nyzo was launched fairly, there was no ICO and the founders do not control a portion of the supply. This indicates that there are no major entities that are looking for a quick return on investment.

Right now, there is a passionate community silently building out and accumulating Nyzo. In its current phase, the coin looks similar to RaiBlocks crypto coin when it was only trading for fractions of a penny. Months later, it traded for over $35.

Nyzo holders are anticipating gains in the tune of thousands of times return on investment. While the cryptocurrency is still a hidden gem, it’s the perfect time to buy in.

If you bought $100 worth of Nyzo today, and it grew to become a top 20 coin, you would then have somewhere around $100,000.

Where to Buy Nyzo

The best exchange to buy Nyzo is QTrade. This is the perfect exchange because they are regulated in the United States but do not require users to verify their identity.

The exchange features little known, innovative coins, which makes it a perfect fit for trading Nyzo.

Keeping your Coins Safe

Once you’ve purchased your Nyzo, it’s imperative to take the proper measures to ensure they are safe from hackers. Keep the following safety precautions in mind:

Use a different password between your trading accounts and emails.

Always enable two-factor authentication.

Secure your coins in your own wallet, not on a website.

Don’t tell others about the amount of coins you own.

Be patient!

Once you’ve secured your Nyzo investment, it’s only a matter of time before you’ll start to see appreciation of your crypto coin."

This includes work that has been completed and merely awaits description and publication and open questions for improving the current protocols.  
&gt;  
&gt;Decentralized Pension System To demonstrate that the blockchain can solve problems globally, Asure also developed a prototype of a global pension system that is fully decentralized and therefore not in the hands of government or insurance companies. This is an alpha phase experiment designed to show how the social security system can be improved in the future with the help of blockchain technology. The idea is to implement a pay-as-you-go pension system on the Ethereum blockchain. Members pay their contribution in ETH and receive ERC20 tokens in return. There are no contributions invested in the capital market and

therefore no interest is earned. Instead, the paid ETH is used directly for the payment of unpaid pension claims. How much pension funds must be paid depends on how many pension tokens a retiree has, that is how much contribution he pays into the system. [https://www.asure.network](https://www.asure.network/)"

127,2019-09-10,Mindreactions,5,Blockchain Projects to Watch in 2019,"# These blockchain projects may stay out of your radars since not all of them were actively advertised. However, we can say with confidence that these projects are worth paying attention to in 2019.

It is always necessary to keep abreast of trends that occur in the cryptocurrency world. Many crypto advocates and traders called the year 2018 “crypto winter” after prices fell from their historic highs to critical lows. But with the onset of spring 2019, everything has changed.

The bull market has returned and [Bitcoin](https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/), the father of all cryptocurrencies, has undoubtedly started this race. Now it is the end of August and many crypto enthusiasts foreshadow the recurrence of the events of autumn 2017.

Top 5 coins that will be considered below may stay out of your radars since not all of these digital assets were previously known and actively advertised. But we can say with confidence that these projects have the technology and they are worth paying attention to by the end of 2019.

Several criteria were used for the following compilation among which are:

* Technology. Foundations of technology development. In particular, a number of disruptive technologies they offer.
* Business. Large partnerships with industry giants, which will further facilitate blockchain adoption across the world.
* Community. Community activity in terms of cumulative total audience across social media.
* Media coverage. Exciting and ambitious PR activities that a company has organized for the course of a year.
* Price Charts. The token price: it shouldn’t be overrated or highly underrated (volume/market cap ratio variable), and there is potential for growth.

## Chainlink

Undoubtedly, we can distinguish [Chainlink](https://chain.link/). The project there was a lot of talks about throughout the summer of 2019. Starting in January 2019, the price of this coin increased by more than 10 times and brought huge profits to investors who invested in the project in the early stages of investment.

This project is traded on all major exchanges and has good volumes near $ 80 million. Chainlink is an input and output service that provides a reliable connection to external data that is provably secure end-to-end. This technology is very popular in the market since input and output services serve as data channels for smart contracts. There were many events related to Chainlink, which contributed to the rapid growth of the coin. Key events were the partnership with Google and listing on Coinbase Pro.

## Quant

The second project worth paying attention to is [Quant](https://www.quant.network/). Like the previous one, Quant has had good growth rates since the beginning of 2019. It was named “Cool Vendor in Blockchain Technology” by Gartner. Quant Network is a pioneering technology company combining cybersecurity, industry and government experience to develop advanced technologies enabling trusted interactions between companies and their customers. Quant Network is recognized for having solved interoperability through the creation of blockchain operating system.

This project has a partnership with SIA, the European leader in the design, creation, and management of technology infrastructures and services for Financial Institutions, Central Banks, Corporates and the Public Sector, in the areas of payments, cards, network services, and capital markets.

SIA Group provides its services in 50 countries and manages over 50 billion financial transactions per year. This partnership will help the company’s development and bring the widespread introduction of Quant technology.

## Credits

The next project that you should pay attention to in 2019 is [Credits](https://credits.com/), in the last 10 days, this project has risen by more than 200 positions and is currently at 150 position on CMC. This project has great potential. During 2019 it entered into partnerships with more than 30 companies – system integrators, who will present their solutions based on Credits blockchain technology to their end customers.

With many small and medium-sized partners around the world, Credits also works with industry giants such as IBM and Lenovo. During 2019, the company has been actively engaged in completing the development of its own blockchain platform and has released the first dapps and services based on it.

Credits plans to make a token swap by the end of 2019. Among the news, that contributed to such rapid growth, we can distinguish the token swap coming and recently announced AMA session with such well-known projects like Matic Network, QuarkChain, and Holochain.

## Cosmos

[Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/), sponsored by the Interchain Foundation (ICF), was founded to “facilitate the next generation of Blockchain technology” and to create an Internet of blockchains. Cosmos unites all types of blockchains, taking advantage of Tendermint and Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol (IBC). Projects linked or embedded in the Cosmos Network can exchange tokens directly.

Cosmos is a network for better compatibility between all types of blockchains. The idea of ​​creating the project came to developers back in 2017. In April 2017, developers managed to raise $ 17 million in less than 30 minutes. The initial value of the token on the ICO was $ 0.1. The maximum cost of 1 ATOM reached $ 8. Even though the project was launched in 2017, token listings on cryptocurrency exchanges happened recently, namely in March 2019.

## Matic Network

Let’s not lose sight of the Matic cryptocurrency, released by the [Matic Network](https://matic.network/) project, which enlisted the support of [Coinbase](https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/) and implemented exchange placement on the Binance Launchpad. The cryptocurrency jumped by 75% per day and burst into the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of the daily trading volume.

The little-known Matic token managed to overcome the bearish mood that took place on the cryptocurrency market in early 2019 when Bitcoin could not hold above $ 8,000 and jumped in price by more than one and a half times, which allowed it to enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by capitalization.

Matic also has received funding from Coinbase Ventures, an American crypto holding. The partnership will allow Matic to integrate another cryptocurrency supported by Coinbase – [USD Coin](https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/usd-coin/) – into its side chains. On the other hand, Coinbase wallet users will be able to use the Matic network to transfer and trade digital assets. The Matic Network is a set of tools for scaling with extra-chain and side chains for existing blockchains such as Ethereum, to improve the level of user interaction through dApps.

# Conclusion

We can say for sure that it does not matter if 2019 repeats the events of 2017. All of the above-mentioned projects have a solid technical foundation for implementing their technology, which will create the demand for tokens and increase their utility in the long-term. Cross-chain operations, decentralized Oracle, interoperability solutions, fast transactions, and exceptional scalability would foster the whole blockchain industry as they would be leveraged by multinational corporations.

The five projects managed to get published on pages of leading crypto outlets and get significant social media coverage since 2019.

Besides, they hit Top-150 (according to [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)) and showed an outstanding performance in terms of ROI and/or later price gains. Anyway, one shouldn’t forget about the risk/return ratio before investing in any crypto"
128,2019-09-08,FreakingOblin007,2,Asure Network - First scalable decentralized social security network," **Project Introduction**

Asure Network is a layer 2 scaling network that enables fast, easy and secure transactions for not only payment transactions, but also generalized smart contract. Founded by German insurance and technology experts, the network enables everyone to quickly build, operate, and use highly scalable business applications through innovations in multi-chain scaling techniques and incentive-aligned crypto economics mechanism designs.

**What Problems Does Asure Network Solve?**

We are developing Asure Network as an infrastructure for social security systems of the future.

Our goal is to provide access to 4.1 billion people worldwide who have no access to social security systems today.

The existing social security systems are based on centralized databases, intransparent processes, fraud, corruption,

labor-intensive processes and lack of trust in systems are the challenges we solve with the help of blockchain and thus

we create a global inclusion in the social security market, just as Bitcoin allows for inclusion in the financial market.

Asure Network is a public blockchain that enables you to run complex business applications such as social insurance systems. By using a multi-chain architecture, individual applications are distributed and scaled using sub-chains, resulting in high transaction throughput.

The integrity, traceability, and transparency of the blockchain technology can create a high level of confidence in the accuracy and fairness of the implemented business processes. This is in direct conflict with the protection of user-related data and privacy standards such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Integrating zero-knowledge-proofs and decentralized identities give Asure Network the ability to resolve this conflict.

In the future, there will be many specialized blockchains for various applications. Asure Network uses bridging technologies to connect to other blockchains and allows the use of business processes across block boundaries. Ethereum is the first blockchain to be connected to the Asure Network.

130,2019-09-04,HugeMorr,1,How To Choose The Right ICO To Invest In,"""Initial Coin Offering or ICO is the cryptocurrency’s world public crowdsale. Whenever a project wants to launch a new coin or dApp, they can conduct an ICO to attract investors into their ecosystem. The most alluring part of ICOs is the lack of red tape and formality. More often than not, a company simply has to submit a whitepaper containing the technology and vision of the project to qualify for an ICO. Companies have been able to raise millions of dollars in mere seconds thanks to ICOs. It's a new phenomenon but one that has quickly become a dominant topic of discussion within the blockchain community. Many view ICO projects as unregulated securities that allow founders to raise an unjustified amount of capital, while others argue it is an innovation in the traditional venture-funding model. ICOs are simple to structure because of technologies like the ERC20 Token Standard, which reduces a lot of the development process necessary to create a new cryptographic asset. Most ICOs work by having investors send funds to a smart contract that stores the funds and distributes an equivalent value in the new token at a later point in time.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a ton of ICOs out there, with every single one of them promising huge returns and useful perks for potential investors. But, before doing so, it's a must to choose the right and safe ICO investment, because some projects might fail or worst it can be just a threat to someone's assets. The things to consider on choosing the right ICO project are as follows: Knowing the team, there are several major players within the crypto sphere, superstars that if shown in a whitepaper are a good sign for legitimacy and to investigate for more information about each team member is a good way to know the credibility of the team. Examining a crypto whitepaper, the white paper is a document that is used to promote and spark interest in a project. It should also have complementary materials like financial models, SWOT analysis, and detailed information on any associated legal concerns as well as a time table for all developments and implementation of the token, this can also help on finding future plans of the project. More of this has been thoroughly discussed in this [article](https://blog.kucoin.com/how-to-identify-a-scam-in-crypto-sk-rd). Nevertheless, it’s important to mention that, in some cases, the risk pays off. It's a must to know how to propely select an ICO project so that the chances of failing or being a victim of these attackers will be reduced."""

137,2019-10-12,beck2047,25,"Five companies, led by Mastercard, Visa and eBay, pulled out of Facebook’s planned digital currency Libra","https://www.ft.com/content/a3e952dc-ec5c-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061

Five companies, led by Mastercard, Visa and eBay, pulled out of Facebook’s planned digital currency Libra on Friday, following sustained political pressure and just days before the project’s backers are due to meet for their first board meeting.

The exit of Visa, Mastercard, eBay, Stripe and Mercado Pago came as a major blow to Facebook’s ambitions to shake up the global payments market and follows one week after PayPal announced it was also pulling out of the project.

The withdrawals follow intense scrutiny from international regulators and politicians, some of which have called for the project to be halted altogether, citing money laundering concerns and worries about wider financial stability.

“We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association’s ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations,” a Visa company spokesperson said on Friday.

“Visa’s continued interest in Libra stems from our belief that well-regulated blockchain-based networks could extend the value of secure digital payments to a greater number of people and places, particularly in emerging and developing markets,” the spokesperson added.

An eBay spokesperson said in a statement to the Financial Times that it had made the decision in order to “[focus] on rolling out eBay’s managed payments experience for our customers”.

Payments group Stripe said that in spite of its exit it still believed Libra had “potential” to “make online commerce more accessible for people around the world” and remained open to working with the project “at a later stage”.


Two people familiar with the decisions said that Mastercard and Mercado Pago had also quit Libra.

The Libra alliance, a group largely made up of finance and technology companies, had each decided to put at least $10m behind the scheme. The remaining members are due to meet in Geneva on Monday to nominate the board for the project.

Some of the initial members were spooked after it emerged that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, will testify in front of Congress about the plans later this month, according to several people familiar with the project.

In addition, earlier this week, two Democratic senators wrote to Mastercard, Visa and Stripe to express concern about the project and urge them to reconsider the risks the project poses to the government and the financial system as a whole.

Sherrod Brown and Brian Schatz, two members of the Senate banking committee, wrote in their letters: “If you take this on, you can expect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities.”

Mr Brown said on Friday: “Large payment companies are wise to avoid legitimising Facebook’s private, global currency. Facebook is too big and too powerful, and it is unconscionable for financial companies to aid it in monopolising our economic infrastructure. I trust others will see the wisdom of avoiding this ill-conceived undertaking.”

People close to the companies said all three of the companies addressed by the senators were concerned about the threat of closer regulatory scrutiny on their business. PayPal had said when it dropped out that it wanted to “focus on our existing mission”.

Why am I so sure? What kind of project? Do people need it? Where does the price increase come from?

This token is the only thing on the  blockchain in Your Price Booking project, but, incidentally, like the  BAT token in the Brave browser.

An important element of every economy  is currency. So, in a completely non-blockchain project – a platform  that will allow you to book accommodation on travel several times  cheaper, which is more beneficial for hoteliers and users, the internal  currency is the YPI token.

But tourists would pay with hotels and apartments in classic fiat currency of course and also in Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether.

## How does the YPI token attract investors?

You can buy cheaper and sell more expensive and it will be beneficial for everyone.

In total there is 1M. The team has 300K left. 700K is put up for ICO in this order:

&amp;#x200B;

* the first 100K at  price of 0.0001 ETH;
* second 200K at  price of 0.0005 ETH;
* the third 300K at price of 0.0025 ETH;
* fourth 100K at  price of 0.01 ETH;

Smart contract 0x9e2AAA62d69E49F6767996C07c240A15495aCE91 and git hub https://github.com/Maestro12345678/YPI-token.

## Aggressive deflation, too, over time there will be only 1 YPI with a price of at least 1,000,000 Dollars.

The ypbooking.com platform will be  launched after the sale of the first 300K YPI tokens. Listing of each  tourist site, hotel, apartment, villa, attic would cost the hotelier  from 100 to 300 Euro per year. Yes, it’s so small compared to  competitors who take from 10% to 20% from each transaction.

Hoteliers would pay through their  euros through  exchange that will buy YPI tokens from a smart contract,  and then from  exchange.

All YPI tokens received in the first  year would be burned at 100%, the second year at 50%, the third at 20%  and then Your Price Booking would burn 10% of  tokens received from  hoteliers all their life.

Ypbooking would earn with any number  of remaining tokens on its services, and investors would earn a lot of  money on the deflation model of YPI tokens."

I'm a bit desperate, so I hope I'm posting this in the right place. My mum invested in a company called cryptoadvice and I need to know if this is a scam. It sure feels like one...

Some background info:

Forgive me, but I could not gather that much info of now. What I know is that my mother met a woman not that long ago who she quickly became ""friends"" with. This woman now convinced her to invest in something called ""cryptoadvice"".

My mother never had much money, she is living in a small apartment and in a few years she will get a laughable pension. When she found out how little it was, she was crushed. Suddenly this woman presented her with the idea of taking money out of her life insurance and investing it. My mum fell for it and invested the money she had saved. Now she wants to invest even more. If this is a scam I need to stop her!

What will follow now is a wall of text on what I could dig up so far. But the TLDR of this post is:

**If you can find out something about this or you by chance have any experience with this ""cryptoadvice company"" please help me. My mum wants to invest even more money there by tonight and I have to gather any information I can on them!**

What I found out about cryptoadvice so far (please bear with me, I don't know shit about crypto currency):

Dice Games (this seems to be something shady/bad?)
**
Also: If you as an investor get someone else to invest in this too, you get a provision of 5% of the deposit.**

For this section I'm using a translator, because I found it in a german article and can't translate it fully myself:

The business model offered by cryptoadvice is not based on any retail products or services that have to be rebuilt over and over again. This makes the investment in CryptoAdvice highly risky, because it would depend, for example, on failed investments by the influx of ever new funds.

On the website of Crytoadvice can be found in the imprint of the company Mended Minds Ltd. based in London. The company apparently entered in business register in 2018 in Cardiff, Wales. The website went online in 2018. These are Mendes Minds Ltd. with the brand CryproAdvice to a company not regulated by the FCA.

This is problematic because whenever the investors' money is invested by the investment managers of a company, and thus there is no pure intermediary activity, under European law licensing and regulation by the competent financial supervisory authority is required. On the one hand, while there is talk of CryptoAdvice being a platform, on the other hand, money or crypto-money is being talked about by in-house investment managers.

CEO of CryptoAdvice is Jordan Lucas. This is a real person who has nothing to do with American football player Jordan Lucas of Kansas City. Of course, we did not know if the name was real, but the person on the webpage is the same as the presentations in some YouTube videos. At the events, juicy checks are handed over to cheers and the mood is heated up with a view to top returns and epoch-making sound. This sounds super obvious to me...

The connection with QuickX behind the QCX token also makes us listen. QuickX is a Malta-based company, also part of Mended Minds Ltd. and Jordan Luke. QuickX and QCX tokens are obviously also linked to an Indian development team. The QXC tokens will obviously be pushed through the affiliate program as well as with the investments by CryptoAdvice.

Affiliate partners, for example, have to deposit QCX tokens to get the returns paid out in QCX as well. However, the QCX investments are committed for one year. This means that no payouts can be made for at least one year. The lock is justified by the fact that no price decline of the QCX should take place. That is, however, with pure folly mischief.

The one-year ban on withdrawals, it may be suspected in critical view, could also have been added as a brake for a premature collapse of a ""house of cards"". However, since we do not want to work with guesses, it remains with the indication that the justification for the one-year lock is rationally incomprehensible.
**
So to me this sounds like a scam where people are talked into investing in ""cryptoadvice"" by people who already did so and are now trying to get the 5% by recruiting other investors.**

I hope someone can help me here, I'm sorry for the long post.

Edit: Found a video of someone looking into the company. Maybe he can explain the company a little better:

151,2019-11-20,overview12,1,Stablecoins: What You Need to Know,"Stablecoins reside at the intersection of cryptocurrencies and traditional finance. They simplify the transfer of funds between crypto exchanges. Stablecoins make purchases faster and less expensive and are used as a medium of exchange, a means of storing value, and a unit of account. In 2012, Mastercoin proposed a stable-value cryptocurrency, which was later renamed as Omni.

A collateralized stablecoins is pegged to assets such as national currencies, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. In centralized models, the stablecoin issuers back the value of their coin by holding the asset.

A Stablecoin’s value is pegged, for instance, to the USD at a 1:1 fixed exchange rate. Other stablecoins are pegged to the price of crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, with algorithms that manage supply and demand of the coin and the reserves. Regardless of how a stablecoin is backed, its value is in its price stability.

In a crypto-collateralized arrangement, a cryptocurrency backs a stablecoin, while seigniorage tokens are not collateralized by anything other than software, which maintains the price stability. A hybrid stablecoin might blend the three above approaches.

**Fiat-backed Stablecoin**

Fiat-backed stablecoins are backed by fiat currencies at a 1:1 ratio. Custodians manage the fiat in such an arrangement by holding the proper amount of backing currency in an account. Fiat-backed tokens can be issued or destroyed by the custodian as needed to maintain the peg. Stablecoins today are backed by the euro, Japanese yen, and other fiat currencies. Of course, stablecoins where funds are held in bank accounts or by third-parties are susceptible to fraud.

A problem with fiat-backed stablecoins is their centralization.

**Commodity-Backed Stablecoin**

Commodity-backed stablecoins are pegged to a commodity, such as gold or silver. A token could be backed by one gram of gold stored in a third-party custodian’s vaults.

These stablecoins are backed by one or more commodities. The backing commodity must reflect the circulating supply of the stablecoin.

**Cryptocurrency-Backed Stablecoin**

A Crypto-collateralized stablecoin is backed by a cryptocurrency and sometimes a basket thereof. Certain mathematical innovations were needed in order to make such a stablecoin possible. These stablecoins are considered a more decentralized alternative to other stablecoins.

A major difference between this type of stablecoin and the abovementioned types is the former is handled on blockchain, with smart contracts, where the latter are done in the physical world through bank accounts or gold custodians.

These stablecoins are oftentimes more complex and require more collateral, due to the volatile nature of the backing cryptocurrencies themselves, than the abovementioned stablecoins.

**Seigniorage-Style Stablecoin**

A seigniorage-Style stablecoin is stabilized by an algorithm. The algorithm could, for instance, control the supply of the seigniorage-style stablecoin. New stablecoins can be minted to stabilize prices if demand for the stablecoin increases.

**Libra, JPMorgan Coin &amp; The Stablecoin Market**

Big institutions have shown interest in creating their own stablecoins. Facebook’s Libra is a stablecoin, because the social networking site sees stablecoins as a potential bridge between the existing world of government-issued money and a crypto-based future.

Stablecoins are also gaining attention from the likes of JPMorgan Chase Inc. According to Facebook, Libra will be backed by “a collection of low-volatility assets, such as bank deposits and short-term government securities in currencies from stable and reputable central banks.” Libra’s value will fluctuate in the same manner that the US dollar varies compared with the euro or yen from day-to-day. Exchanges will be established so that users can convert fiat for Libra.

JP Morgan says its JPM coin will enable fast money transfers between its corporate customers on an internal, private blockchain. JPM Coin is backed by the U.S. dollars held by the bank.

The Federal Reserve has been advised to [consider](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/central-bankers-told-they-should-be-sprinting-toward-blockchain) stablecoins, and the central bank of Sweden is planning a pilot project with an “e-krona” later this year.

**Money on Chain: A Bitcoin-Backed Stablecoin**

Money on Chain foresees big things for stablecoins, too. That’s why in 2015 we started to work on a stablecoin for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

We chose to design a stablecoin on top of Bitcoin because it allowed us to build a truly decentralized stablecoin. We believe Bitcoin’s decentralization and censorship resistance is crucial to a stablecoin.

We’ve created a stablecoin pegged to the American Dollar (Dollar On Chain) that incentivizes various participants in the Bitcoin systems.

Money On Chain is made by Bitcoiners for Bitcoiners.

Market volatility is as close to certainty as death and taxes—as such, investors need to allocate their capital to alternative assets outside of equities, such as gold. Another option, dubbed “digital gold” in the sphere is crypto assets like Bitcoin, but an alternate opportunity marries the concept of gold and crypto assets’ underlying technology (blockchain)—[PMGT](https://www.pmgt.io), a digital gold token by [InfiniGold](https://www.infinigold.com/)."

160,2019-12-12,Imtuso,1,Opinions on investing with blockchain lending companies?,"Coming from a country where access to vanguard, a 401k or any short of decent investment account is minimal or a huge hustle to get. I went on the journey to find a good way on getting a decent return on my investment, manageable and hustle free and after a long search I found Celsius Network. 

It is a totally transparent blockchain ""bank"" that generates profit by lending the deposited crypto from their customers to exchanges and hedge funds,they also do Fiat loans to customers and all of them are collateralized over 50%. It was created by the same guy who created VoiP so before you say this is any short of scam or Ponzi because of the yearly rates they are being able to offer, do your due diligence and read about it on how it works and what it's trying to solve ""Their main job is to unbank the banks by giving the service they only give to their shareholders"" There are some safety measures that they take in case you want to read about it... You can check it online. 

What the creator did to the big telephone companies by creating Voice over IP (VoIP) he is trying to do it to the banks by giving 80% back to the community. 
 
I’ve been using Celsius Network for some time now and I can give an honest review on how well the interest is performing

I deposited some Bitcoin back in July and started gaining interest on average is a 5%-6% per year(It is paid every Monday on Btc or in their own coin CEL, you can choose what you want), but then they started adding the stable dollar coins and they are paying 8-10% yearly so now I'm doing monthly contributions.

This is a new system that is never been used before by society, so what are your opinions on it?

Also don't be that negative because I already know the comments that will come up comparing to bitconnect or something like that. Just for comparison bitconnect was giving 1% daily and this is giving on usd coin 8% yearly. 

If you are interested and like the FIRE journey but cannot achieve it because of where you live I think this is a great start.

So what you guys think?

P. S: The company has over 400M USD in assets at the moment so it is not that small, it has also passed 4 billion in loans, we are 60k members, deposits and member grow by a 4-5% weekly."
161,2019-12-11,Jueban,1,Why was Facebook's Libra killed off? A blockchain firm advised by Nobel laureate Myron Scholes just launched a rival to Facebook’s Libra,"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/10/saga-launches-sga-token-to-rival-facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency.html

&gt; Saga is launching a virtual currency which pegs its value to the basket of currencies that form the IMF’s special drawing rights.
The U.K.-based company’s advisory board includes the likes of Nobel laureate Myron Scholes and J.P. Morgan’s Jacob Frenkel.
But the firm doesn’t plan to launch its token in the U.S. yet, claiming it doesn’t currently have the regulatory clarity required to do so.

&gt; One blockchain company thinks it has an alternative to Facebook’s digital currency proposal.

&gt; With an advisory board that includes top economists like Nobel Prize-winner Myron Scholes, U.K.-based firm Saga hopes to introduce a global currency that regulators find agreeable.

&gt; The company on Tuesday launched its saga (SGA) token, a virtual currency tied to a basket of currencies in order to maintain a stable value. That’s not too dissimilar to Facebook’s libra, which was met with a barrage of regulatory opposition moments after being announced. But one key thing that sets it apart from that project is what Saga bases the currency’s value on.

&gt; Rather than creating a new asset basket like libra’s, Saga is pegging its token’s value to bank deposits in the same group of currencies that form the International Monetary Fund’s special drawing rights (SDR) — these are international reserve assets held by central banks to supplement their official reserves. The basket is heavily weighted in dollars, as well as the euro, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen and British pound."
