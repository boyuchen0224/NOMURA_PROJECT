0,2019-01-31,sm4shc4sh,1,Apple Is Planning 3-D Cameras for New iPhones in AR Push,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-30/apple-is-said-to-prep-new-3-d-camera-for-2020-iphones-in-ar-push](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-30/apple-is-said-to-prep-new-3-d-camera-for-2020-iphones-in-ar-push?srnd=premium-europe)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Apple Inc. plans to launch iPhones with a more-powerful 3-D camera as soon as next year, stepping up the company’s push into augmented reality, according to people familiar with the plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The rear-facing, longer-range 3-D camera is designed to scan the environment to create three-dimensional reconstructions of the real world. It will work up to about 15 feet from the device, the people said. That’s in contrast with the current iPhone 3-D camera system, which points toward users and operates at distances of 25 to 50 centimeters to power Apple’s Face ID facial-recognition feature.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s new system uses a laser scanner, rather than the existing dot-projection technology which doesn’t work as well over longer distances, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unreleased features. That’s just one of many new features -- including a third, more advanced camera, enhanced photo-capture tools and a more powerful chip -- that Apple plans to include in coming generations of iPhones, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The laser-powered 3-D camera would enhance augmented reality on the iPhone, allowing for more accurate depth perception and placement of virtual objects. It could also help the handset take photos that can better capture depth, the people said. Apple has been in talks with Sony Corp. about testing sensors for the new system, one of the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;While virtual reality immerses the user in a digital realm, AR overlays visuals and data onto a view of the real world. Use cases include looking at a building and displaying details of the structure beside the image, or listing repair instructions for a mechanic while she works on a defective machine. It’s been touted as having wider mass-market appeal than VR, and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has talked up its prospects.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 2020 iPhone camera may be a prelude to an AR headset that Apple has been preparing for as early as 2020. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s plans, which could change.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple previously aimed to put the new 3-D camera system on the back of this year’s high-end iPhones, but delayed that, the people familiar also said. Still, the Cupertino, California-based technology giant is doubling down on camera capabilities for its handsets.  
&gt;  
&gt;For 2019, Apple plans successors to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max -- code-named D42 and D43 -- and an update to the iPhone XR, said the people. The larger of the new high-end iPhones will have three cameras on the back, and other handsets could eventually come with the upgraded system, too, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Cameras have become one of the most-important features in a saturated smartphone market. Better photos are a compelling reason for people to upgrade their handsets, especially when other new capabilities are either harder to design or too wonky for most customers to appreciate. Apple pioneered smartphone camera improvements, which over the years have included additions like Portrait Mode. Rivals have tried to catch up, with Samsung Electronics Co. launching phones with as many as four outward-facing cameras last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The iPhone still generates the majority of Apple’s revenue, although sales of the devices fell last year as people upgraded less often. That triggered a stock slump that wiped more than $300 billion off the company’s market value since October. New models with more-capable cameras could spur upgrades and reignite Apple’s growth, making these upcoming iPhones the most critical in years.  
&gt;  
&gt;A third camera on the back of the 2019 iPhone will help the device capture a larger field of view and enable a wider range of zoom. It will also capture more pixels so Apple software could, for example, automatically repair a video or photo to fit in a subject that may have been accidentally cut off from the initial shot, according to the people familiar with the plans. The company is also planning an enhanced version of its Live Photos feature, which pins video from before and after each shot to the photo. The new version will double the length of the video from three seconds to six seconds.  
&gt;  
&gt;The laser-powered 3-D camera could debut first on an upgrade to the iPad Pro currently planned for as early as spring 2020, according to one of the people. Apple isn’t expected to release a major iPad Pro update this year like it did in 2018. It typically upgrades the line in the second half of the year. Apple in the past has launched major new features on the iPad before the iPhone, including 4G internet connectivity in 2012.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple is also testing some versions of this year’s iPhone line that includes a USB-C connector instead of the Lightning port that has been used on iPhones since 2012, indicating that the company plans an eventual switch, according to one of the people. Moving to USB-C would make the new models compatible with chargers used for hundreds of other devices, like Android phones.  
&gt;  
&gt;This year’s iPhone models will include an upgraded Apple processor and use an updated Face ID sensor for unlocking the device and approving payments, the people said. The handsets will otherwise look similar to the current models with larger changes expected as early as 2020 to accommodate plans for 5G networking capabilities, Bloomberg News reported last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Beyond iPhones, Apple plans to release an updated version of its lower-cost iPad with a roughly 10-inch screen and a faster processor as early as this spring, according to people familiar with the plans. That device is expected to retain the Lightning port, according to one of the people. The company is also readying a new, cheaper iPad mini, its smallest tablet that hasn’t been updated since 2015, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apple’s next operating system update, iOS 13, will include a dark mode option for easier nighttime viewing and improvements to CarPlay, the company’s in-vehicle software. There will also be iPad-specific upgrades like a new home screen, the ability to tab through multiple versions of a single app like pages in a web browser, and improvements to file management. The company will also integrate two new services, including a magazine subscription service and its original video content efforts, via iOS updates this year.   
&gt;  
&gt;Each year since 2012, Apple has launched its latest iPhone in September. The one exception was the iPhone X’s November release in 2017."

&amp;#x200B;

Here are on my radar (Don't hold any yet), but will probably own 1 of these in the future:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **AT&amp;T (T):** Dividend &gt;5%, P/E ratio at 11.28 (below average), and recently invested to gain streaming rights  to show original movies and television series from Warner Bros., Turner and HBO. Taking into consideration the overall success Netflix, a successful launch could help charge up AT&amp;T's share price, but this would be a slow process as competition will be fierce (Amazon Prime and Disney), and i doubt many people will be willing to have multiple streaming services accounts. 

2. **Apple (AAPL)**: I believe apple will continue hitting new lows, the Chinese market has lost its appetite for apple cellphones, specially after Trump's Tariff and how pricey these devices have become. I also heard that the Chinese do everything through Wechat, and apple does not support this app.   


Long term catalyst would be the introduction of 5G network (as I am hoping for AT&amp;T) which should get a lot of people willing to upgrade their phone, apple also has the highest retention of cellphone users (\~96%), but I want to see how they plan to regain the Chinese market or if they will expand to other emerging countries like china to continue its growth. 

&amp;#x200B;

3.  **Paypal (PYPL) -** As more people prefer to buy online (E-Commerce), companies like Paypal, Visa and Mastercard are bound to benefit.  In its last quarter, the company reported 15% increase of active accounts. It is currently trading at a higher P/E ratio than i'd prefer to buy it at, so I will be looking for significant dips in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that this is just my opinion, and wanted to share it to get your feedback and hopefully read what stocks you are planning to buy and why. "

5,2019-02-24,closingbell,132,Trump Vents Frustration With Trade Czar as China Talks Continue,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump and his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, have grown increasingly frustrated with each other as a China trade deal stays elusive with a key deadline less than a week away, said people inside and close to the administration.

The exasperation between the two erupted into the open during an unusual public exchange in front of China’s top negotiator, assembled U.S. officials and journalists on Friday, during which Trump took issue with Lighthizer’s explanation that any deal would take the form of a memorandum of understanding.

“I don’t like MOUs because they don’t mean anything,’’ the president said, before shooting down Lighthizer when the career lawyer described such documents as legally binding.

After Friday’s exchange, said two people familiar with the events, the president complained that Lighthizer had embarrassed him by publicly correcting him in front of the Chinese delegation and the press. The president also expressed frustration that Lighthizer hadn’t yet stitched up a deal that Trump views as increasingly important.

Talks between Lighthizer and other senior U.S. officials and Xi’s special envoy, Liu He, continued on Saturday and were due to resume on Sunday. In a post on Twitter, the president said Sunday that the weekend talks have been “very productive.”

“The talks with China are still ongoing. Thanks to President Trump’s firm leadership we are making strong progress on substantive structural issues,’’ a senior USTR official said in response to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.

Trump’s disappointment with his trade czar has built in recent months, according to people close to the administration, fueled by the stock market’s precipitous drop in late 2018 as the trade war with China escalated. U.S. stocks logged their worst December performance since the Great Depression, and had their biggest annual decline since 2008.

Lighthizer, a longtime China hawk, was one of the chief architects of the policy that led to Trump imposing tariffs on some $250 billion in imports from China. While Trump has declared himself to be a “Tariff Man,” he’s also been increasingly eager to close what he’s pre-emptively billed as an historic deal with China.

For his part, Lighthizer, 71, who’s spent years arguing for a tougher trade stand against China, has been growing irritated with Trump’s interventions, according to people familiar with the administration’s internal deliberations.

Trump, Xi

In recent weeks Trump has said that a deal would only be concluded when he and Xi held their own summit to iron out the final differences. Trump has also publicly raised the possibility of extending a March 1 deadline for tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent.

Those moves and Friday’s public Oval Office disagreement have been read as weakening Lighthizer’s hand in the talks with China. Lighthizer’s frustration hasn’t reached the level where he’s likely to resign, said one person familiar with internal White House deliberations. But officials from USTR have been making calls to surrogates thanking them for holding a tough line on China talks publicly.

Another person close to Lighthizer on Saturday disputed that there was any rift with the president or any other administration officials, insisting that Trump’s trade boss was liaising daily with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and others including the president, and that the talks were continuing to make progress.

Open Frustrations

Other China hawks in the administration and in Congress, however, have been more open about their frustration.

They worry that, having built up considerable leverage through his tariffs, Trump has become too focused on cutting a deal to calm financial markets, and that any agreement may fail to address core issues such as intellectual property theft. The concern is that a deal could end up seeing only a short-term increase in Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural and energy products.

“No matter how many tons of soybeans they buy if China gets to keep cheating &amp; stealing trade secrets it won’t be a good deal for America, our workers or our national security,’’ Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida tweeted on Friday after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said China offered to buy 10 million tons of soybeans as talks continued.

Post-Truce Flight

On the flight back from the leaders’ Dec. 1 dinner in Argentina, at which a 90-day truce was agreed, the president tasked Lighthizer with getting a China deal. When Lighthizer told him that he believed Beijing wasn’t ready to make meaningful concessions, Trump insisted a resolution had to be found, according to one person briefed on the exchange.

Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow have been making the case to the president that investors expect a deal, and not getting one would cause U.S. stock markets, which have started the year strongly on trade optimism, to stumble again, according to people familiar with internal deliberations.

They’ve also advised Trump to hold off on issuing an executive order that would ban Huawei Technologies Co. and other Chinese telecoms equipment from U.S. networks for fear taking action against Chinese companies would undermine the trade negotiations.

Hawks in the administration worry that Trump will ultimately not take a tough stance against those companies, even though they’ve been accused of espionage and trade secret theft and U.S. officials including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo have been traveling the world urging allies not to use any Huawei or ZTE Corp. equipment in new 5G networks.

Sure, they pay great dividends, but they also have a very high payout ratio meaning they will not be able to continue to pay dividends like this for much longer. They also have a very large amount of debt and they have stiff competition in the 5G area. I don't see many good reasons to invest in them and it seems like an unsafe gamble in my opinion. I'd like to hear why people are bullish on this stock."

12,2019-03-24,no_clue_guy14,0,Stadia and the Future of the Gaming Industry,"So about Stadia.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like it is potentially a game-changer of the gaming industry, in a way like how Spotify changed the business model of the music industry.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all if it rolls out successfully and is well-received, the consoles sales (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) are gonna be adversely affected. With Stadia you only need an average PC to play games at 4K, 60FPS, which consoles currently cannot do. Depending on the price tag of Stadia, it may come even cheaper than the console set (Game purchasing, online fee (e.g. PS Plus)). I am a loyal fan to the PS series but with Stadia I am seriously considering switching over. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure how Stadia plans to release the games to its user. But at first it seems to me that whoever subscribed to Stadia is able to play the games under its wing. If that's the case then the game developers are to some extents ""controlled"" by Stadia as it will become the primary platform they release their game contents to.

&amp;#x200B;

However there is the internet speed issue and the delay of input. FPS is gonna be the most sensitive to it and FPS is a big chunk of the current gaming market. This could be solved by having 5G generalized for the public but who knows how long we need to wait for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Penny for thoughts. What do you think about the future of the gaming industry?"

14,2019-03-08,chiseeger,4,5G - Which companies to target?,"I’d like to start researching companies that are going to have a big role in producing the products and technology that support the new 5G infrastructure. It’s becoming clear to me that this is a pretty big network build out, not just is the states, but worldwide. I’d like to ride that macro trend. 

Can anyone suggest some products or areas to start looking at?

So far I’ve identified that I should look at these companies:
- Qualcomm - tech that will be used all over and they will collect licensing fees 
- ZTE and Hauwei - appliances and equipment in China
- Intel - I heard they are manufacturing very specific hardware. Not sure it’ll move the needle for them. 
- HPE - has a software testing suite all 5G deployers will use. Again not sure that’ll move the needle of a behemoth
- Ericsson - hardware

I’ve also learned Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) tech will be very important for this roll out. Are there any underlying technologies someone could share that’ll play a big role in 5G being successful?

They already have a Gen2 5G Chip ready to ship to phone manufacturers while their two biggest competitors are either behind or being outlawed. Intel hasn’t even created a Gen1 Chip and won’t have the chips ready until after 2020. Huawei is caught doing illegal shit even though they have a really good chip. Although Qualcomm cut ties with Apple, they still got Samsung to supply the chips too which is of course a powerhouse when it comes to phones. It’s crazy to think that Qualcomm is already on their Gen2 chip while Intel hasn’t even started. By the time intel comes out with their own thing, who knows where Qualcomm will be? They’re relatively cheap right now after the whole Apple fiasco so I think right now is a great time to get into Qualcomm. "

5G network growth with AT&amp;T, AMT, CCI, Verizon as another example.

Now these only come once in awhile so how is the strategy of holding your money in a good index like S&amp;P/Diversified Bonds/Tech/Bio and then once or twice a year when you see the opportunity to put into these 2 - 3 year plays then when those stocks come to fruition a few years later to sell them if you want to move to a better investment or keep investing into the same if you believe there is more room for growth?

Also, are there any sources on how the four major carriers are going to afford the rollout (I couldn't find specifics from the respective 10Ks)? From the information I have been reading, 5G will require hundreds, if not thousands, of more towers than 4G. Some time ago the Trump admin suggested that the private sector will do it all themselves. Has there been any appropriation of funds from the US gov for the rollout? I know ATT is strapped to its heals in debt, so I wonder how they will accomplish this rollout specifically.

32,2019-07-30,newwideworld,0,Why did Huawei catch flak for the Iran sanctions while Samsung continues to operate without any issues?,"Because Samsung is 51% owned by US.

Huawei is 100% owned by Chinese &amp; all their 180,000 workers.

Huawei 5G and smart phones since 2018 had leapfrog the world to become leader. So its a national threat to US unless its sold to US companies.

https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/standards/how-america-can-prepare-to-live-in-chinas-5g-world

US unilateral sanction on Iran is illegal and violated UN international law, besides violating JCPOA signed by UNSC all 5 Permanent Members &amp; Germany as guarantors.

But how did well funded &amp; profitable Samsung chebol responsible for SK 25% GDP fell into US hand?

In 1997, US had George Soros &amp; wallstreet raiders orchestrated Asia financial crisis by short selling both currency &amp; stock market simultaneously to bankrupt all Asia that were all actually growing healthily at ave 5~8%.

Only below few survived. The rest are forced to take IMF loans on condition they will sell all strategic assets to West funds.

Japan survived because its economy and strategic assets was already largely controlled by US after 1987 dismantled of Toshiba, followed by Plaza Accords.

https://www.checkpointasia.net/today-the-us-is-waging-a-war-on-huawei-in-1987-it-was-japans-toshiba/

https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-old-u-s-trade-war-with-japan-looms-over-todays-dispute-with-china-11544717163
China &amp; India survived because their currency is not free float. NK too, because not trading its currency. So their economy continue to grow unaffected.

HK survived due to China intervention to buy every stock &amp; HK dollar shorted with its huge reserves. US raiders lost so much that US gov was very unhappy with China.

Spore survived with its huge $200B foreign reserve, but depleted much of it to US raiders. Spore gov tried to regulate such illegal speculations, but US gov threatened to sanction Spore if it did for violating free trading rule. Eventually it was compromised with an Unequal Treaty signed, Spore gov undertaken to compensate every US corps losses arises (unlimited) should it ever regulate stock &amp; forex trading in time of crisis.

Malaysia then PM Mahathir simply fixed $1=3.5Rm against US-WB &amp; EU-IMF ferocious sanction threat &amp; blamed for not following international norm. Norm means to let its currency crash to $1=5~7Rm according to West speculators short selling rate. US &amp; EU insisted Msia was already bankrupted and needed to take IMF loan with string attached, i.e. sell all its assets to West. Msia refused, and it survive unscathed, becoming a classic study case of IMF on how to survive a West financial attack.

However, SK won &amp; stock market were both badly hit like the rest, forcing it to take IMF loan. So IMF forced SK to sell all its priced asset to US at fire sales cost, i.e. Samsung that control 25% of SK GDP. Since, its allowed to grow quickly &amp; access all technologies.

That's reason why US gov has no concern of security to insisted Samsung develop 5G mmWave 28Ghz for US 5G market. US wanted to avoid using sub 6Ghz technology that Huawei is dominating.

Why France Alstom, the No.1 leader in energy solution and turbine, need to sell off to GM?Because US arrested its top executives and threaten its CEO.

34,2019-07-16,longtermthrowaway02,0,A basic explanation/guide on 5G,"An in depth guide on 5G

What is 5G:

5G is the fifth generation cellular network technology. The industry association 3GPP defines any system using ""5G NR"" software as ""5G"", a definition that came into general use by late 2018. 


Why is 5G useful? How much better is it than 4G?:

Theoretically 5G at maximum potential is roughly 100 times faster than 4G, this is useful for downloading and processing information. This is in theory of course, 5G by 2020 shouldn’t be even close to this level but it’s realistic to expect 5G to be over 20 times faster than 4G. It promises mobile data speeds that far outstrip the fastest home broadband network.


Home broadband internet vs 5G:

Eventually The classic broadband internet will be replaced by 5G as its multiple times faster.


What technology’s will implement 5G technology?:

Tons of technology’s are implementing 5G such as, remote surgery; 5G networks essentially mean a patient doesn’t need to be in the same room as a surgeon for surgery, simply using vr technology, robotics and 5G.

Self driving cars will also be 100% 5G powered, many in the industry don't believe a fully autonomous vehicle is possible without a 5G network.

Drones:

Similarly, 5G will unlock the true capability of drones. Lynn Comp, director of market development at Intel, cited the example of a drone flying over an oil drill with a video camera. The network will allow for precise control of the drone, while sending back high-definition video.

Virtual reality:

5G heavily enables virtual reality to advance to the next level, Sprint Chief Operating Officer Gunther Ottendorfer said he expects to see a return of game arcades -- but focused on virtual reality.




Great 5G is substantially useful what stocks should I invest in/who’s winning:

Currently China is winning the 5G race, its carriers have promised to create fully operation commercial networks by 2020, and in total they’ve outspent the US by approximately 24 billion dollars.
China has a significant advantage as they have built 350 thousand 5G enabled cell towers where as us only has built 30 thousand in the same time range.
Japan is also a significant contender matching up with China, So for now it seems Asia as a continent will get 5G before USA.


The US has stopped supplying huawei with chips in hope that it stops china from winning the race.


The major stocks involved in us should be sprint with its merge with t mobile merger if it gets accepted, and also at&amp;t, Verizon is also another contender albeit there’s less headlines with them and 5G. The merger between t mobile and sprint has already passed through quite a bit and experts agree that it’s most likely going to be accepted.

Sorry if the formatting looks hideous.

37,2019-08-24,ElektroShokk,0,The trade war is leverage against Chinese tech right?,"Someone please tell me if im missing something.

A major reason(?) we're in a trade war is because China has better telecommunication technology and are better at 5g. They have a plan to be fully integrated with 5g soon and the US is 5 years behind in comparison.


So what who cares... Well last time the Americans got to 4g first and they made serious money being the distributors of the tech. Now, however, China is first to adopt and they could supply the world with their 5g tech for FIVE YEARS before we butt in.

The difference between 4g and 5g is astronomical. 3 minutes to download a two hour movie for 4g, compared to 3.5 SECONDS with 5g. Near 0 latency.

Theres almost three times as much to make from 5g compared to 4g and the US is losing hard.

With these tarrifs, the US has leverage. They are hurting China more, but Winnie the Pooh is stubborn enough to wait out Trumps term and talk to a competent leader. That's why Trump is big mad today.

Now, Trump and Pooh can make a deal without either looking like bitches to their base.

My question is, why did a private company and private investors think they could sell public assets and pocket billions of dollars? Are we really at that stage of delusion?

 [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/intelsat-stock-drops-as-fcc-will-auction-satellite-spectrum-for-5g.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/intelsat-stock-drops-as-fcc-will-auction-satellite-spectrum-for-5g.html) 

 

&gt;The Federal Communications Commission announced on Monday that it will publicly auction off a valuable telecommunications asset, in a move investors viewed as a blow to U.S. satellite communications provider [Intelsat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=I).  
&gt;  
&gt;Shares of [Intelsat](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=I) dropped 40% in heavy trading volume after FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a tweet that his agency “must free up significant spectrum” for 5G telecommunications. The FCC told CNBC that it expects an auction to happen “before the end of 2020.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’ve concluded that the best way to advance these principles is through a public auction of 280 megahertz of the C-band,” Pai said. “I’m confident they’ll quickly conduct a public auction that will give everyone a fair chance to compete.”  
&gt;  
&gt;C-band spectrum is a key telecommunications wavelength the FCC regulates. Four satellite operators, including Intelsat, provide C-band services in the U.S. to about 120 million households. The FCC wants to repurpose the C-band spectrum for 5G and an auction is expected to raise tens of billions of dollars. But a public auction would see the proceeds go to the government, an option the satellite operators – organized as the C-Band Alliance – have opposed.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The fundamental issue here is that there’s the ideal and there’s the practical. Everyone recognizes the best use of this spectrum is for 5G services – but what is the most economical and timely way to do that?” Chris Quilty, president of satellite financial services firm Quilty Analytics, told CNBC. Quilty formerly led Raymond James’ coverage of sattellite communications and the broader space industry for 20 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;The C-Band Alliance [has been pushing for a private auction](https://spacenews.com/c-band-alliance-says-it-would-send-billions-to-u-s-treasury-under-private-spectrum-auction/). The group on Friday gave a proposal to the FCC where the satellite operators would keep some of the proceeds while paying taxes on the sale, as well as contributing at least $8 billion to the U.S. Treasury and possible helping fund a rural 5G network.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The private auction would generate billions in proceeds for Intelsat and the other C-band operators,” Quilty said. “The potential C-band proceeds gave Intelsat a path for deleveraging, which has otherwise escaped the company for the past 10 years.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Intelsat had a market value of about $1.8 billion before trading began on Monday. Even before the latest drop, Intelsat’s stock had declined more than 10% on three consecutive trading days as the tide shifted against the C-Band Alliance. The FCC’s announcement of a public auction means the satellite companies may not recoup the value of their C-Band investments, such as the expensive satellites.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What we’ll likely see happen, which is the worst case scenario, is that the satellite operators have every incentive to drag their heels and take this to the courts, because they’re no longer being compensated for this spectrum,” Quilty said. “People are assuming they’re still going to get something but they’re not going to get the $8 billion to $10 billion windfall they were expecting.”"

&gt;BROOKFIELD, NEWS, Dec. 23, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cincinnati Bell Inc. (NYSE:CBB), together with Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIP; TSX: BIP.UN), today announced an agreement through which Brookfield Infrastructure and its institutional partners will acquire Cincinnati Bell in a transaction valued at approximately $2.6 billion, including debt (the “Transaction”).  
&gt;  
&gt;Pursuant to the agreement, each issued and outstanding share of Cincinnati Bell common stock will be converted into the right to receive $10.50 in cash at closing of the Transaction. The Transaction price of $10.50 per share of Cincinnati Bell common stock represents a 36% premium to the closing per share price of $7.72 on December 20, 2019 and an 84% premium to the 60-day volume weighted average price. The Transaction has received unanimous approval of Cincinnati Bell’s Board of Directors and is subject to customary closing conditions, including Cincinnati Bell shareholder approval and regulatory approval.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lynn A. Wentworth, Chairman of the Cincinnati Bell Board of Directors, said, “After thoroughly reviewing a range of strategic alternatives and possible business opportunities for maximizing value, the Board determined this transaction was in the best interest of the company, its shareholders, and its customers. The transaction provides clear and immediate value at an attractive premium and represents an exciting new chapter for Cincinnati Bell.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Leigh Fox, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cincinnati Bell, continued, “The transaction strengthens our financial position, enabling accelerated investment in our strategic products that is not presently available to Cincinnati Bell as a standalone company. This will allow us to drive growth and maximize value over the long term to the benefit of all our stakeholders. With Brookfield Infrastructure’s support, we will be better positioned to deliver next generation, integrated communications for our customers through an expanded fiber network. Brookfield Infrastructure provides strong industry expertise with a proven track record of investment in critical data service and infrastructure. The financial, management, and other resources made available to Cincinnati Bell through the acquisition will enhance our networks and services to the benefit of our customers in Hawaii, Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, and across the nation.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“This investment represents an opportunity for Brookfield Infrastructure to acquire a great franchise and leading fiber network operator in North America,” said Sam Pollock, Chief Executive Officer of Brookfield Infrastructure. “We are excited to leverage our operating expertise to work with the company’s management team as it completes its industry-leading fiber optic rollout plan. Cincinnati Bell is a great addition to our data infrastructure portfolio and we expect it will contribute strong utility-like cash flows with predictable growth.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Cincinnati Bell owns and operates the leading data transmission and distribution network in Cincinnati, Ohio and Hawaii, with a footprint of over 1.3 million homes, delivering core fiber broadband, video and voice services to residential and enterprise customers. The business is undergoing an industry-leading transformation to upgrade its network to next generation fiber, which will be critical to support the growing demand for data and the advent of 5G. Thus far, Cincinnati Bell has future-proofed 50% of its network, representing more than 17,000 miles of dense metro and last-mile fiber and has plans to further upgrade its network over the next few years. The ongoing fiber upgrade allows Cincinnati Bell to provide utility-like services for broadband and data, generating stable and growing cash flows.  
&gt;  
&gt;Brookfield Infrastructure is a leading global company with a long-standing history as an owner and operator of high-quality infrastructure assets. It has a global portfolio of assets in the utilities, transport, energy and data infrastructure sectors across North and South America, Asia Pacific and Europe.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Transaction is expected to close by the end of 2020. It is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including the approval by Cincinnati Bell’s shareholders, expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and certain regulatory approvals. Cincinnati Bell will file a current report on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission containing a summary of the terms and conditions of the proposed acquisition as well as a copy of the merger agreement."
55,2019-12-23,Wolf_Of_1337_Street,1,Dupont ($DD),"Since the new entity listed in 2017 at $95/share, it has fallen to ~$64. It’s one of the oldest, largest chemical companies in the world, and in the current iteration, DD is the company created in 2019 from the DowDuPont merger &amp; subsequent separations. 

Morningstar has it valued at $95 and lays out a pretty convincing secular bull thesis:


&gt;DuPont's specialty chemicals business is among the best in the world, developing products such as Kevlar and Tyvek that command pricing power and generate healthy profit margins.

&gt;The electronics and imaging business is well positioned to grow profits as a result of growing demand for semiconductors and increased connectivity from 5G and Internet of Things technologies.

&gt;The DowDuPont merger and subsequent separation into three companies created value for shareholders by cutting costs in excess of management's targets, which should improve profit margins over the next several years.

56,2019-12-20,street-guru,1,Street may be too conservative on 5G iPhone estimates,"$AAPL A recent Piper Jaffray survey of 1,090 US iPhone owners indicate nearly 1 in 4 would buy a $1,200 5G iPhone. If analysts are correct in predicting that Apple will also release a sub-$1,000 5G version, demand would be even greater. The last major upgrade cycle was the iPhone 6 Plus, which drove 52% iPhone revenue growth and 37% unit growth in F'15. With the 5G iPhone upgrade cycle poised to be a big one, the Street's current estimate of just 1% iPhone revenue growth for calendar year 2021 seems overly conservative. If iPhone revenue growth proves to be mid-to-high single digits, current valuation multiples (\~20x PE) suggest the shares would trade into $310-$320 range."

Below is a list of the emerging markets that come to my mind. This certainly isn't exhaustive, so input of additional upcoming markets is appreciated.

It will allow the new T-Mobile to be in a better competitive footing against AT&amp;T and Verizon, as well as the ability to stand up a world-class 5G network on par with AT&amp;T and Verizon.

More recently, I’ve just started working full time (less than a year now), so while I have learned a lot in the trading / market / economy arenas I haven’t dabbled too much into the INVESTING (long term, compounding yield, etc). 

With that said, I gotta get good at this 401k game. So what are your best Buy and hold forever names that pay a dividend with decent growth potential? What other investments do you make to get consistent, solid yields? I don’t know anything about bonds (have yet to study up on em) other than its buying debt and the phrase “trillions in negative yielding debt”. What markets do you see becoming massive in the next 10-20 years and now would be a good time to buy in?

My 401k:
Healthcare 25% - it was so beaten up earlier this year I couldn’t not buy in at the lows (owned for a little while now)

MJ 10% - pot etf, bought it at $16.22 because I believe in the weed industry long term and technicals showed possible capitulation on its move down to $16ish so I figured why not dabble, pays ~1% dividend right now (recent buy in) 

GDX 25% - I think the dollar will lose value and I believe gold fundamentally beats fiat currencies ever since the dollar left the gold standard, historical charts would agree. Plus GDX had a massive falling wedge that was rejecting resistance and holding support like clockwork, bought in at $26.60, pays ~1% dividend. (Recent buy in) 

International 40% - I think there will be a capital shift away from the United States markets and back into Europe, decent dividends hoping it will grow. (Been in for not too long but not crazy recent)
