# Description

Skyworks Solutions Inc. designs, develops, manufactures and markets semiconductor products, including intellectual property. The Company's analog semiconductors are used in the automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, industrial, medical, military, smartphone, tablet and wearable markets. Its product portfolio consists of various solutions, including amplifiers, attenuators, detectors, diodes, filters, front-end modules, hybrid, mixers, switches, and modulators. Gawd, that sounds nerdy, doesn't it?

Perhaps, but the client list doesn't :) Arris, Bose, Cisco, Dell, Foxconn, Fujitsu, General Electric, Google, Honeywell, HTC, Huawei, Landis &amp; Gyr, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Nest, Netgear, Northrop Grumman, OPPO, Rockwell Collins, Samsung, Sonos, VIVO, and ZTE. 

Though, it's the theme of ubiquitous wireless &amp; IoT that's probably the most exciting part of this story:

* huge growth is wireless connectivity
* lots of different frequencies and technologies
* a need for seamless handoffs, signal transmission, etc
* more efficient power management
* design challenges with a need for light, small, slimline offerings
* a move from discrete components to customized integrated circuits
* and finally huge demand unfulfilled in emerging markets for smart phone

With that backdrop SWKS highlights

&gt; We are at the forefront of advanced multi-chip module integration and offer unmatched technology breadth, providing deep expertise in CMOS, SOI, GaAs and filters and maintaining strategic partnerships with outside foundries.

Forgive me Nvidia shareholders, but is SWKS the ugly sister / cousin?

## Recent financials 

aside: it's a Sept year end.

Looking at the figures, there's nothing exciting about the top line. Though the change in product mix from regular phones to smart phones is helping to drive higher margins and better earnings. 

|Metric|2016A|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $3.3bn | $3.3bn | $2.3bn | $1.8bn | $1.6bn|
|EPS | $5.18 | $4.10 | $2.38 | $1.45 | $1.05|

Plus they arn't shy about acquiring competitors.

## Competition

They don't paint a rosy picture about the overall market &amp; the competition, but hey, this is the chip industry, so what's new!

&gt; The wireless communications semiconductor industry in general and the other analog markets in which we compete in particular are very competitive. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Maxim Integrated Products, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, QUALCOMM, and Qorvo. We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin and market share. 

Now let's put the narrative to one side and look at margins and returns. Wow... best in class. Even QCOM would be jealous. ;)

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Skyworks Solutions Inc | $3,289M | 42% | 30%
Analog Devices, Inc. | $3,421M | 37% | 17%
Broadcom Ltd | $13,240M | 28% | -14%
Maxim Integrated Products Inc. | $2,194M | 33% | 21%
Microsemi Corporation | $1,655M | 21% | -2%
NXP Semiconductors NV | $8,664M | 20% | 11%
QUALCOMM, Inc. | $23,554M | 35% | 18%
Qorvo Inc | $2,792M | 27% | -1%

## Cash / Debt?

Skyworks Solutions Inc has $1,084M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 7% of the market value of Skyworks Solutions Inc. So management's keeping some powder dry in case a nice little competitor can be snapped up.

In fact they tried to buy PMC Sierra in 2015, only to lose to Microsemi. Though good to see they gave up instead of destroying shareholder value and overpaying.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $86.30 for Skyworks Solutions Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 10% to their target.

# Valuation

When it comes to valuation it's on 13x and that's at the bottom on the sector. Seems a bit weird, given the high margins and good returns. Though the dividend yield is a little disappointing.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/swks.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|

ADI.O | $22,395M | 21x | 7% | 2% | 7%
AVGO.O | $71,698M | 13x | n/a | 2% | 3%
MXIM.O | $11,748M | 21x | 10% | 3% | 8%
MSCC.O | $6,498M | 15x | 17% | 0% | n/a
NXPI.O | $34,040M | 17x | 27% | 0% | 4%
QCOM.O | $98,774M | 14x | 11% | 3% | 10%
QRVO.O | $7,481M | 13x | 15% | 0% | 8%

# Dividends

Skyworks Solutions Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.13 per share, compared with a forecast EPS of $6.13.

And they've bought back circa $1bn of stock over the last 3 years.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 11%. Though frankly, that EPS upgrade is really just the rolling forward to the new fiscal year, with an expectation of sales up to $3.5bn in the coming year, and a tiny bit of margin improvement.

Supposedly the detractors worry they are too exposed to Apple and the iPhone. An Interesting aside is the stock's up 900% in the last 10 years versus Apple up 800% and the darling Nvidia up 400%. Though... the fears are justified. 40% of last years sales were to Foxconn (who work for Apple) and 10% were to Samsung! Ouch. 

So, do I want to invest in a 50% smartphone play 50% other (IoT etc)? At 13x it's bang in line with Apple or Intel. And it's cheaper than a lot of the banks stocks. 

Maybe this is one of those delightful ""boring stock"", that will perform a dream over the long-term... though in terms of an economic moat, I fail to see a particularly strong one. 

Any long-term owners here on reddit?

However it's very likely that there will be new opportunities for very profitable investments that people might not even see yet. People are talking about big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence and are throwing all kinds of buzzwords around saying that they will be the next *big* thing. I think so too.

For AI and self-driving cars there are lots of companies that one can invest in. Big players like Google are likely to have a big impact there. 

However for *huge* returns you will need to spot an emerging super high growth market that not a lot of people see coming yet and a company perfectly suited for it.

How would you go about making bets on such companies? Search through OTC / penny stocks and find something you think looks like a gem and **hold it for a couple of decades** (after you get through all of the scammers first) ? "

&gt; Revenue for cognitive and artificial intelligence systems will hit $12.5 billion in 2017, up 59.3 percent from a year ago, according to IDC. Through 2020, these AI systems will top $46 billion, up 54.4 percent on a compound annual growth rate.

&gt;The biggest portion of that spending in 2017 will go to cognitive applications. IDC projects 2017 spending of $4.5 billion for the year. Cognitive and AI software platforms with tools to organize, access and analyze data will see spending of $2.5 billion.

&gt;Meanwhile, services attached to rolling out cognitive and AI services will top $3.5 billion in 2017, said IDC, which also noted that $1.9 billion will be spent on hardware for these systems.

&gt;As for use cases, quality management and recommendations, diagnosis and treatment, customer service, security and fraud investigations will lead. Those use cases will account for half of all AI system spending in 2017. Between 2015 and 2020, public safety and emergency response and pharmaceutical research and discovery will grow at the fastest clip.

&gt;The U.S. will spend the most--nearly $9.7 billion--on AI in 2017 with EMEA No. 2. By 2020, Asia/Pacific will be No. 2, said IDC.

10,2017-06-09,vegaseller,0,Jdcom-says-plans-to-invest-in-thailand-by-end-of-year,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jd-com-strategy-idUSKBN1901BM

Thailand will come soon, before the end of the year. We will invest a lot and also find the best local partners to work together with. Everyone could be possible, but not Lazada,"" Liu said, referring to the fact that the Southeast Asian online retailer is now controlled by JD.com's largest domestic rival Alibaba Group.

Liu said he was confident his firm could compete with Alibaba in that market and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.            

""When we entered the e-commerce business 12 years ago ... Alibaba was already a giant. It couldn't kill us. How can it do so today?"" Liu told Reuters.             

""Unless we make some serious strategic mistake, no competitors can actually beat us nowadays.""

But he declined to say how much JD.com would invest in Thailand, though said it was likely to be less than he was investing in Indonesia, which accounts for almost all its current business outside China.             

Amid intense competition, JD.com has expanded into fast-moving consumer goods, including household supplies, food and drink. The company has also diversified into data, cloud and artificial intelligence services.          

In May the firm posted its first quarterly profit since its share listing in 2014, as an expanded product line-up attracted more active users, but also cautioned the cost of expanding at home and abroad could crimp profits growth.      

It made a first-quarter net profit of 355.7 million yuan on revenue up 41 percent at 76.2 billion yuan ($11.21 billion), while active customer accounts total more than 237 million.

Liu also said the firm was pressing ahead with its adoption of drones to deliver goods between cities and remoter areas including sourcing agricultural and wild produce in the southwestern province of Sichuan, and adjoining Shaanxi province.        

He said JD planned to build 180 so-called drone network ""airports"" in the mountainous Sichuan region where vehicle deliveries would cost more and take much longer. Each of these drone launch pads would likely cost around 600,000 yuan he said.

Is it worth the digging?

# 1. Looking at the chips

Applied Materials provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the  semiconductor, display and related industries. So it's an interesting play of the technology business. They aren't the chip maker, or the person who sells the chips inside the phones. They are the folks that make the equipment that makes the chips. Tangential eh?

They've 4 divisions, but the Semis biz is the key, both it terms of sell kit and supporting clients.

1. Semiconductor Systems, 60% of sales, where they sell their kit
2. Global Services, just over 20% of sales, where they are supporting and upselling to the existing clients
3. Display and Adjacent Markets, just under 20%, which is their LCD screen equipment, etc
4. the Corporate and Other segment, which includes solar cells etc, though this is less than 2% of sales.

Of course, you won't be surprised that 85% of sales are in Asia. and just 10% in the US, and the rest in Europe. With TSMC in Taiwan making up over 15% of sales. Samsung, Micron and Intel over 10% each. Imagine, their top 4 clients are 51% of sales. 

Looking at revenues and profits, it's been beautiful the last three years! And looking at the forecasts for the year to October 2017, it's expected to get wildly better.

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|2017E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

|DPS | $0.35 | $0.39 | $0.40 | $0.40 | $0.40 |$0.41|

Though for some strange reason, this isn't filtering through to an increased dividends :( Well, I suppose we shouldn't complain, they did $2bn of buybacks, versus $450m of dividend payments. Though with all that cash-flow pumping, it's hardly a surprise that they are in a net cash position.

# 2. Better Picks 'n' Shovels

When it comes to the peers, everyone's got a specialty, an edge. But clearly AMAT's at the more commodity end of the business model. And if we look at their big clients, we can see they aren't more profitable than their customers.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|

Intel Corporation | $60,481M | 39% | 18%

And how does this filter thro' to valuation? It doesn't. Margins seem to be irrelevant to the valuation. Growth rates seem to be irrelevant. Dividends too! 

Though, there's ASML, which is in an oligopoly position (lithography a story in its own right), and there's the rest.

# 3. Love boring?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $50 target for $AMAT which is a 20% upside. So no wonder their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. And the stock trading at 13x is at the lower end of it's 12 to 18x forecast earnings range. And they typically beat earnings by a cent or two every quarter!

Though as bullish as Wall Street is, they've not drunk the Kool-Aid as management have:

&gt; Today, many new demand drivers are emerging that layer on top of traditional computing and mobility, technologies like the Internet of Things, big data and artificial intelligence are transforming industries, including transportation, health care, entertainment and manufacturing. The way these industries create value is increasingly dependent on capturing, transmitting, understanding and storing data. In turn, this means they are more and more reliant on advanced semiconductors. 

# 4. Rising tide?

Management talks about the industry's growth being sustainable and the position of AMAT being sustainable. So a rising tide is lifting all boats? Especially AMAT? Sitting on a 3 bagger in 2 years, ""long-term shareholders"" gotta be happy, but do I jump now in now? 

All the fundamentals look good, the valuation looks reasonable, so it's hard to argue with the bulls! Sure, you can worry about China every now and again, or spot a weak quarter, but does that stop the rising tide? Doubt it.

But if you do buy, watch the industry like a seasoned mariner. The tide always turns. The Semi business gets nasty quickly, sales can plummet, plunging the leaders into lose. And maybe that explains the low single digit valuations, and low dividend payout ratios... anyone with more than a 5 year memory, has seen Semi ships flounder before.

13,2017-08-30,vegaseller,7,"In an unusual partnership, Amazon and Microsoft are working together to extend the abilities of their voice-controlled digital assistants.","https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/technology/amazon-alexa-microsoft-cortana.html

In an interview last Friday at one of Amazon’s Seattle high-rises, Mr. Bezos predicted that over time people would turn to different digital assistants — also called “A.I.s,” for artificial intelligence — the same way they turn to one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations.

“I want them to have access to as many of those A.I.s as possible.” Mr. Bezos said.

As an example, Mr. Bezos cited Cortana's superior integration with Outlook, the popular calendar and email application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of software. Because Microsoft controls both products, Outlook is integrated more deeply with Cortana than with other voice assistants. Through its collaboration with Microsoft, Amazon said, Alexa users will get answers to some of the same questions that Cortana can now answer — for instance, when is the next budget review with the boss?

Initially, getting the two systems to work together is going to be a little awkward. Someone working with an Alexa device will have to say “Alexa, Open Cortana” followed by their command, while someone starting with a Cortana machine will have to say “Cortana, Open Alexa.”

The Amazon-Microsoft partnership started in May 2016, when Mr. Bezos raised the idea with Mr. Nadella at Microsoft’s CEO Summit, an annual event for business leaders in the Seattle area. Mr. Nadella was receptive to the idea, so a short while later Mr. Bezos emailed a draft of a brief news release that described how their assistants would work together, both men said.

It is standard at Amazon to create such news releases for internal consumption as part of what Mr. Bezos calls the company’s “working backward process.” Through that exercise, Amazon’s teams depict in writing how a new product or service will look to its customers before engineers write a line of code.

Mr. Bezos said he had not reached out to Apple or Google to invite them to join in the effort and does not know if they would want to.

“I’d welcome it,” he said.

“Hopefully, they’ll be inspired by it,” Mr. Nadella said. “At least that would be my hope.”

An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Google spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.

Apple and Google may see competitive advantages in keeping their A.I.s separate from rival assistants, partly as a way to protect a selling point of their mobile software, iOS and Android. Apple is especially finnicky about wanting to control as much as it can of people’s experiences with its iPhones and iPads."

# 1. Are you into robots... boring ones?

It turns out that robots are boring. Car plant assembly lines, toy dogs and vacuum cleaners. Phew, no SciFi here.

Though the actual technology inside an iRobit is _cool_: mapping, navigation, mobility and artificial intelligence. But the thing you buy is a vacuum; mop; or pool cleaner!

And what's really exciting, is that like Apple and iPhone's there aren't a lot of alternatives, Dyson is the only real one. 

That leading dynamic could be sustained, as they spend heavily on R&amp;D and defend their patents across the globe.

&gt; As of December 31, 2016, we held 368 U.S. patents, more than 550 foreign patents, additional design registrations, and more than 400 patent applications pending worldwide. Our U.S. patents will begin to expire in 2019. 

## Moving nicely at the top

There's been a healthy increase in the topline, though it's not a high margin business, with an operating profit of $58m on $661m of sales. 

The US is about 50% of all sales, and over 70% of sales are via their 15 largest retailer / distribution partners.

|Metric|2012A|2013A|2014A|2015A|2016A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $436m | $487m | $557m | $617m | $661m|
|EPS | $0.61 | $0.94 | $1.25 | $1.47 | $1.48|

But in recent years, IRBT has seen it's gross margin decline and increased it's investment in brand. If we look at the forecasts for 2017 and 18, these investments look like they will pay off at the top line... not the bottom. In fact a considerable part of that jump in sales may be because they are buying some of their distributors. 

|Metric|2016A|2017E|2018E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $661m | $852m | $980m | 
|EPS | $1.48 | $1.58 | $2.63 |

And like other ""gadget"" stocks (dare I say Fitbit or GoPro) the 4th quarter is a big deal. What? People buy these as presents? 

## Investment mode?

With $260m of net cash on the books, perhaps IRBT is in investment mode. Furthermore, they don't pay a dividend. But did buy back circa $100m of stock last year as their cash balance has ramped to over 10% of their market value.

# 2. How do they compare?

Dyson isn't listed, and there' no ""robotics"" peers of any size, so let's look at consumer appliance and related products. On this front IRBT doesn't stand out as best in class. Though that's nothing to worry about.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
iRobot Corporation | $733M | 12% | 15%
Newell Brands Inc | $15,411M | 14% | 10%
Whirlpool Corporation | $21,037M | 10% | 16%
Electrolux AB (ADR) | $15,342M | 8% | 28%
Middleby Corp | $2,281M | 23% | 22%
Tupperware Brands Corporation | $2,250M | 18% | 76%

It's when we get to valuation that I start to worry.

Peers|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
IRBT.O | $2,041M | 46x | N/A | 0% | 4%
NWL | $20,075M | 14x | 10% | 2% | 11%
WHR | $12,939M | 12x | 12% | 2% | 13%
ELUXY.PK | $10,932M | 17x | N/A | 3% | 14%
ELUXB.ST | $87,259M | 16x | 9% | 3% | 13%
MIDD.O | $7,013M | 22x | 8% | 0% | 5%
TUP | $3,056M | 13x | 12% | 5% | 12%

I'm struggling to understand why it's worth over twice the earnings multiple of the most valuable peer. Especially with most peers on double digit earnings growth.

Okay the current 46 times earnings is midway between the two year range of 19 to 64 times earnings... but what justified this stellar valuation jump? I don't get it.

Sure the company has beaten forecasts for the last three years, quarter in quarter out, but the management teams' outlook in August failed to impress and the forecasts for 2017 got slashed. Though maybe that was their recent deal to buy their largest European distributor.

Maybe the brokers still aren't looking at their 2018 figures, and $2.63 a share might be a little _blue sky_. Though, management talked about a $1.80 to $2.00 a share for 2017, pre-acquisition expenses.

# 3. And Wall Street says? 

And although Wall Street's target price is anchored at $90, a healthy 20% above the current price, they say _""Hold""_.

In fact, Wall Street has called this one nicely... saying Buy, Buy, Buy all the way to May this year. Cutting to a Hold when the stock broke thro' the $100 mark.

# 4. One for the pre-Christmas list?

I don't get the valuation, but I can see why sentiment can drive the stock up in the Christmas quarter. 

In fact, look at the quarterly high the last 2 years...

|Quarter High|Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Q4 v Q3|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|2016 | $36 | $39 | $45 | $61 | +36%|
|2015 | $35 | $35 | $33 | $38 | +13%|

The Christmas quarters have been good to investors in 2015 and 2016, even if they bought at the high the previous quarter. Though this pattern was not the case in 2014 or 2013.

I'm not a momentum guy, even if there is a ""Black Friday"" trade to have. And with technicals driving the stock down at the moment, it feels like there could be a cheaper entry price coming.

Yes a great product, but I'm getting sticker shock when I see the price. Am keeping my mop and brush for now. ;)

Bodega may not have to pay rent for physical stores or employ store workers. But Bodega doesn't eliminate the complicated costly logistics of a convenience store or a vending machine.  

""Just like a vending machine or a store chain, Bodega staff or contractors will still need to buy a bunch of products and drive to stock them in many different locations. Maybe -- maybe! -- AI software can tailor inventory to each location, but it will be many many years before robots can pick up cans, chip bags and little Advil boxes, walk them into an office or store, unlock the Bodega cabinets and place the items on shelves.""

&gt;The fund, which is being run in partnership with ETF Managers Group of Summit, New Jersey, will use AI and machine learning to scan more than 6,000 U.S. publicly traded companies each day to create a diversified fund, Amador said. The program will parse regulatory filings, more than a million news stories, company management profiles, sentiment gauges and financial models to establish a portfolio of 30 to 70 stocks.  

&gt;Once the stocks are chosen, a team of human managers at ETF Managers Group will rebalance the portfolio based on the selections -- theoretically, every day if the computer proposes changes.   

Just launched yesterday.  AI powered by IBM's Watson.  Will be really interesting to see which companies the AI chooses and how it competes/compares to other ETFs.

What's your take on the ETFs available within AI? Have you found any other ETFs within this sector that might be interesting?
