Martin Wolf JANUARY 1, 2019 

Do not extrapolate from the recent past. China has had a hugely impressive four decades. After their triumph in the cold war, both the west and the cause of liberal democracy have stumbled. Should we conclude that an autocratic China is sure to become the world’s dominant power in the next few decades? My answer is: no. That is a possible future, not a certain one.

The view widely held in the 1980s that Japan would be “number one” turned out to be badly mistaken. In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev, then first secretary of the Communist party of the Soviet Union, told the west that “We will bury you!” He proved utterly wrong. The examples of Japan and the Soviet Union highlight three frequent mistakes: extrapolating from the recent past; assuming that a period of rapid economic growth will be indefinitely sustained; and exaggerating the benefits of centralised direction over those of economic and political competition. In the long run, the former is likely to become rigid and so brittle, while the latter is likely to display flexibility and so self-renewal.

Today, the fiercest political and economic competition is between China and the US. A conventional view is that by, say, 2040, China’s economy will be far bigger than that of the US, with India far smaller still. But might this view be mistaken? Capital Economics, an independent research firm, answers “yes”, arguing that China's period of stellar outperformance might be coming to an end quite soon. (See charts.)


There are two powerful arguments why this view will prove to be mistaken: first, China has great potential for continuing catch-up on the productivity levels of the most advanced countries; and, second, it has a proven ability to generate sustained rapid growth. It is brave to bet against both potential and capacity. But, argues Capital Economics, in its “Long-Term Global Economic Outlook”, we should. As with Japan in the 1980s, the policies of ultra-high investment and rapid debt accumulation, which kept China growing so fast after the 2008 financial crisis, make it vulnerable to a sharp deceleration.


Crucially, China’s investment rate, at 44 per cent of gross domestic product in 2017, is unsustainably high. This extraordinary investment rate did maintain the growth of supply and demand after the 2008 crisis. But China’s public capital stock per head is already far bigger than Japan’s at comparable incomes per head. Slowing urban household formation means that fewer new homes now need to be built. Not surprisingly, returns on investment have collapsed. In sum, investment-led growth must come to an early end.

Because of its size, China has also hit the buffers on export-driven growth, at a lower level of income per head than other high-growth east Asian economies. The trade war with the US underlines this reality. China’s working-age population is also declining. Given the huge rise in debt as well, sustaining fast growth will be very hard.


Future demand will depend on the emergence of a mass-consumer market, while growth of supply will require an upsurge in growth of “total factor productivity” — a measure of innovation. Yet, in 2017, private consumption was only 39 per cent of GDP. If it is to drive demand, the savings rate must tumble and the share of household incomes in GDP must jump. Neither will be easy to achieve. But the biggest hurdle of all, especially to the needed upsurge in productivity growth, is the shift towards a more autocratic political system.

For one and a half decades, China has benefited from the reforms introduced by Zhu Rongji, premier from 1998 to 2003. No comparable reforms have happened since his time. Today, credit is still being preferentially allocated to state businesses, while state influence over large private businesses is growing. All this is likely to distort the allocation of resources and slow the rate of innovation and economic progress, even if an outright financial crisis is avoided.

In sum, China may well fail to replicate the success of other east Asian high-growth economies, in becoming a high-income country in short order. It will surely be far harder for it to do so, because the distortions in its economy are so large and the global environment is going to be so much more hostile.


Meanwhile, suggests Capital Economics, the arrival of robotics and artificial intelligence might re-ignite productivity growth in the west and, above all, in the US. If one wished to be optimistic, one would also hope that experience of Donald Trump’s incompetence and malevolence will be salutary. His hardcore supporters are a minority. Majorities of the disgusted should win and then bring about the renewal of economic competition and social concern that the US needs.

The most interesting other economy is not Europe, which seems destined for a slow relative decline, but India, due to be the world’s most populous country in the near future. India is far poorer than China and so still has great potential for fast catch-up growth. Capital Economics forecasts 5-7 per cent annual growth until 2040. This is at least conceivable. India’s savings rates and entrepreneurial capacity are high enough to deliver such a rate. It will need much policy reform. But India’s politics are increasingly focused on economic performance. This does not guarantee success. But it does make it more likely.

Disheartened liberal democrats must not despair. The euphoria and hubris of the “unipolar moment” of the 1990s and early 2000s were grave mistakes. But the triumph of despotism is still far from inevitable. Autocracies can fail, just as democracies can thrive. China confronts huge economic challenges. Meanwhile, democracies must learn from their mistakes and focus on renewing their politics and policies.

7,2019-02-14,ladybaybee,1,Ladybaybee's recommended stock picks for 2-14-2019,"[Link to imgur with a screenshot of my picks for the day](https://imgur.com/a/T09c9Yg)

I am not a financier or economist. I am electrical engineer with equal passion in artificial intelligence and financial markets. For the past 2 years I have been working on a system that would make short term predictions of stocks. The system is rather complex, I use multiple layers which include: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs and Genetic Algorithms. All bulked together produce an output like in this image. The way to interpret the image is a follows: Symbol and Date columns are self explanatory, Quorum refers to autonomous agents that decide whether to BUY/NOT BUY or SELL/HOLD a stock. Each symbol has 9 agents, and the Quorum column, counts the number of agents that recommend Buy, Selling or Holding the stock. The “Not Owned” column means: if you don’t own this  stock then you should The “Owned” column means: if you own this stock you should HOLD or SELL. The column “Growth(90d)” refers to what what has been the growth of this system of Agents in the past 3 months. The column “Tx(90d)” shows the number of full transactions that these agents recommended in the last 3 months. “Factor” is just the division of Growth divided by Transactions to get the average growth per transaction. Finally “Success Rate” shows how successful these agents have been in their recommendations in the past 90 days, success 1 means 100% successful, 0.5 means 50% successful, and so on. 

Many people have been curious about the actual process that the system follows, so here it is: for every symbol (600 stocks are analyzed daily), we get the full stock data (open,close,high,low,volume) for the past 4 months. Each stock is associated with another set of “lookalike” stocks as well as major ETF’s. This initial dataset is run through a convolutional layer that extracts an undisclosed number of features. These features are then passed onto a recurrent neural network (LSTM) where sequences and patterns are extracted. The LSTM then spits out probabilities for the likelihood that this stock will have a positive, negative and neutral tendency in the next N days. These probabilities are then fed to a genetic evolution system (GES). This system essentially checks the predictions for the past N days and compares them with reality, following that the systems knows which predictions are performing the best. Once the system knows which stocks are being simulated the best, then the system automatically finds which of these best performing stocks have the biggest potential for the next few days. The system does not output explanations, unfortunately us humans are not capable of understanding (or visualizing) a problem of this dimensionality, for example the LSTM part alone works with over 10 million dimensions, not features but dimensions."

&gt; 
&gt; 	Two-fifths of Europe’s artificial intelligence start-ups do not use any AI programs in their products, according to a report that highlights the hype around the technology.
&gt; 
&gt; The research by London-based investment firm MMC Ventures could not find any evidence, based on public information and interviews with executives, of artificial intelligence applications at 40 per cent of 2,830 AI start-ups in Europe.
&gt; 
&gt; Nevertheless, the companies are often described as AI-focused, said David Kelnar, MMC’s head of research, who added that many start-ups had plans to develop machine-learning programs, an application of AI that sees computers automatically learn and improve from experience, in the future.
&gt; 
&gt; Almost 8 per cent of European start-ups founded last year were AI companies, compared with about 3 per cent in 2015, MMC’s research showed, with the UK taking the lead. The UK has been home to some of the most high-profile AI businesses, which have been bought by foreign buyers, such as Google’s DeepMind, Microsoft’s SwiftKey and Twitter’s Magic Pony.

&gt;However, investors said the industry would have to cut through a growing frenzy around the sector. “Getting stuck in buzzwords is never a good thing,” said Simon Cook, chief executive of Draper Esprit. “AI has become a catch-all phrase that’s often used flippantly.”

12,2019-05-29,S-PRO_company,1,How to Get Rich by Investing Money in the Most Profitable Businesses,"People are always looking for ways to invest their money smart. Aren’t you one of those? Either way, you wouldn’t be on this page wondering how to get really rich with your own business. No worries, here you’ll realize what things you can do with the money amount already available in your pocket.

We’ve already seen in [our article](https://blog.s-pro.io/invest-money-business-become-millionaire/) what options are there for you when your goal is to earn some interest. Even more, those methods over time can bring really inspiring results for everyone. [In this piece of work](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-invest-money-business/), I've concentrated more on the last specified option – business. There are many reasons for that. Probably the most important one is that business can bring the biggest revenue out of all other investment options.

## What are the most profitable businesses?

There are uncountable possibilities in every niche. Just check out the empty cells in the Startup Matrix we already described in [our post](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-brainstorm-new-startup-ideas-the-startup-idea-matrix/). We can start listing the actual spheres that are in need of fresh new ideas. But to be of more help to you we better concentrate on the directions in businesses that can be applied to almost every business niche.

What unites every other direction is technology. It has already changed the way all businesses function around the world. There more or less progress here or there, but it is definitely the biggest trend nowadays.

Entrepreneurs are stepping into the tech world with joy because it has already proven the positive effect that tech inclusions do with businesses by scaling them with ease.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning will take away manual operations transforming the way industries will work within just a few years.

### Online business

People are getting more aware of the benefits of online transactions, communication systems and other online platforms offer. Have you considered how much more convenient it is to use contactless payments?

There were many challenges that online businesses have already overcome and continue successfully dealing with nowadays.

### Artificial Intelligence

There have been many debates around AI for years. Nowadays it gets more and more popular and is expected to bring new products with [AI implemented](https://blog.s-pro.io/ai-driven-development-as-an-innovative-market-tendency/) in 2019 and further years.

With AI data analytics will be on hype as artificial intelligence operates with behavioral data of each user.

### Blockchain

Even though the hype around blockchain has been decreased lately, it still has great potential in [transforming all the business niches and everyone’s lives](https://blog.s-pro.io/how-to-change-the-world-for-the-better-or-our-utopian-future-with-blockchain/). Due to its benefits where the major ones are anonymity, security and interchangeability it has already been implemented in a number of big projects and continues to be in demand.

These are just a few major trends that will rule the business world and continue to be implemented in all areas of our lives. The core feature that unites all of them is an online presence. The mobility it gives to consumers is much appreciated by them. People are getting to feel the benefits of not be tied up to a certain location.

What comes to your mind when you think about mobility? Possibly mobile devices and the growing number of various mobile applications already implemented and growing. The thing is all the mentioned trends can be implemented in businesses via web and mobile applications.

Hey guys, my colleagues and I have worked on a neural network model that predicts if a loan is a good buy.

We have background in the finance industry (me personally is ex - Goldman Sachs). With the current break through in artificial intelligence, our goal is to eventually build out an auto invest service utilizing this technology. We've been testing our model 2 years ago and our avg annual return is about 13% (compounded).

That being said, I would appreciate feedback from the community on what we've been building so far. So we've released a google chrome extension that have access to the core AI model (without the auto invest service).

The approach is using over 70 variables and indicators (both macro and micro) to optimize and pick out loans with maximum return while having the lowest risks. (Think 70 dimension efficiency frontier curve which is only possible with AI given computer resource limitations). Any feedback is much appreciated.

**SHORT:**

**Veritone (VERI)**

*Today's price $7.70 Today's movement -5.75% Market Cap (Yahoo Finance) $156.6M*

**Summary:** Veritone markets itself as an AI software company, but can be viewed more as a SAAS company. They provide services to M&amp;E (Media &amp; Entertainment), Government, and Legal &amp; Compliance. The AI component of their software comes from facial and item recognition. For instance, its AI can learn what a customer logo looks like and then show how many impressions of the logo appears in a video. Its AI can also, recognize a face in a surveillance video and identify the suspect.

Veritone can help its customers cut expenses via labor hours and provide a revenue stream because its AI edits videos. For M&amp;E, companies can charge customers the ability to find clips of a specific person in their content (for example an athlete in a sports event). In government, man-hours are saved because an official does not have to watch the whole surveillance video. The portion of the video without the perpetrator will be edited out.

I believe there is great value in Veritone's software, but I don't believe in Veritone's run rate. Veritone reminds me of another company, HMNY (owner of Moviepass). HMNY's stock like Veritone's skyrocketed in the beginning because of FOMO investors and large fanfare. HMNY was bleeding cash and sold equity to become cash positive. HMNY stock price suffered because of this. HMNY's stock price went so low it did a 1 for 250 reverse stock-split so it could continue to be listed on Nasdaq and raise cash at a higher stock price. HMNY's stock is now a penny stock.

I recommend short Veritone until it can prove to be cash flow positive from operations. Veritone can become cash flow positive because of tailwinds like new legislation in California, Ohio, and many other states forcing law enforcement to disclose a redacted version of their audio and video-based evidence on a far more rapid timeline. Until then, the cash burn and dilution will cause the share price to slide once again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalysts for Short**:

**1.** **Veritone will continue to issue common stock to be cash flow positive and dilute investors.**

Q4 2018 Shares outstanding was 19,335,220.

Veritone issued 662,000 common stock in Q1 2019 (3.4%)

Q1 2019 Shares outstanding was 20,197,188.

**2**. **Additional dilution, such as Acacia Research has 1.1 million warrants priced at $13.61 and acquisitions are being funded partially by equity.**

The warrants are not in the money yet. If Veritone's stock price does increase, Acacia will dilute current investors even further.

Veritone acquired three companies this past year. More information can be read in ""Recent Acquisitions"" far below.

**3. Not enough revenue growth to offset net loss**

Revenue was $12.1M, an increase of 177% vs Q1 2018. This according to the earnings call happened from acquisitions and organic growth. The acquisitions caused SG&amp;A to increase more too so the net loss was (16,306) vs (13,047) in Q1 2018.

**Catalysts for Potential Long:**

**2. Revenue growth opportunity with new legislation in California, Ohio, and other states**

Aforementioned, new legislation will force law enforcement to disclose a redacted version of their audio and video-based evidence on a far more rapid timeline. Veritone is primed to serve this market.

**3. Insider buying, strong management, and a strong board of directors**

CEO Chad Steelberg ($7.54/share), President Ryan Steelberg ($7.49/share), and Board Member Richard H. Taketa ($7.49/share) bought shares within the last month

&amp;#x200B;

**Catalyst for Long or Short (depending on outlook):**

**1. Rejected Apis Capital hostile takeover bid**

In December 2018, Apis Capital offered to acquire Veritone at $10.26/share, an 82% premium at that time. Apis Capital subsequently withdrew its bid. This can be viewed as management's competence or incompetence.

**Competent**

Management was competent and believed the 82% premium was too small. Management believes the share price can be above $10.26/share soon.

**Incompetent**

Management was incompetent and did not look out for shareholders as the stock price is well below that today.

**Recent Acquisitions (From 10-Q):**

**Acquired Performance Bridge (8.21.18)**

Veritone paid initial consideration of $5,158 and will pay a total of $3,909 in additional contingent earnout amounts for certain revenue milestones achieved by Performance Bridge in its 2018 fiscal year. The acquisition of Performance Bridge has expanded the Company’s media agency offerings of comprehensive podcast solutions.

**Acquired Wazee Digital (8.31.18)**

Veritone paid an aggregate purchase price of $12,552, comprised of $7,423 paid in cash and the issuance of a total of 491,157 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $5,129 based on the Company’s closing stock price on August 31, 2018.

The acquisition of Wazee Digital has expanded the Company’s offerings to include digital content management and licensing solutions.

**Acquired Machine Box (9.6.18)**

Veritone paid initial consideration of $1,484, and the Company may pay up to an additional $3,000 in contingent amounts if Machine Box achieves certain technical development and integration milestones within 12 months after the closing of the acquisition, a portion of which was paid in the first quarter of 2019.

In March 2019, the Company determined that Machine Box had achieved the technical development and integration milestones required to be completed as of March 6, 2019 and, as a result, the former Machine Box stockholders became entitled to receive an aggregate of $200 in cash and an aggregate of 135,583 shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $880 based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on March 6, 2019.

In the biggest-ever takeover in the luxury-goods industry, lvmh, a French global conglomerate, announced its acquisition of **Tiffany**, an American jeweller founded in 1837 and known for its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York. lvmh is paying $16.9bn, more than the roughly $14.5bn that was suggested when the transaction was first mooted in late October. The deal represents a success for Bernard Arnault, lvmh’s boss and controlling shareholder, who had courted Tiffany for some time. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/lvmh-tests-the-limits-of-luxury).

## The magic trick

The flotation of **Alibaba’s** shares on the Hong Kong stockmarket raised $11.2bn, making it the most valuable share offering this year, ahead of the $8.1bn that Uber raked in at its ipo in May. The stock rose by 6.6% on the first day of trading in what is a secondary listing in Alibaba. Its shares are also listed in New York. See [article](https://www.economist.com/node/21775688).

**Uber** lost its licence to operate in London, again. The ride-hailing company has 45,000 drivers in the city, one of its biggest markets. London’s transport regulator raised more concerns about safety, including 14,000 fraudulent trips by unauthorised drivers. Uber is appealing against the decision and can continue to operate while it does so. See [article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/11/27/london-hits-uber-hard-and-hails-a-fleet-of-new-cheaper-apps).

The chief executive of **Westpac** resigned and the chairman said he would step down next year, as Australia’s second-largest bank faced mounting criticism about its response to a money-laundering scandal. A regulator has accused Westpac of failing to monitor more than 23m suspect transactions, some of which enabled child exploitation in the Philippines. The bank has found itself in politicians’ cross-hairs. Australia’s treasurer said it had been indifferent to the scandal; the attorney-general noted that it was an “unbelievably serious” matter. Westpac has reportedly cancelled its Christmas party.

**Charles Schwab**, America’s biggest discount broker, struck a $26bn deal to acquire **td** **Ameritrade**, a rival. The pair had recently been engaged in a price war, both ditching the transaction fees they charged customers. The combined group will have around $5trn in client assets. See [article](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/11/30/charles-schwab-agrees-to-buy-td-ameritrade-for-26bn).

The **Brazilian real** fell to a new low against the dollar, after Brazil’s finance minister said he was “not worried” about a strong greenback. The slide prompted a brief intervention by the central bank to prop up the currency. The country’s current-account deficit has risen sharply this year, and interest rates have tumbled.

**Google** reportedly fired four employees who had been active in organising protests at the company and had apparently tried to gain access to private internal documents. The tech giant pioneered an office culture that mixes politics with work, which it may now regret. Vociferous staff have pressed management to drop an ai contract for the Pentagon and have walked out over sexual harassment and a search-engine project for the Chinese government. Their latest gripe is Google’s work for immigration enforcement. Google has told employees to tone it down and reduced staff meetings to one a month.

In an effort to boost profits and its feeble share price, **Telefónica** announced a plan to hive off its operations in Spanish-speaking Latin America and focus on its core markets in Spain, Brazil, Germany and Britain, where it brands itself as O2. The telecoms group also wants to expand its business in the internet of things and cloud computing.

On the lookout for new superdrugs that will replenish its portfolio, **Novartis** offered to buy **The Medicines Company** for $9.7bn. tmc’s crown jewel is inclisiran, a treatment that has been found to be highly effective in drug trials at reducing “bad” cholesterol, and which a patient needs to inject only twice a year. See [article](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/11/30/the-reinvention-of-novartis).

America’s Federal Aviation Administration said it alone would inspect the **737** max before it is returned to service, relieving Boeing of the exercise and signalling that it will sign off each jet individually. That could potentially extend the time frame that Boeing has in mind for resuming deliveries of the grounded aircraft to airlines.

**Tesla’s** share price struggled to recover from the drubbing it took after an unforeseen event at the launch of its new Cybertruck, which has been described as a cross between a futuristic car from “Blade Runner” and a SpongeBob SquarePants character. The vehicle’s supposedly armoured-glass windows shattered when a steel ball was hurled at them during a demonstration. “Maybe that was a little too hard,” said a startled Elon Musk, Tesla’s boss.

Lee Sedol, a Go champion, who in 2016 lost a celebrated match against AlphaGo, an **artificial-intelligence** program, announced his retirement. ai programs now compete in tournaments. Mr Lee reflected: “Even if I become number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated.”"
22,2019-11-26,davidtorre15,1,I think I've found a good source of income.," 

I am a librarian at one of the best universities in my country, The Central University of Venezuela, and due to my nationality it has been difficult for me to find an investor. I have applied my knowledge in the crypto market and have found a possible great source of income. There are different types of cryptos with capitalizations from millions to billions of dollars and each crypto is supported by different projects such as ecological, security, artificial intelligence among others. It should be added that although there are thousands of cryptos, each has the same need, The Adoption of cryptocurrencies in society, being this the project that will support our crypto.

All companies spend thousands to millions of dollars either in research, advertising, market research or marketing to continually discover how to achieve the continued adoption of their product or service by the consumer. Certainly not all companies achieve massive-effective adoption, being the crypt market the one that has presented more problems in its adoption. It should be added that the project that has as objective the adoption crypto in an effective way and presents the best research, market study, marketing strategy, concrete results, among others, could be one of the projects-crypto, better supported financially by the market.

We have evaluated various forms of adoption raised by companies carrying out events, advertising and we have also evaluated projects that have sought crypto adoption with less scope and although there are different ways to take adoption, are not having the results they want. Example the project eletropay that were going to get a financing from shark tank Brazil for almost $1,000,000. The funding was never given for lack of diligence in the paperwork and according to one of the spokespersons of the company DASH who spoke about his method for adoption through the use of a product such as the POS (Point of Sale) stating that it was not the most efficient.

I have been looking for an investor in other countries for almost a year and due to my nationality I have not been able to get an investor. I have contacted with a Venezuelan company AFX Exchange and when they presented my project they affirmed that it is a new form of adoption but also because it is something new, they do not know how good it can be. I have received good comments from connoisseurs in crypto currencies recognizing that the project I propose could be effective but unfortunately we will not know how good it is, until the moment we bring this to market. The cryptomedas in their pre-sale collect millions of dollars as you see in the image, certainly some raise less money, as well as other crypto collect $10,000,000, $20,000,000 and much more money than what you see in the photos, it all depends on the importance that the market gives to the project.

We offer project equity for funding. It takes about $8,000 to $10,000. From the day we get the investment, in about a month and a half we will pre-sell our crypto. Being the first profit taking on the part of the investor and those involved in the project.

I am aware of the bad publicity they give to Venezuelans, but I also know that the type of project I propose could generate a lot of income since the market for cryptom moves billions of dollars (data verifiable in coinmarketcap). If we do not generate the necessary trust, we are in the possibility of meeting with the investor personally if he resides in Colombia or Venezuela where our team is located"

Judging by the fundamentals of Netflix, they are unquestionable a 'growth' stock still. There are plenty untapped subscribers throughout the world. The problem isn't reaching them; that's inevitable. The **problem is the cost** in doing so.

Ultimately, Netflix will have to find creative ways to discount their production costs and compete with the 'still popular' cable services and network movies sought as a luxury in many countries around the world.

They can pull it off, but the cost of broadcasting on a platform that **forever needs to regenerate content** to keep the passengers aboard ship and invite new ones is a growing threat against cash flow to firm. Eventually, we will see this reflected in the free cash flow to \*equity\*, which we often don't get a clear image of since debt incurrence adds back to the free cash flow of equity investors.

I expect a deeper investment on Artificial Intelligence to content-match with specific users in order to keep them engaged.

I've made a proof of work in top link, and I'd genuinely like to hear any dissenting beliefs willing to counter or even add to my points.  To be frank, I've never worked for an investment institution nor do I want to pretend to be an expert. My day job is in building erosion and drainage infrastructure.

24,2019-11-11,beck2047,1,Google’s ‘Project Nightingale’ Gathers Personal Health Data on Millions of Americans,"[https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790?mod=hp_lead_pos1) 

Google is engaged with one of the country’s largest health-care systems to collect and crunch the detailed personal health information of millions of Americans across 21 states.

The initiative, code-named “Project Nightingale,” appears to be the largest in a series of efforts by Silicon Valley giants to gain access to personal health data and establish a toehold in the massive health-care industry. [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also aggressively pushing into health care, though they haven’t yet struck deals of this scope.

Google began the effort in secret last year with St. Louis-based Ascension, the second-largest health system in the U.S., with the data sharing accelerating since summer, the documents show.

The data involved in Project Nightingale encompasses lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, including patient names and dates of birth.

Neither patients nor doctors have been notified. At least 150 Google employees already have access to much of the data on tens of millions of patients, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents.

Some Ascension employees have raised questions about the way the data is being collected and shared, both from a technological and ethical perspective, according to the people familiar with the project. But privacy experts said it appeared to be permissible under federal law. That law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, generally allows hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used “only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions.”

Google in this case is using the data, in part, to design new software, underpinned by advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, that zeroes in on individual patients to suggest changes to their care. Staffers across Alphabet Inc., Google’s parent, have access to the patient information, documents show, including some employees of Google Brain, a research science division credited with some of the company’s biggest breakthroughs.

In a press release issued after the Journal’s article was published, the companies said the project is compliant with federal health law and includes robust protections for patient data.

Tech giants like Amazon and Apple are expanding their businesses to include electronic health records -- which contain data on diagnoses, prescriptions and other medical information. That’s creating both opportunities and spurring privacy concerns. Here’s what to know. Photo Composite: Heather Seidel/ The Wall Street Journal

Google Cloud president Tariq Shaukat said in the release that the company’s goal in health care centers on “ultimately improving outcomes, reducing costs, and saving lives.”

“As the healthcare environment continues to rapidly evolve, we must transform to better meet the needs and expectations of those we serve as well as our own caregivers and healthcare providers,” said Eduardo Conrado, an executive vice president at Ascension.

Google and nonprofit Ascension have parallel financial motives. Google has assigned dozens of engineers to Project Nightingale so far, without charging for the work, because it hopes to use the framework to sell similar products to other health systems. Its end goal is to create an omnibus search tool to aggregate disparate patient data and host it all in one place, documents show.

The project is being developed under Google’s cloud division, which trails rivals like Amazon and Microsoft in market share. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said repeatedly this year that finding new areas of growth for cloud is a priority.

Ascension, a Catholic chain of 2,600 hospitals, doctors’ offices and other facilities, aims in part to improve patient care. It also hopes to mine data to identify additional tests that could be necessary or other ways in which the system could generate more revenue from patients, documents show. Ascension is also eager for a faster system than its existing decentralized electronic record-keeping network.

Google, like many of its Silicon Valley peers, has at times drawn criticism for not doing enough to protect user privacy. Its YouTube unit agreed in September to pay $170 million in fines and make changes to its practices in response to complaints that it illegally collected data on children to sell ads. YouTube neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.

Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google hid a flaw that exposed hundreds of thousands of birth dates, contact information and other personal data of subscribers in its now-defunct social-networking website Google Plus, in part because of fears that the incident could trigger regulatory scrutiny. Google said at the time it went beyond legal requirements in determining not to inform users."
25,2019-12-18,Reverenter,1,"""During a gold rush, sell shovels.""","As the old saying goes, the most surefire method of profiting off of an emerging market is to enable others to seize the opportunity rather than trying your luck yourself.

Below is a list of the emerging markets that come to my mind. This certainly isn't exhaustive, so input of additional upcoming markets is appreciated. Just to reiterate, the goal isn't to speculate which companies will be the leaders in these areas (ex.
